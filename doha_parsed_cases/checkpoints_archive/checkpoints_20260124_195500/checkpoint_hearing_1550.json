    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his combined responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief comments, three of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as engineer with his current employer since August 2017, and previously worked for the same contractor as a systems administrator from March 2016 until July 2017. A 2001 high school graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in 2013, and he earned additional credits from a college but no other degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in November 2004, and served on active duty, including two tours in Iraq (August 2005 until December 2005, and December 2007 until December 2008), until he was discharged in March 2013 with a general discharge under honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance in 2016. He was married in 2007, and he has five children, born in 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2017 (twins).

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 10, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \na Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On August 23, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant first responded to the SOR because his response was \nundated and failed to follow the guidelines previously set forth. On November 11, 2019, \nhe again responded to the SOR, and he elected to have his case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on December 17, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the \nFORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on \nDecember 30, 2019. His response was due on January 29, 2020. Applicant chose not to \nrespond to the FORM, for as of February 24, 2020, no response had been received. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 24, 2020. The record closed on February 24, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his combined responses to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief \ncomments, three of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas engineer with his current employer since August 2017, and previously worked for the \nsame contractor as a systems administrator from March 2016 until July 2017. A 2001 high \nschool graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in 2013, and he earned additional \ncredits from a college but no other degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in November \n2004, and served on active duty, including two tours in Iraq (August 2005 until December \n2005, and December 2007 until December 2008), until he was discharged in March 2013 \nwith a general discharge under honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance \nin 2016. He was married in 2007, and he has five children, born in 2012, 2013, 2015, and \n2017 (twins).  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated March 2, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May \n1, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 7, 2018); and Item 2 \n(Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated November 11, 2019).  \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nApplicant reported that he was unemployed from March 2013, when he was \ndischarged from the U.S. Army, until September 2013; and from January 2015, when he \nwas terminated for tardiness, until April 2015. He attributed his financial problems to only \none factor: he was not earning enough money. (Item 4, at 24)  \nIn his November 2016 SF 86, Applicant denied having any delinquent accounts. \n(Item 3 (2016 SF 86), at 43-44) However, when he was interviewed by an investigator \nwith the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on June 7, 2018, after being \nconfronted by the investigator, he discussed various accounts, but contended that he was \nunaware that they were delinquent, or as he characterized them individually, a \u201cnegative \naccount.\u201d (Item 4, at 44-47) The OPM investigator offered Applicant the opportunity to \nfurnish documentation regarding his delinquent accounts that they discussed, but he \nfailed to do so during or after the interview. (Item 4, at 20-23)  \n The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $28,082, but \nas Department Counsel noted, there was a scrivener\u2019s error to one of the allegations, and \nthe actual amount should have been $27,362. The accounts can be divided into two \ngroups: a. those for which Applicant acknowledged that he had taken no action prior to \nthe issuance of the SOR, but which he intended to take care of them soon, after he \ncompletes resolving the smaller accounts; and b. those for which Applicant contended \nthat as of \u201ctoday,\u201d the account had been settled.   \nIn the first group, there are three delinquent accounts, set forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. is an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $14,600 that was placed for collection \nand charged off in February 2016. (Item 5, at 6; Item 6, at 2; Item 4, at 23; Item 2). SOR \n\u00b6 1.b. is a personal loan with a past-due and unpaid balance of $4,252 that was placed \nfor collection and charged off in November 2013, but as of April 2019, the unpaid balance \nhad increased to $11,173. (Item 5, at 5; Item 6, at 2; Item 4, at 23; Item 2) SOR \u00b6 1.c., as \ninformally amended, is a personal loan with an unpaid balance of $4,200 that was placed \nfor collection in November 2013. (Item 5, at 13; Item 6, at 2; Item 4, at 21; Item 2) \nIn the second group, there are four delinquent accounts which Applicant contended \nhe had resolved. They are set forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.d. is an unspecified type of \naccount with an unpaid balance of $306 that was placed for collection and charged off in \nJune 2014. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 2); SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a credit-card account with an unpaid \nbalance of $1,178 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at \n6; Item 4, at 22-23) SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $1,861 \nthat was placed for collection in February 2015. (Item 5, at 13; Item 4, at 20) SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nis a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $965 that was placed for collection in \nFebruary 2016. (Item 5, at 13; Item 4, at 20) \nOther than Applicant\u2019s unverified contentions regarding his efforts to resolve the \nlast four delinquent accounts, there is no documentary evidence, such as repayment \nplans, cancelled checks, bank account registers, receipts from creditors, or other material \ncorrespondence between him and his creditors to support his position. In December 2019, \nDepartment Counsel noted in the FORM that Applicant had not provided any \ndocumentation to support his contentions in his Answer to the SOR. Despite that notice, \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nApplicant failed to furnish any material documentation. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts have not yet entered the \nprocess of being resolved. \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR, as informally amended, alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $27,362. Two of those debts became delinquent as early as 2013, and by \nthe time the record closed in February 2020, three of them had admittedly not been \naddressed by Applicant, and he offered no documentary proof that he had addressed the \nremaining four delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there \nis no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an \nability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to only one factor: he was not earning enough money. \nAs noted above, two of those debts became delinquent as early as 2013, and another \nbecame delinquent in 2014. At least until the date the record closed, none of his \ndelinquent accounts were conclusively addressed by Applicant. A debt that became \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)).  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for several years, \nis sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent and they are likely \nto remain unchanged. Applicant completed his SF 86 in November 2016; underwent his \nOPM interview in June 2018, when he was offered the opportunity to submit \ndocumentation regarding his delinquent accounts; and the SOR was issued in August \n2019. Each step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. In November 2019, he promised to \nsatisfy his debts \u201csoon.\u201d As of the closing of the record, he has taken no actions to \naddress, much less resolve, any of his delinquent accounts. None of his delinquent debts \nare even in the process of being addressed. \n \nBased on the evidence, Applicant failed to resolve any of his delinquent accounts \nor submit recommended documentation in or after June 2018 \u2013 approximately 20 months \nago. An applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and \nself-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)).  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIn the absence of any positive activity by Applicant, of financial counseling, and a \nbudget, it remains difficult to determine if he is currently in a better position financially \nthan he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as \nengineer with his current employer since August 2017, and previously worked for the \nsame contractor as a systems administrator from March 2016 until July 2017. A 2001 high \nschool graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in 2013, and he earned additional \ncredits from a college but no other degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in November \n2004, and served on active duty, including two tours in Iraq (August 2005 until December \n2005, and December 2007 until December 2008), until he was discharged in March 2013 \nwith a general discharge under honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance \nin 2016. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has seven delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $27,362. Two of those debts became delinquent as early as 2013, and by \nthe time the record closed in February 2020, three of them had admittedly not been \naddressed by Applicant, and he offered no documentary proof that he had addressed the \nremaining four delinquent debts. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is abysmal at best, delaying any resolution efforts, \nsupported by documentation, at least until after the record closed in February 2020. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on September 27, 2019, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to other \nadministrative judges on November 27, 2019, and December 3, 2019, and reassigned \nto me on January 8, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on January 14, 2020. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked AE G through J and admitted \nwithout objection. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2018. He is applying for a security clearance for the \nfirst time. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree that was awarded in 2003 and a master\u2019s degree \nthat he earned in 2009. He completed additional courses toward a doctorate, but he did \nnot earn a PhD. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 48-\n51, 58-60; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant financed his education through student loans. He was unemployed and \nunderemployed after he completed his education. He worked as a taxi driver from 2014 \nto 2016. He was arrested for an alcohol-related driving offense in September 2016. He \nlost his taxi job after his driver\u2019s license was revoked. He was unemployed again for an \nextended period. (Tr. at 57-58; GE 1, 2) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 15 defaulted federal student loans totaling about $195,000; a \ndefaulted $16,721 private student loan; and a charged-off $2,384 credit card account. \nApplicant admitted owing all of the student loans and the credit card debt. \n \nApplicant paid $253 toward his federal student loans in February 2019. The IRS \nwithheld $3,413 from his income tax refund the same month and applied it to his student \nloans. He entered into a loan rehabilitation agreement for his 15 federal student loans in \nMarch 2019. The balance of the loans at that time was $237,123. The monthly payment \nwas $253. He made all of the required monthly payments through October 2019, and \nhis loans were considered rehabilitated and in good standing. (Tr. at 25-28; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; AE A, B, G, J) \n \nIn December 2019, Applicant was approved for a Revised Pay As You Earn \nRepayment Plan (REPAYE Plan)1 for his rehabilitated federal student loans. His \nmonthly payment will be based on his income. His current monthly payment is $72, but \nwill be revised in March 2020. He expects the payments to be about $300 per month. If \nhe makes the required payments for 25 years, any remaining balance will be forgiven. \nThe balance of the 15 loans was about $204,200. The difference from the $237,123 \nfigure appears to be from payments and the elimination of some fees and penalties after \nthe loans were rehabilitated. (Tr. at 25-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C) \n \nApplicant paid $1,913 in January 2020 as settlement in full for the $2,384 \ncharged-off credit card account. His grandfather managed and paid the $16,721 private \nstudent loan until he passed away in 2015. Applicant settled the loan in January 2020 \nfor $6,643, which will be paid by a $277 payment, followed by 23 monthly payments of \n$276. (Tr. at 30-39, 42-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D, G, H, I) \n \nApplicant admitted that he was somewhat cavalier about his student loans. He \nrealizes that he could have started the process years ago, but he was unfamiliar with his \noptions. He received financial counseling through his employer. He credibly testified that \n                                                          \n1 See https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans/income-driven.  \n\n \n3 \n \nhe intends to continue to pay his student loans. He will always be able to pay his federal \nstudent loans because the payments are based on his income. He knows that the loans \nhave to be paid, and that failure to do so could adversely affect his security clearance \nand his job. His finances are otherwise in order. (Tr. at 24-29, 52-56, 60-62, 70-72; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his moral character and superior job \nperformance. He is praised for his work ethic, professionalism, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and adherence to rules and regulations. (AE F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n4 \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand a delinquent credit card debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment. However, some \nof the unemployment was due to his alcohol-related arrest. He should have been more \ndiligent about his student loans. Nonetheless, he consistently paid his federal student \nloans under the rehabilitation program; and he now has an income-based repayment \nplan. If he makes the required payments for 25 years, any remaining balance will be \nforgiven. He settled and paid the consumer debt, and he settled the private student \nloan. He has a strong incentive to continue to pay his student loans, and he credibly \ntestified that he intends to do so. There are clear indications that his financial problems \nare being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is applicable. The other mitigating \nconditions are partially applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.q: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted both allegations, with explanations. His admissions are adopted as a finding of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at his present job in December 2017. Except for two months of unemployment from October to December 2017, Applicant has worked for a federal contractor since 1998.

(Tr. 21, 23, 26-27, 34; GE 1) The SOR alleged one charged-off and one collection debt (a home improvement loan and a personal loan to pay for their son\u2019s private secondary education) totaling approximately $81,000. The debts are established by a credit report from November February 2018, Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.o).

The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 11, 2019, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 5, 2020, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 3, 2020. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-3, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was identified as \n\n \n2 \n \nHE I. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE A-J) at hearing, which were admitted. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE II. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non March 11, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted both allegations, with explanations. His \nadmissions are adopted as a finding of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in December 2017. Except for two months of unemployment from \nOctober to December 2017, Applicant has worked for a federal contractor since 1998. \nHe has held a security clearance for over 25 years without incident. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He has been married for 30 years and has one adult son. (Tr. 21, 23, \n26-27, 34; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged one charged-off and one collection debt (a home improvement \nloan and a personal loan to pay for their son\u2019s private secondary education) totaling \napproximately $81,000. The debts are established by a credit report from November \nFebruary 2018, Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.o). (Tr. 24, 36-39, 55; GE 2) \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased a family home for approximately \n$450,000. They financed this purchase with two loans secured by a primary and a \nsecondary mortgage. Applicant earned approximately $120,000 yearly at the time and \nhis wife earned approximately $75,000 yearly. Their monthly payments on both \nmortgages was approximately $2,200 (the two mortgages were held by the same bank). \nThey made their monthly mortgage payments until about 2010. (Tr. 34-35, 40-41, 51-53, \n55) \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant took out a home improvement loan of approximately $45,000 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). This loan was apparently not secured by his residence. Applicant incurred \nthis loan to add a swimming pool to his property along with ancillary landscaping. \nApplicant estimated his monthly payments on this debt were $400. In 2006 or 2007, \nApplicant obtained another non-secured personal loan to fund his child\u2019s private \nsecondary education in the amount of approximately $37,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant \nincurred this loan because his child was associating with an undesirable crowd at his \npublic school causing disciplinary and legal concerns. Applicant felt that sending his \nchild to a private school away from his son\u2019s current associates would be in his child\u2019s \nbest interests. He funded this education with the aforementioned loan. Applicant does \nnot recall the amount of his monthly payments on this loan, but believes they were \nunder $1,000. Applicant claims that he made his monthly payments on both loans until \napproximately 2009, when his wife became ill and stopped working, thus reducing their \noverall income. The date of last action on the home-improvement loan was in March \n2012 when it was in a \u201ccollection\u201d status. The education loan was charged off in April \n\n \n3 \n \n2012. Applicant did not receive IRS 1099-C, cancellation of debt notices, for either loan. \n(Tr. 36, 38-40, 42, 51-52, 5; GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife became ill in 2009, incurred additional medical treatment \nthereafter, and was unable to return to work. She has not applied for social security \ndisability payments. As a result of this income loss, Applicant\u2019s residence was \nforeclosed in approximately 2010, when he stopped making his monthly payments upon \nthe advice of his lender. This advice was predicated on allowing Applicant to qualify for \na mortgage modification. However, a modification never occurred and Applicant lost the \nproperty through foreclosure. Between 2010 and 2012, Applicant claims that he sought \nto negotiate with the creditor holding the two SOR debts. He documented sending the \ncreditor a letter in April 2012 requesting to negotiate lower payments on the two loans. \nHe did not get a reply and had no further communications with this lender until after \nOctober 2019, when he received the SOR. Applicant admitted that he stopped paying \non the two loans in 2012 because he became frustrated that the lender would not \nnegotiate with him. Neither of the loans appear on his current credit report. (Tr. 38, 40-\n46, 52-53, 55-56; AE G-H) \n \n \nApplicant provided a budget, which showed that he has approximately a $1,000 \nmonthly remainder after paying his regular monthly expenses. He testified that in \nNovember 2019, he obtained a $34,000 loan to pay off several high interest credit \ncards. His monthly payments on this new loan is $893. His credit report showed that he \nhad made two payments as of February 2020. He has a retirement account valued at \napproximately $100,000. His current income is approximately $162,000 annually and he \nreceives a $1,800 monthly pension payment from an earlier job. (Tr. 46-47, 57-58, 62; \nGE 3; AE H-I) \n \n \nApplicant was unable to provide copies of his recent job performance appraisals \nbecause they included proprietary information his company did not want made public. \nHe provided copies of awards and certifications he has earned over his career. His work \nhas secured five patents for his employers. He also provided six letters from current and \nformer colleagues and personal friends who noted his trustworthiness, honesty, and \nother admirable character traits. Two colleagues recommended that Applicant retain his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 33; AE B-F, J)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n4 \n \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n5 \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant accumulated two significant delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts were incurred from 2005 to 2007, they \nremain unpaid and therefore are deemed continuing current obligations. His decision to \nstop paying on these debts because he was frustrated that the lender would not \nnegotiate lower payments with him casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not fully applicable.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s illness resulting in her unemployment was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. He also initially acted responsibly by contacting his lender to \nnegotiate lower payments on the two debts, but his decision to stop making payments \nbecause the lenders refused to negotiate, and his failure to continue communicating \nwith the lender until he received the SOR were not responsible actions. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nnot fully applicable.  \n \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. Even though the two \nSOR debts have been removed from his credit report, there is no proof that he paid \nthem. He failed to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. Given the unpaid \nstatus of his debts, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand AG 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service, his awards and certifications, \nhis character references, his wife\u2019s illness, which led to her unemployment, and the \ncircumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has \nmade insufficient and untimely efforts to resolve his debts. He has not established a \nmeaningful track record of debt management, as evidenced by his recent need to obtain \na consolidation loan to pay high-interest credit-card debt, which causes me to question \nhis ability to resolve his debts.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, \nAppendix C, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.)   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate foreign influence concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 30, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the foreign influence guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

Applicant received the file of relevant materials \n(FORM) on May 1, 2020 and interposed no objections to the materials in the FORM. \nHe did not supplement the record. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly (a) has a daughter who is a citizen of \nIsrael who resides in Belgium while employed by the government of Israel in the Israel \nEmbassy in Brussels Belgium, (b) has a mother-in-law and father-in-law who are \ncitizens and residents of Israel; and (c) has a brother who is a citizen and resident of \nIsrael.

Implementation of \ncertain fundamental laws, orders, and regulations legally depend on the existence of a \n\u201cstate of emergency,\u201d which has been in effect since 1948. \nUnder the Basic Laws, the Knesset has the power to dissolve the government \nand mandate elections. The nationwide Knesset elections in 2015, which were \nconsidered free and fair, resulted in a coalition government led by Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu. The Knesset voted on December 26, 2018 to dissolve itself and \nset April 9, 2019, as the date for national elections.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThe guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

With his Israeli passport, Applicant is able to \nenter and exit Israel without a visa. He has a younger daughter who is a citizen of Israel \nand works for the Israeli embassy in Brussels Belgium. He has a mother-in-law and \nbrother who are citizens and residents of Israel. Security concerns are raised under the \nforeign influence guideline due to Applicant\u2019s longstanding family ties to Israel, and due \nto his youngest daughter\u2019s employment by the Israeli Embassy in Belgium. \nDespite encouraging developments in Israel and strong U.S. bilateral relations \nwith the country, considerable security risks still remain. Terrorist attacks from the \nPalestinians operating from the Gaza strip have long plagued Israel, and there have \nbeen verified incidents of illegal exporting of dual-use technology by Israel. \nBecause Israel presents some heightened security risks for applicants who have \nfamily members who either reside in the country or work for the Israeli government, \nsecurity concerns remain. With his significant family ties to Israel, Applicant is exposed \nto authorities in the country who might use improper and/or illegal means to obtain \nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through his mother-in-law, \nbrother, or youngest daughter who is employed by the Israeli government in Belgium. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members are relatively infrequent \n(ranging from weekly to quarterly), they are longstanding. And, there is a rebuttable \npresumption that a person with immediate family members in a foreign country has ties \nof affection for, or obligation to, his immediate family members, and this presumption \ncovers in-laws (to include Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law residing in Israel).

Feb. 20, 2002) \nTo be sure, the risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if \nthe foreign country has an authoritarian government that ignores or discounts the rule of \nlaw. Examples include the marginalization of widely accepted civil liberties, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government; the government is \nengaged in a counterinsurgency; terrorists cause a substantial amount of death or \nproperty damage; or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations \nagainst the United States. \nWith respect to Israel, the country is not free from risks of potential hostage \ntaking. Notwithstanding that Israel maintains strong bilateral relations with the United \nStates and recognizes democratic principles of governance, cited areas of security \nconcern continue to plague Israel\u2019s standing with the United States and its Western \nallies. \nTaken together, the personal relationships Applicant has with Israel, and the \nsituations that exist in this country, place a significant burden of persuasion on him to \ndemonstrate that his relationship with any family member who either resides in Israel \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(as with his mother-in-law and brother) or works for the Israeli embassy in Belgium, (as \nwith his youngest daughter) does not pose irreconcilable security risks. Such risks that \ncannot be reconciled or otherwise mitigated could potentially place him in a position of \nhaving to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative \nliving in or visiting Israel, or working for the Israeli government. \nAs a result, the Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant \nand his family members who either reside in Israel or work for the Israeli embassy in \nBelgium, might be subject to exploitation, coercion or duress by civilian or military \nauthorities in these countries to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession \nor control. Applicant\u2019s family ties in Israel warrant some application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions of the foreign influence guideline DC \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, \nregardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d and 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology.\u201d \nApplicable, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation is \u00b6 7(f), \u201dsubstantial business, financial, \nor property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest.\u201d The reported employment relationship his youngest daughter enjoys \nas an employee of the Israeli embassy in Belgium has potential financial benefits that \ncould potentially affect Applicant. \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s family members with ties to Israel have any history to \ndate of being subjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical antecedents limit \nthe risk of any potential conflict situation. Still, the absence of any past coercive \nmeasures taken by Israeli authorities does not absolve Applicant from any pressure or \ncoercive risks in the future given Israel\u2019s checkered history of collection interests and \nactivities in the United States. \nThe nature of the foreign government (Israel in this case), the intelligence-\ngathering and human rights history of the country in issue, and the country\u2019s \ngovernment relations with the United States are among the most important \nconsiderations to be considered when assessing risks associated with an applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties and financial interests in that country (either direct or indirect).

Without more \nclarifying information from Applicant about his family members who either reside in \nIsrael, work for the Israeli government, or maintain dual citizenship and passports with \nIsrael, accurate and reliable risk assessments cannot be made.

While Applicant maintains relatively \ninfrequent contact with his family members (ranging from weekly to quarterly), he \nretains strong affection for each of them with little evidence of any overriding \ncommitments to the United States that he could rely on in any hypothetical pressure \nsituation that could arise with his family members.  \nA Guideline B decision concerning Israel must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers extant in Israel and assess whether Israel is a country \nthat still poses some heightened risks despite its strong bilateral relationship with the \nUnited States. Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the United States in Israel, \nand Israel remains a reported major collector of intelligence information in the United \nStates and its allies, and in those countries who cooperate and assist the United States. \nAlthough Israel remains a strong ally of the United States in the war on terror, \nheightened risks remain that have not been fully mitigated.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 23, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), and Administrative Guidelines (AG) implemented on June 8, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed Applicant that, \nbased on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.  The case was assigned to me on November 20, 2019. The Defense Office of \nAdministrative Hearings (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 13, 2020, \nscheduling the hearing for February 6, 2020. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified in her \nown behalf and presented 13 documents, which were marked AE A through M, and \n\n \n2 \n \nadmitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on February 19, \n2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 35, is married and has two children. She graduated from high school \nin 2003 and attended college classes for several years, the most recent in 2016 until \n2017, but she has not obtained her undergraduate degree. She has received various \ncomputer certifications. (Tr. 30) Applicant completed her security clearance application \non April 24, 2018. She has held a security clearance since 2005. She has been employed \nwith her current employer since October 2015 as a help desk technician. (GE 1) \n  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has delinquent debt in the amount of $39,000, of \nwhich $10,000 is student loan debt. The other delinquent debts are charged-off accounts \nor collection accounts that resulted from her unemployment. Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations and provided explanations. SOR allegation 1.a is a duplicate of 1.f and was \nwithdrawn at the hearing by the Government. \n \nApplicant acknowledged her delinquent debts, but stated that she was unemployed \nfor five months from 2014 to 2015. She disclosed her delinquent debts on her security \nclearance application. Her husband works but his job depends on the seasons and there \nare times when he does not earn very much. (Tr. 66)  \n \nWhen Applicant lost her employment, she cashed out her retirement account \n(401(k)) and received unemployment. She hoped that this would keep her  \n\u201cafloat.\u201d (Tr. 27) When she obtained a job in 2015, her salary was lower than her previous \nincome. Her current employment provides her with about the same income as when she \nwas previously employed. She has taken positive steps to resolve her debts and to live \nfrugally and stopped certain services such as television and landline phone. (Tr. 28) \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.b, a charged-off account in the amount of $10,819, \nApplicant\u2019s husband used the life insurance from his father\u2019s death and paid the entire \namount. The default was the direct result of unemployment at the end of 2014. As \nApplicant prioritized her delinquent debts, this was the last account that was resolved, \nrelating to a consolidation loan. (AE A and C, Tr. 37) \n \nSOR allegation 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $9,809, was a loan \nfrom 2010 for a jeep refinancing. This account became delinquent in 2014 after \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment. This account is now paid. The insurance policy money from \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law was also used to pay this debt. (AE A and D) \n \nSOR allegations 1.d and 1.e, represent student loans from 2016 that were not \nreimbursed by Applicant\u2019s employer because she did not successfully complete the \ncourses. Her employer did reimburse costs for college classes when she received a \npassing grade. (Tr. 40) Applicant received a notice of payment in 2017 and made two \npayments of about $100. (Tr. 41) She admits that she put this account aside and arranged \n\n \n3 \n \na payment plan in 2019. She had made three monthly payments thus far of $352, and will \nbe making ten more payment to rehabilitate the loan. (Tr. 42, AE E) \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.f, a collection account in the amount of $2,474, Applicant \nused a credit card to buy new tires for her car. She had been paying on the account, but \nshe stopped when she was laid off. The tires were purchased in 2013. This account has \nbeen resolved. Applicant paid the account in October 2019. (AE B)  \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.g, a collection account in the amount of $502, Applicant \nhad been making payments of $15 twice a month since 2015. She used some of the life \ninsurance money referred to above to settle the account. (AX F) \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.h, a collection account for dental services for her son \n(dental surgeries) in the amount of $1,882, Applicant has been making payments since \n2015, and the current balance is $375. (AE G) \n \nSOR allegation 1.i, a collection account in the amount of $4,136, Applicant has \nbeen making automatic payments of $17.29 twice a month since late 2015 and the \nbalance is $2,541. She will continue to make these payments through automatic \nwithdrawal until paid in full. (AE H) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage is current. Her annual salary is about $67,000. She obtained \ninformation from a financial counseling website and has a budget. (Tr. 53) She has a Roth \nIRA account. Her husband earns $25 an hour. He pays the mortgage and maintains a \nseparate bank account. They both share responsibility for the children. Applicant does \nnot believe she will continue her on line college classes at this point so that she does not \nincur any more student loans if she does not obtain a passing grade and her employer \ndoes not pay for the course. (Tr. 68) She provided a copy of her current credit report \nshowing that she is current on all accounts. (AE K) \n \nApplicant submitted seven character references and her latest performance \nevaluation.  Her lead supervisor praises Applicant for her highly professional attitude and \na trustworthiness. She is described as one of the hardest-working and most-valued \nemployee on a team of 30. (AE L) Her latest performance evaluation reflects that she had \na productive and successful year and met all expectations. (AE M) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are in major part due to her unemployment in 2014-\n2015. She took a position after that at a lower pay rate. She is now earning income \nequivalent to what her salary was at the time before her unemployment. The \nunemployment was a circumstance beyond her control. Her student debt is the result of \nnot being reimbursed by her employer for her two college courses due to a non-passing \ngrade. Applicant has prioritized her delinquent debt and either paid or arranged a payment \nplan. She did not ignore any creditors. She has paid some accounts and others that were \nin a payment arrangement have been resolved. She has one or two still in an automatic \nwithdrawal payment arrangements. She showed good faith efforts during this time. She \nprovided documentary evidence to support all of her assertions. She has demonstrated \na track record of debt payment and there is an indication that her financial situation is \n\n \n6 \n \nunder control. She obtained information from a financial website and utilizes a budget. \nAG \u00b6 20(a)-20(d) are established. Applicant met her burden to mitigate the financial \nconcerns set out in the SOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.i. for \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s work career  and recommendations, I conclude \nthat Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. I \nconclude that it is with the national interest to grant her continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 4, 2019, Applicant owed two student-loan debts of $11,054 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $7,329 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in collection; a $9,546 charged-off automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b); two mobile-phone debts of $2,091 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $1,255 (SOR \u00b6 1.u); four delinquent credit-card debts of $603 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $377 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); $345 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and $517 (SOR \u00b6 1.t); a $438 satellite-television debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and 11 medical debts in collection totaling $2,804 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.s). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and provided documentation of some payments toward his debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.o, and 1.u, and to the collection agency that he asserted holds his medical bills in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i to 1.p and 1.q. He also indicated that he had established a repayment arrangement for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.t. (Item 2.) After considering Items 1 through 7, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (Item 2), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 59 years old and a high school graduate who attended a technical college from December 2010 to February 2011. He served in the U.S. military from July 1985 to February 1987 when he was given a general discharge for marijuana use. Applicant has been married to his current spouse September 2009. He was married to his first wife from August 1992 to July 2008. He has a son age 41, two daughters ages 28 and 2",

He has been making small payments on the debts, but he has yet to establish that \nhis financial issues are no longer of security concern. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nOn November 4, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record without a hearing. On December 23, 2019, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 7. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) forwarded a copy of the \nFORM to Applicant and informed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 12, 2020, and he submitted an undated response \nto the FORM that was received by DOHA on February 11, 2020. On February 14, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel indicated that the Government had no objection to Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the FORM. On February 18, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on February 21, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 4, a summary report of personal subject \ninterviews (PSI) of Applicant conducted on February 7, 2019, February 8, 2019, and \nFebruary 18, 2019. The summary report was included in the DOD Report of Investigation \n(ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background \nROI may be received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided \nit is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not \nbear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows: \n  \n*IMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interviews (PSI) (Item 4) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to the FORM, you can comment on whether [the] PSI \nsummary accurately reflects the information you provided to the authorized \nOPM investigator, and you may make any corrections, additions, deletions, \nand updates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate. \nAlternatively, you may object on the ground that the report is unauthenticated \nby a Government witness and the document may not be considered as \nevidence. If no objections are raised in your response to this FORM, or if you \ndo not respond to this FORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that \nyou have waived any objections to the admissibility of the summary and may \nconsider the summary as evidence in your case. \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant did not mention the PSI in his response to the FORM. Concerning whether \nApplicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, \nApplicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond \nthose afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of \nthe Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by him or \nproven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide \nfor a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of \nhis opportunity to object to the admissibility of the PSI, to comment on the PSI, and to make \nany corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the PSI. Applicant is deemed to \nhave waived any objections to the PSI. \n \nAccordingly, Items 1 through 7 were accepted into the record as exhibits for the \nGovernment. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was admitted as Applicant exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 4, 2019, Applicant owed two \nstudent-loan debts of $11,054 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $7,329 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in collection; a $9,546 \ncharged-off automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b); two mobile-phone debts of $2,091 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nand $1,255 (SOR \u00b6 1.u); four delinquent credit-card debts of $603 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $377 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.f); $345 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and $517 (SOR \u00b6 1.t); a $438 satellite-television debt in collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h); and 11 medical debts in collection totaling $2,804 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.s). (Item 1.) \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the debts and provided documentation of \nsome payments toward his debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.o, and 1.u, and to the collection \nagency that he asserted holds his medical bills in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i to 1.p and 1.q. He also \nindicated that he had established a repayment arrangement for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.t. (Item \n2.) \n \n \nAfter considering Items 1 through 7, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR \n(Item 2), and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of \nfact: \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and a high school graduate who attended a technical \ncollege from December 2010 to February 2011. He served in the U.S. military from July \n1985 to February 1987 when he was given a general discharge for marijuana use. \nApplicant has been married to his current spouse September 2009. He was married to his \nfirst wife from August 1992 to July 2008. He has a son age 41, two daughters ages 28 and \n20, and a stepchild age 17. (Item 3.) \n \nNo information was provided about Applicant\u2019s employment for approximately the \nfirst 20 years after his military discharge. Between August 2006 and March 2018, he \nworked primarily as a telecommunications technician or engineer for a succession of \nemployers outside of the defense industry. He was unemployed from December 2010 to \nFebruary 2011, while attending a technical college, and most recently from November 2017 \n\n4 \n \nto January 2018. Since March 2018, Applicant has been employed as a technician for a \ndefense contractor in support of the U.S. military. (Item 3.) \n \nApplicant built a new home for his family into which they moved in December 2015. \nHe obtained a 30-year mortgage loan for $327,635. At the time, he was earning $95,000 in \nannual salary. In October 2016, he was laid off. He was given six weeks notice and a \nseverance package. He found another job almost immediately, but at loss of $30,000 in \nannual salary from his previous job. He fell behind 30 days on his mortgage loan payments \nin May 2017, but brought the loan current in July 2017. However, Applicant was laid off in \nNovember 2017 when his then employer lost the contract, and he was unemployed until \nJanuary 2018. He collected unemployment compensation, but could not maintain the \npayments on his mortgage. He contacted his mortgage lender and was told that he could \nnot obtain a loan re-modification until his loan was 120 days past due. As of May 2018, his \naccount was $13,444 past due on a balance of $327,427. In July 2018, he successfully \nmodified his loan. In October 2018, he began repaying his loan under a modified payment \nagreement where the delinquency was added to the end of his loan and his monthly \npayments were lowered from $2,094 to $1,668. He made his loan payments on time until \nNovember 2019, when he missed his payment. As of December 2019, his modified \nmortgage was $1,997 past due. (Items 2-7.) In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant admitted \nthat he was 15 days behind on his mortgage, but he borrowed $827 from his 401k to catch \nup on his loan. Available loan documentation shows that he made his January 2020 \npayment late. His loan has a principal balance of $229,629. His home has a taxable value \nof $383,065, so he has considerable equity in his residence. (AE A.)  \n \nApplicant began working for his defense-contractor employer in March 2018, earning \napproximately $63,000 a year. (Item 4.) In application for initial DOD clearance eligibility, \nApplicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) on April 3, 2018. In response to financial record inquiries, Applicant \nindicated that he was currently seeking assistance from a credit-counseling service or \nsimilar resource to resolve financial difficulties in that he had entered into a program to \nlower his interest and payments on debts that he did not specify. He responded \naffirmatively to questions concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, and he \nlisted seven debts: (1) a medical bill of $1,959 from May 2013 that he was reportedly \nrepaying at $25 monthly; (2) a medical bill of $726 from April 2016 that he was repaying at \n$20 monthly (SOR \u00b6 1.o); (3) a school loan of $2,005 in a nine-month rehabilitation \nprogram; (4) a $517 credit-card debt in collection that he was repaying at $35 per month \n(SOR \u00b6 1.t); (5) a $9,581 car-loan debt for a vehicle \u201ctotaled out\u201d in an accident (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \nthat he was reportedly repaying at $20 a month; (6) a $590 credit-card debt from June 2017 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g); and a mortgage loan past due for $9,294 (not alleged). Applicant stated that \nhe fell behind on his home loan due to a job loss in November 2017 [sic] and that he had \nsuccessfully modified the loan to have the delinquency added to the end of a new loan with \na lower monthly repayment. (Item 3.) \n \n \nAvailable credit reports of May 23, 2018 (Item 5), May 15, 2019 (Item 6), and \nDecember 19, 2019 (Item 7), list several delinquencies on Applicant\u2019s credit record. Details \nabout the debts in the SOR and repayment arrangements follow. \n\n5 \n \nStudent loans in collection for $11,054 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $7,329 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \n \n \nApplicant obtained two federal student loans in January 2011, for $3,500 (not \nalleged in SOR) to be repaid at $19 per month, and for $5,415 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), to be repaid at \n$49 per month. Applicant obtained another federal student loan, for $8,500 in September \n2011, with required repayment at $72 per month. (Items 2, 5-7.) He defaulted on the three \nloans in July 2017, and his debts were sold or transferred in March 2018. (Item 5.) He \nmade $25 payments in April 2018 and May 2018, and a $20 payment in July 2018. He \nconsolidated his three student loans, which were in collection. On October 5, 2018, he \nentered into an arrangement to make $75 monthly payments toward his student loans. He \nmade $75 payments in November 2018 and December 2018. On February 7, 2019, during \nhis PSI, Applicant explained that he made $75 payments in November 2018 and December \n2018, but that the company holding his loans made an error in his paperwork. He stated \nthat he was awaiting a new loan agreement so that he could resume payments toward a \nconsolidated balance of $22,081. (Item 4.) \n \n \nAvailable documentation shows that he made a payment of $35 on February 16, \n2019. As of February 19, 2019, his student loans had past-due balances of $4,425 (not \nalleged in SOR), $12,995 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and $8,616 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and were included in an \nincome-based repayment plan requiring monthly payments of $5 to start on February 20, \n2019. Applicant began making $10 monthly payments ($5 extra each month) toward his \nstudent-loan debts. (Item 2.) As of October 30, 2019, the aggregate balance of his three \noutstanding student loans was $22,824. Payments of $10 monthly were being automatically \ndebited from his bank account. As of November 2019, his student loans were current with \nrespective balances of $11,473 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $7,607 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and $3,852 (not alleged \nin SOR). (Item 2.) He paid $23 toward his student loans in December 2019. As of March \n2020, his student loans were in administrative forbearance with a balance of $23,179. \nApplicant explained in response to the FORM that he completed a rehabilitation program to \nlower his monthly payment from $281 to $203 with his first payment due on March 20, \n2020. (AE A.) \n \nAuto loan charge-off for $9,546 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \n \nIn April 2016, Applicant and his spouse obtained a joint automobile loan for $24,340, \nrequiring repayment at $443 per month. (Items 5-7.) The dealer offered no gap insurance. \nWhen his spouse had an accident in 2017, their insurance company decided \u201cto total out \nthe car,\u201d leaving them owing a $9,500 debt. Applicant states that the creditor would not \nfinance the amount in a new vehicle and instead gave them the options of paying the \nbalance in two or three installment payments, which they could not afford. Applicant made \nno payments after May 2017, and his account was charged off for $9,581. (Items 2, 4.) The \ndebt was placed for collection in April 2018 with $9,561 owed. During his February 2019 \nPSI, Applicant stated that he had been making $25 monthly payments every couple of \nmonths. On February 8, 2019, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he had arranged to \nmake automatic payments of $20 monthly toward this loan deficiency. He provided \ndocumentation of a $20 payment pending as of March 1, 2019. (Item 4.) As of April 2019, \nthe loan balance was past due for $9,546. (Items 5-7.) Applicant presented documentation \n\n6 \n \nof $5 monthly payments toward the debt from May 2019 through November 2019. (Item 2.) \nHis reported balance was $9,511 as of November 30, 2019. (Item 7.) Effective February 28, \n2020, he raised his monthly payment from $5 to $25. (AE A.) \n \nMobile phone debt in collection for $2,091 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \n \n \nAs of May 2018, a collection entity was reporting a past-due balance of $2,106 from \nDecember 2017 in collection. (Item 5.)  During his February 2019 PSI, Applicant denied \nknowing about the debt and indicated that he would establish repayment arrangements if \nthe debt was valid. He subsequently provided the OPM investigator with documentation \nshowing that he arranged to make $20 monthly payments to start on March 1, 2019. (Item \n4.) Applicant now asserts that the creditor would only accept a one-time payment, but he \nbegan repaying the debt at $5 per month starting May 1, 2019. Those payments were \naccepted by the creditor, who was reporting a $2,056 balance as of December 5, 2019. \n(Items 2, 7.) Effective February 28, 2020, Applicant raised his monthly payment from $5 to \n$15. (AE A.) \n \nCredit-card debt in collection for $603 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \n \nA credit-card account was charged off and sold in January 2017 to a collection entity \nwith $603 owed. As of February 2019, Applicant mistakenly believed that the debt was held \nby the same entity managing his accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. (Item 4.) As of May 2019, \nthe debt was unpaid. (Items 5-7.) Applicant arranged to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e at \n$19.45 per month from October 28, 2019, through April 28, 2022. (Item 2.) As of December \n2019, Applicant\u2019s credit report was showing a debt balance of $564 after his November \n2019 payment. (Item 7.) \n \nCollection debt for $377 (SOR \u00b6 1.f, same debt in SOR \u00b6 1.t) \n \n  \nIn April 2017, a credit-card collection debt of $517 was assigned for collection with \nthe entity in SOR \u00b6 1.t. (Items 5-7.) As of May 2018, the account had a past-due balance of \n$377. (Item 5.) During his February 2019 PSI, Applicant related that, about four or five \nyears prior, he and his spouse had several department store credit cards that were \ncharging high interest rates, so they contracted with a debt management company, initially \nto negotiate for lower interest rates on their credit balances. In return for $130 a month, the \ncompany initially managed five accounts. Applicant added accounts to the plan as needed. \n(Item 4.) As of his response to the SOR, the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were being \nmanaged by the company. Payment records show Applicant made lower payments to the \ndebt management company of $115 in February 2019 and April 2019, and increased his \npayments to $130 in March 2019 and from May 2019 through October 2019. (Items 2, 4.) \nAs of October 2019, the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f had a balance of $273. After a payment in \nNovember 2019, his balance was $251. (Items 2, 6-7.) \n \n\n7 \n \nCredit-card debt in collection for $345 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) \n \n \nA charge card opened with a retailer in December 2009 was charged off for $590 \ndue to no payment since March 2017. As of April 2018, the debt was in collection. As of \nApril 2019, the account had a $345 past-due balance. (Items 5-6.)The debt was being \nmanaged by the debt management company with a $234 balance as of October 2019.

(Items 2, 7.) \n  \nSatellite television debt in collection for $438 (SOR 1.h) \n \n \nIn June 2017, a satellite television service provider placed a $438 debt for collection. \nIn January 2018, the debt was acquired by the collection entity in SOR \u00b6 1.h. As of May \n2018, the debt was still outstanding. (Item 5.)  When confronted about the debt during his \nFebruary 2019 PSI, Applicant explained that he had paid the final bill, but the dish \nequipment was still on the roof of his home. He explained that he would contact the creditor \nto return the dish and set up a repayment plan. (Item 4.) In response to the SOR, Applicant \nexplained that he was not satisfied with the service, but the provider would not let him out of \nthe two-year contract. Between May 1, 2019, and November 1, 2019, Applicant made $5 \nmonthly payments toward the debt. His payments were accepted by the creditor. (Item 2.) \nEffective February 28, 2020, he raised his monthly payment from $5 to $15. (AE A.) \n \nMedical collection debt for $686 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) \n \n \nA medical debt of $726 from April 2016 was placed for collection. As of May 2018, \nthe balance was $686. (Item 5.)

(Item 4.) On \nFebruary 8, 2019, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he had arranged to make \nautomatic payments of $20 monthly toward these medical debts, which were from multiple \nknee surgeries. (Item 4.) In response to the FORM, Applicant provided a payment record \nshowing automatic payments of $20 on March 1, 2019, and $10 monthly between April 1, \n2019, and November 1, 2019, to the collection entity reportedly now holding the debt. (Item \n2.) None of those debts were on his credit record with Equifax as of December 2019 (Item \n\n8 \n \n7), even though they have not been fully satisfied. He is continuing to make $10 monthly \npayments toward the medical debts. (AE A.) \n \nWireless telephone debt for collection for $1,255 (SOR \u00b6 1.u) \n \n \nIn August 2017, a wireless services provider placed a $1,255 debt for collection. As \nof May 2018, the debt had not been paid. (Item 5.) During his February 7, 2019 PSI, \nApplicant said the debt was for his spouse\u2019s phone, although he was also on the account, \nand that his spouse cancelled the service prematurely. He denied knowing that the debt \nwas in collections. (Item 4.) On February 8, 2019, Applicant told the OPM investigator that \nhe had arranged to make automatic payments of $20 monthly toward this loan deficiency. \n(Item 4.) In response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that the vendor \u201cwould not let [them] \nout of the unknowing contract we had with them.\u201d He made a $20 payment that was \nprocessed by the creditor on March 1, 2019, and made $5 monthly payments through \nJanuary 2020. (Item 2.) Effective February 28, 2020, Applicant raised his monthly \npayments to $15. (AE A.) \n \n \nAs of May 2018, Applicant was making timely payments on a closed credit-card \naccount with a $1,113 balance; on open credit-card accounts with balances of $58, $322, \nand $1,371; on a joint vehicle loan obtained for $16,726 in May 2017 with a current balance \nof $16,115; and on a home-furnishings debt with a $2,570 balance. (Item 5.) \n \n \nDuring his February 7, 2019 PSI, Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to the \ndecline in household income when he lost his job in October 2016 and then his \nunemployment between November 2017 and January 2018. He indicated that he was \n\u201ctrying to pay creditors here and there and playing catchup on past-due bills.\u201d His spouse \nworks only occasionally as a photographer. (Item 4.) He provided no information about her \nincome. \n \n \nIn its December 2019 FORM, the Government acknowledged Applicant\u2019s payments \non his debts but found them to be \u201cextremely low.\u201d The Government also expressed some \nconcern because he was delinquent on his mortgage loan and car loan payments for the \nvehicle purchased in May 2017. As of December 2019, Applicant was $1,997 past due on \nhis mortgage loan; $1,027 past due on the car loan obtained in May 2017; and $225 past \ndue on a home-furnishings account (balance $2,862) that had been current for over two \nyears until October 2019. In response to the Government\u2019s concerns, Applicant raised his \nmonthly payments on some of his delinquencies effective February 28, 2020, to \u201cthe most \n[he] can pay to fit [his] budget.\u201d Concerning his home loan, he indicated that he brought it \ncurrent with the funds borrowed from his retirement account, although the loan \ndocumentation shows that he requested the withdrawal on February 7, 2020, and the funds \nhad not been disbursed as of February 8, 2020. He indicated that he was no longer behind \non his car loan because he refinanced his loan to lower his monthly payment to $251. \nApplicant made car payments of $682 in September 2019, $1,745 on December 23, 2019, \nand $400 on December 30, 2019. A $1,745 payment on December 24, 2019, was returned, \nand he paid nothing in October or November 2019. Account information for the vehicle loan \nshows that, as of February 6, 2020, $758 was due on a loan balance of $12,444. (AE A.) \n\n9 \n \nApplicant did not explain why he fell behind on his mortgage and car loans. He also \nprovided no specifics about his finances, including his household budget, which would \nindicate he has the means to make his student-loan payment initially due on March 20, \n2020. \n \n \nApplicant has been a lead communications technician on a military base for \napproximately two years. He supports all communications on the base, which includes \ntelephone and fiber optic infrastructure. He works 50 to 55 hours most weeks, and is on \ncall. He does not get paid for the on-call time. He indicates that he put two children through \ncollege and is \u201cworking on the next,\u201d and that it is going to take some time for him to \nresolve his delinquent debts. (AE A.) Applicant submitted no evidence about the extent to \nwhich he covered college costs for his children. \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n10 \n \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a nexus \nbetween proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant defaulted on three student loans \nobtained initially for $17,415, including the two loans in the SOR that were taken out for \n$5,415 and $8,500; $9,546 on a loan for a car that was \u201ctotaled\u201d in an accident; two \nwireless phone debts $1,255 and $2,095; a satellite television debt of $438; credit-card \ndebts of $603, $590, and $517; and medical collection debts totaling $2,804. Under AG \u00b6 \n\n11 \n \n19, disqualifying conditions 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. One \nor more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the consumer credit debts became delinquent in 2017. Some \nof the medical debts were incurred more than five years ago, but there is no evidence any \nof them have been fully satisfied. Applicant\u2019s debts are considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his loss of about $30,000 in annual \nincome after his layoff in October 2016; to a period of unemployment from November 2017 \nto January 2018 after another layoff; and to his spouse\u2019s vehicle accident in 2017. The \nunexpected job losses and accident are factors outside of his control that contributed to or \ncaused his financial problems. Some $2,804 of his collection debts stem from multiple \nsurgeries that were likely medically necessary. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability. Even so, \nI have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner when dealing with his \nfinancial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A significant \ncomponent of financially responsible behavior is whether Applicant stayed in contact with \nhis creditors and attempted to resolve debts. The evidence in that regard is somewhat \n\n12 \n \nmixed. There is no evidence that Applicant made any effort to resolve his debts before he \nstarted his current job in March 2018. He made some payments on his student loans, of \n$25 each in April and May 2018, and of $20 in July 2018, but those payments were well \nshort of the $140 required under the loans\u2019 repayment terms. He made larger payments of \n$75 each in November 2018 and December 2018, and apparently was not responsible for \nan error in his paperwork that led to a new income-based agreement requiring only $5 a \nmonth. Starting in February 2019, he made $10 payments toward his student loans, double \nwhat was required, but he did not explain why he was unable to resume his $75 payments. \nApplicant began making $25 payments toward his car-loan deficiency (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in 2018, \nbut his payments were not consistent. During his February 7, 2019 PSI, he indicated that \nhe had arranged to make $20 monthly payments. He made only one or two payments of \n$20 before he dropped his payment to $5 a month. Similarly, he told the OPM investigator \nthat he would repay his $2,091 mobile phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) at $20 a month. He made \nonly $5 monthly payments. He handled his medical collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.n and \n1.p-1.s similarly, reducing his payment to only $5 after he had reportedly arranged to make \n$20 payments. There is no evidence that Applicant made any payments toward the $603 \ncredit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) before late October 2019. He made only $5 monthly payments \ntoward the satellite television debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h) from May 2019 to February 2020. Not \nenough is known about Applicant\u2019s budget or his circumstances to make a reasonable \nassessment about whether he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He indicated in \nresponse to the FORM that he put two children through college, but he provided no \ninformation about his contributions to his children\u2019s educational expenses. \n \nApplicant demonstrated some good faith under AG \u00b6 20(d) by taking steps to \naddress his delinquencies well before the SOR was issued. He began using the services of \na debt resolution company some four to five years ago, initially in an attempt to lower the \ninterest rates on his and his spouse\u2019s credit-card accounts. He has continued to make \npayments on his delinquent debts, although in minimal amounts that make it difficult to \nconclude that his financial problems are safely behind him, especially where, as of \nDecember 2019, he was $1,027 past-due on his car loan obtained in May 2017 and $1,997 \npast due on his mortgage loan. He offered no explanation for his failure to make his car \npayment in October 2019 and November 2019, or his mortgage payment in November \n2019. As of December 2019, he was also $225 past due on the furniture debt that had \nbeen current in May 2018. By February 2020, Applicant had brought his mortgage and car \nloans current, but he had to borrow from his retirement account to catch up on his house \npayment. He had to modify his car loan and add the delinquency to the end of his loan to \nbring that account current. \n \nFavorable findings are returned on his student loans because they have been \nremoved from default status. Applicant has also made enough progress toward repaying \nthe credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6 1.f (same debt in SOR \u00b6 1.t) and 1.g to return favorable \nfindings of those debts. While AG \u00b6 20(d) has some applicability in that Applicant shows a \nwillingness to resolve all of his delinquencies, it is not clear that Applicant will be able to \nmake his scheduled student loan payment, even at his claimed modified level of $203 per \nmonth. He has not demonstrated that he has the means to make all his promised debt \npayments without falling behind on other obligations. It is unclear whether any of the \n\n13 \n \nmedical collection debts, some of which are under $50, have been fully satisfied. There is \nno clear indication that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control, and it \nwas not shown that he has had any financial counseling that is required for mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20(c). AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \n \n \nApplicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has satisfied each \ndebt in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. June 5, 2006). \nHowever, he is required under Appeal Board precedent to demonstrate not only that he has \na plan to resolve his financial problems, but that he has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006.) \nWhile he is credited with raising his debt payments from $5 per month to $15 per month on \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, and 1.u, and to $25 per month on the car-loan deficiency in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, those new payments became effective on February 28, 2020, too recently for a \nshowing that he can make those payments without stressing his budget to the point of \nfalling behind on other accounts. The financial considerations security concerns are not \nadequately mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. In \nexceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated. Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants \nDOHA administrative judges the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See also \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018 (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position . . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \n\n14 \n \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated in Appendix C is granted to any \nadjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance eligibility \nwhen they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) I have considered the \nexceptions under Appendix C because of Applicant\u2019s efforts to address his debts, but still \nhave some doubts about Applicant\u2019s financial judgment. It is particularly concerning that \nApplicant was delinquent on such important obligations as his mortgage and car loans as \nrecently as early December 2019. Should Applicant continue to address his debts, he may \nbe able to establish at some future date that his financial situation no longer presents a \nsecurity concern. Much remains unknown about his expenses. For the reasons noted \nabove, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.s: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M.

The hearing was held as \nscheduled. I received five Government exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 GE 5 and seven Applicant\u2019s \nexhibits (AE) A - AE G, together with the testimony of Applicant.

Applicant\u2019s \nroommate has been paying this debt through a garnishment since August 2020. (AE I; Tr. \n62) \nWhen Applicant first began working as a systems administrator eight years ago, he \nearned $34,000. (Tr. 29) As the only member of his extended family with a steady job, he \nwould sometimes overextend himself financially to help relatives pay bills.

(Tr. 66) He has $2,000 of monthly discretionary \nincome that he applies to his delinquencies, and he has $500 in savings. (Tr. 64) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in November 2018. He did not \nlist the July 2018 judgment, as required in response to Section 26. Applicant contends that \nthe omission was unintentional, as he did not know about this judgment until after he \ncompleted the security clearance application. (Tr. 60) Applicant and the primary borrower \non the loan were roommates when the judgment was filed. (Tr. 61) The initial pleading lists \nboth gentlemen as codefendants. (GE 4) The court records indicate that the court issued \ntwo summons in April 2018 and that service was executed on two individuals on June 20, \n2018. (GE 4 at 3) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s outstanding debts generate concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) . . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s career began approximately eight years ago. Although he was then in his \nearly twenties and only earned $34,000 annually, many of his family members solicited his \nfinancial help. Applicant obliged, overextending himself financially in the process. As for two \nof the delinquent car loans, Applicant did not default on them until they were totaled and the \ninsurance companies rejected his gap insurance claims. Applicant has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances, satisfying all of the SOR debts except the delinquent car notes as \nalleged in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.i. He is paying subparagraph 1.a through a \nnegotiated agreement, the primary borrower is making payments on the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.i, and Applicant is attempting to settle subparagraph 1.b. Applicant\u2019s salary \nhas increased by $40,000 over the past five years. He has $2,000 in monthly discretionary \nincome, $500 in savings, and maintains a budget. His finances are now organized through \na budget app that he maintains. He earns a significant amount more money than he did \nwhen he incurred the majority of the debt, and has ample discretionary income and savings \nto prevent a recurrence of future financial problems. I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(c), \nand 20(d) are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s omission of a July 2018 judgment, stemming from a delinquent car loan, \nfrom his November 2018 e-QIP raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. Applicant contends \nthat as the loan cosigner, he was unaware that the primary borrower was behind on the \ndebt, and he was unaware that debt collection process legal proceedings had been \ninitiated. This explanation is not credible in light of the court records of service of process, \nand the fact that Applicant and the primary borrower were roommates. Under these \ncircumstances AG \u00b6 16(a) applies without mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe positive inference generated by Applicant\u2019s resolution of his financial problems \nare insufficient to outweigh the negative security inference generated by his failure to \ndisclose a judgment, as required on his security clearance application. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that he has failed to mitigate the security concerns \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.I: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 30, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 27, 2020. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 13, 2020, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 5, 2020.  The Government offered six exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. The Applicant \noffered seven exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G, which were \nadmitted without objection.  Applicant also testified on her own behalf. The record \n\n \n2 \n \nremained open until close of business on March 19, 2020, to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted one \nPost-Hearing Exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was \nadmitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on March 16, 2020. \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old and single.  She has a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in \nelectrical engineering.  She holds the positon of systems engineer for a defense \ncontractor.  She seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment \nin the defense industry.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 10 delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $60,000.  Her student loan debt totals approximately $50,233.39 of the \ntotal.  The remaining debt is medical debt.  In her Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations and provides explanations.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated October \n19, 2018; May 10, 2019; January 23, 2020; and March 4, 2020, reflect that each of \nthese debts was at one point owing.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6.)  \n \n \nApplicant is a native-born American citizen who did not come from a financially \nprivileged background.  Her parents are Haitian immigrants who became naturalized \ncitizens of the United States, wanting better opportunities for themselves and their \nchildren.  Applicant was taught to work hard, obtain her education, and make her \nparents proud, by creating a better life for herself.  Applicant did just that.  She was a \nhigh achiever and an excellent student.  She did exceptionally well in high school and \nwas admitted to a prestigious out-of-state university.  Her parents could not afford to \npay for her college education and so she obtained student loans to attend.  Applicant \nalways had every intent to pay back her student loans.   \n \n \nFrom 2004 to 2007, Applicant completed three and a half years at this university, \nand did well, before a tragic event.  A shooting occurred on campus which killed 20 \npeople.  For her safety, Applicant moved back home and transferred to a local in-state \nuniversity to finish her degree.  This disruption in her education caused even more \nexpenses.  When Applicant transferred to the local in-state university, she initially \nstarted school on a full-time basis, but soon had to go part time, while working odd jobs, \nin order to pay for her living expenses and tuition.  She always lived frugally.  Applicant \ngraduated from this university in May 2014, and had a challenging time obtaining \nemployment.  Two years before she graduated, in 2012 or 2013, some of her student \nloans became due, and Applicant had no ability to pay them.  She tried to defer them, \nbut because they were private loans they could not be deferred beyond five years.  She \ntried to work out a payment plan, but the payments the creditors offered were more than \nshe could afford to pay.  Applicant further testified that when she turned 26, she no \nlonger had medical benefits as a student, and the two medical bills she incurred on the \nSOR became owing and delinquent because she did not have the money to pay them.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIt was not until August 2018, that Applicant obtained a full time job when she was \nhired by her current employer.  At that time, she contacted her creditors, and found out \nthat her debts were in a charged-off or default status.  They offered her settlements, but \nthey were large sums that she did not have.  Applicant started saving her money toward \npaying the settlement amounts as soon as she started working.  Applicant testified that \nshe has paid off all of the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR except one, allegation \n1.b.                     \n \n \nAllegation 1.a., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $13,654.  Applicant settled this debt on October 29, 2019, in the \namount of $1,413.51, and it is deemed paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, and D.)         \n \n \nAllegation 1.b., is a delinquent student loan debt that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $11,797.  Beginning in October of 2019, Applicant started \nmaking regular payments between $100 and $150 monthly to resolve this debt.  She \nplans to continue to do so until the debt is resolved.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and Tr. pp. \n32-34.)     \n \n \nAllegation 1.c., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $10,940.  Applicant settled this debt on October 29, 2019, in the \namount of $1,132.51, and it is deemed paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, and D.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.d., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $6,339.  Applicant settled this debt on October 29, 2019, in the \namount of $656.28, and it is deemed paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, and D.)     \n \n \nAllegation 1.e., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $4,643.  Applicant settled this debt on October 29, 2019, in the \namount of $480.67, and it is deemed paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, and D.)   \n \n \nAllegation 1.f., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $3,007.  Applicant settled this debt on October 29, 2019, in the \namount of $311.31, and it is deemed paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C, and D.)   \n \n \nAllegation 1.g., is a delinquent student loan debt that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $11,286.  Applicant settled this debt on October 29, 2019, in the \namount of $1,205.72, and it is deemed paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, C and D.) \n \n \nAllegation 1.h., is a delinquent medical debt that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $318.  Applicant paid this debt on October 22, 2019.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)    \n \n \nAllegation 1.i., is a delinquent debt that was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $168.  Applicant settled this debt on October 28, 2019.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAllegations 1.j., is a delinquent medical account placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $165.  Applicant paid this debt on October 22, 2019.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)    \n \n \nAn undated letter from the Applicant\u2019s manager indicates that she has been \nApplicant\u2019s manager since February 2019.  Applicant is heavily relied on by her program \nlead, and is considered to be an invaluable member of the team.  Although she is still a \njunior engineer, she is \u201cgood and reliable\u201d, and interfaces well with others.  Applicant is \nhighly valued by the department, and is recommended for a security clearance.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n5 \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant took out student loans in order to obtain a college degree.  Applicant \nindicated that she has always had every intent to pay back her student loans.  A highly \nunexpected tragic event, a shooting on campus, caused her to have to transfer to \nanother university to finish her degree.  Upon graduation, she had difficulty finding \nsuitable employment.  In addition, most of her student loans became due before she \nactually graduated from college.  As a result, she defaulted on the loans.  Because she \nwas unable to pay these debts, she became delinquently indebted, the evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved  or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nCircumstances beyond her control certainly caused Applicant\u2019s financial \ndifficulties.  Since gaining employment Applicant has paid off, or resolved, all but one of \nher delinquent debts. She has acted reasonably and responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  Regarding the remaining student loan, she is making regular monthly \npayments to resolve it and plans to continue to do so until it is resolved.  Applicant has \nshown good judgment and reliability.  There are clear indications that her financial \nproblems of the past are resolved and are under control.  She has also demonstrated a \ngood-faith effort to resolve her debts.  AG \u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) provide full mitigation.  The \nFinancial Considerations concern has been mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  Applicant is a \njunior engineer who shows great potential and who is well respected by those she \nworks with.  She clearly understands the great responsibilities she has in holding a \nsecurity clearance. She has shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required of this privilege.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of September 24, 2019, Applicant owed four credit-card debts in collection for $6,367 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $6,344 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $929 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and $1,430 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and two loans charged off for $14,282 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $2,852 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted the debts, which he explained were incurred because of attorney fees for his divorce that was finalized in February 2009; travel expenses to see his son when his ex-wife had primary custody; child support for his son until July 2014 when he became the custodial parent; non-payment of child support by his ex-wife since July 2014; and a June 2018 apartment fire in which he lost everything. He indicated that he had taken care of some debts not alleged in the SOR, and that he was in the process of contacting his creditors to arrange repayment terms for the SOR debts, starting with the smallest debt.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/18/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant recently settled one past-due debt, but he still owes approximately $31,125 \nin delinquent credit-card debt. His divorce in February 2009 compromised his finances, and \nhe had to replace his belongings after a fire in June 2018, but he was not proactive about \naddressing his delinquencies. More progress is needed toward resolving his past-due \ndebts. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 15, 2019, Applicant submitted a detailed memorandum (Answer) with \nsubstantiating documentation in response to the SOR allegations, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On January 24, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nprepared to proceed to a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 29, 2020. On \nFebruary 3, 2020, I received the case file and scheduled a hearing for March 6, 2020. \n \nAt the hearing, seven Government exhibits (GEs 1-7) and 13 Applicant exhibits (AEs \nA-M) were admitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant and two co-workers \ntestified, as reflected in a hearing transcript received on March 17, 2020. \n \nOn April 28, 2020, without any objection from the Government, I re-opened the \nrecord for two weeks to give Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentary \nevidence. By the May 12, 2020 deadline, Applicant submitted five documents, which were \nadmitted without any objections as AEs N-R. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of September 24, 2019, Applicant owed \nfour credit-card debts in collection for $6,367 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $6,344 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $929 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e), and $1,430 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and two loans charged off for $14,282 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and \n$2,852 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted the debts, which he explained were incurred \nbecause of attorney fees for his divorce that was finalized in February 2009; travel \nexpenses to see his son when his ex-wife had primary custody; child support for his son \nuntil July 2014 when he became the custodial parent; non-payment of child support by his \nex-wife since July 2014; and a June 2018 apartment fire in which he lost everything. He \nindicated that he had taken care of some debts not alleged in the SOR, and that he was in \nthe process of contacting his creditors to arrange repayment terms for the SOR debts, \nstarting with the smallest debt. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR debts are accepted and incorporated as findings \nof fact. After considering the pleadings, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old task manager. He began working as an engineering \ntechnician for a defense contractor in March 2011. He became an employee of his current \nemployer in October 2014, when the company acquired the contract. He holds a DOD \nclearance, which he needs to maintain for his job. (GE 1; AE D; Tr. 14.) Applicant served \nhonorably on active duty in the United States Navy, holding either a secret or top secret \nclearance, from July 1999 to February 2011 when he was discharged at the rank of petty \nofficer second class (E-5) for failure to meet physical readiness standards. (AE H; Tr. 43.) \nHe earned an associate\u2019s degree in April 2011 and two bachelor\u2019s degrees in April 2012 \nand April 2013, respectively. (GE 1.)  \n\n3 \n \nApplicant mismanaged credit extended to him during his early years in the Navy. He \nobtained two credit cards on which he reached his credit limit. After making the monthly \nminimum payments on the cards for about a year, he stopped paying on them. At the \nurging of his then fianc\u00e9e in 2003, he contacted the entities pursuing him for collection and \nsettled in full a charged-off MasterCard account for $576 in March 2004 and a Visa account \nfor $339 in May 2005. He satisfied a $2,301 debt in collection for a computer in January \n2005. (GEs 2, 5-6.) Applicant did not report any delinquencies on his April 2005 security \nclearance application (SF 86) because he had paid or settled the debts, or in the case of a \n$2,013 debt on his credit record for testing materials and books, he disputed the debt \nbecause he did not receive all the materials ordered. (GEs 5-6.) On January 31, 2006, the \nDepartment of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON CAF) notified Applicant of its \nintent to deny him continued security clearance eligibility because of the delinquent \naccounts on his credit record and his failure to report them on his SF 86. (GE 5.) On \nFebruary 28, 2006, Applicant provided evidence of debt resolution for the Visa, \nMasterCard, and computer debts, and explained that he was in financial counseling. (GE \n6.) On April 10, 2006, the DON CAF granted Applicant a top secret clearance and eligibility \nfor access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI), but cautioned him that any future \nderogatory information, especially of a similar nature, would be cause for immediate \nreconsideration of the favorable security determination. (GE 7; Tr. 39, 47.) \n \nOn January 31, 2006, Applicant and his ex-wife married in October 2003, had a son \nin January 2004, and divorced in February 2009. (GE 1; AE F.) He moved into military \nbarracks on their separation in December 2007. (GE 1.) On their divorce, she became \nprimary custodial parent of their son. Applicant was required to pay child support at $168 \nper week and 51% of their son\u2019s daycare and medical expenses not reimbursed by \ninsurance. (AE F.) \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife had no joint bank deposits or other assets to divide. They \nretained individual responsibility for their own debts. Applicant retained possession of his \nvehicle, a 2004 model-year Jeep, purchased in October 2008 with a loan for $25,249 from \nthe credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (GE 4; AE F.) He also had some open credit-card accounts, \nincluding two accounts with a credit union opened in March 2008. He obtained a \nMasterCard (SOR \u00b6 1.b) with the credit union to pay his divorce attorney\u2019s fees of more \nthan $4,000 (Tr. 80-81) and \u201cinadvertently\u201d opened a VISA account (SOR \u00b6 1.a) at the \nsame time. He \u201cracked up\u201d debt on the credit cards, \u201cnot making the smartest decisions.\u201d \n(Tr. 36.) Shortly after his divorce was final, he obtained a $5,000 loan from the credit union \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) in March 2009 to cover the security deposit and purchase furnishings for an \napartment that he planned to share with his then girlfriend. After he paid the security \ndeposit, the plan fell through, and he rented an apartment on his own for the next year. \n(GEs 1, 4.) He used some of the loan money for living expenses, including food. (Tr. 61-\n64.) \n \nIn April 2010, Applicant relocated to another state for his military duties. For the next \nfew years, he incurred mileage, gasoline, and entertainment expenses to see his son one \nweekend each month. (GE 1; AEs F-G, J; Tr. 35.) Three credit-card debts became \nseriously delinquent during this time: a $2,022 debt from July 2010 (not alleged); an $8,200 \n\n4 \n \nmilitary exchange credit-card debt from December 2010 (not alleged); and a $1,125 debt \nfrom April 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (GEs 1, 4.) \n  \nOn his discharge from the military, Applicant began working for a defense contractor \nin March 2011, but his monthly income was about $1,600 less per month than what he had \nearned in the military. He continued to pay his child support and daycare obligations on \ntime at $375 every two weeks. (AEs J-K; Tr. 36.) \n \nBy early 2012, Applicant\u2019s Jeep was having mechanical difficulties. He tried to trade \nit in without success. In February 2012, he bought a 2006 model-year automobile with a \nloan for $15,375, and abandoned his Jeep at the roadside. (AE F; Tr. 57-63.) He made \ntimely payments for his new car (GE 4), but over the next three months, he stopped paying \non his four accounts with the credit union (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). He testified that he was told by \na car dealer to stop paying on the loan for the Jeep (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (Tr. 60.) As of July 2013, \nhis MasterCard and Visa accounts with the credit union were in collection for $6,367 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and $6,344 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). His vehicle and personal loans with the credit union were \ncharged off for $14,282 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $2,852 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), respectively. (GE 4; AE F.)  \nHe also owed credit-card collection balances to other creditors: $929 from May 2012 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e), $1,430 (placed for $1,125) from April 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $2,022 from July 2010 \n(not alleged). The $8,200 credit-card debt (not alleged) that had been seriously past due \nhad not been fully repaid. (GEs 1, 4.) \n \nIn late July 2014, Applicant became the primary custodial parent for his son. In a \npost-judgment decree, the court terminated Applicant\u2019s obligation to pay child support and \nordered his ex-wife to pay $30 per week in child support plus 38% of unreimbursed medical \nand daycare expenses for their son. (AE F; Tr. 37-38.) Applicant\u2019s ex-wife did not pay any \nchild support or reimburse Applicant for any of their son\u2019s medical expenses. (AE J; Tr. 69-\n70.) Their son, who has been diagnosed with bipolar I disorder, had therapy for almost two \nyears after Applicant became the primary custodial parent. (Tr. 67-70.) Applicant did not \nprovide any details about the extent of his co-payments for his son\u2019s care. \n \nIn October 2014, Applicant began working for his current employer. (GE 1.) On \nDecember 2, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SF 86 for his \nten-year update of his security clearance eligibility. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) In response to financial \nrecord inquiries concerning delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed three \ncredit-card debts of $2,021 ($2,022 in collection on his credit report, not alleged in SOR), \n$6,303 (debt originally $8,200, not alleged), and $929 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and two medical debts \nof $340 and $916 (not alleged). He did not list his four delinquent debts with the credit \nunion on his SF 86. Applicant cited his divorce and having primary custody of his son as the \nreasons for the debts. As for efforts to resolve the debts, Applicant stated with respect to \neach debt, \u201cCurrently developing long term goal to figure out a course of action to resolve \nthis debt.\u201d He explained that his tax refunds were taken and applied to the $8,200 credit-\ncard debt. (GE 1; Tr. 49.) The evidence shows that he fully resolved that debt in June 2018, \nin part by paying $400 a month from about September 2017 to June 2018. (GE 4; AE G; Tr. \n37, 49-50.) \n \n\n5 \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant bought a new car with a loan of $26,571, to be repaid \nat $489 per month. As of May 2019, he had not been late in any of his payments and had \npaid down the loan balance to $18,369. (GE 3.) \n \nAs of March 2017, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed no progress on the delinquent \naccounts in the SOR or on the $2,022 debt (not alleged). Applicant was making timely \npayments on two active credit-card accounts: an account held since December 2004 with a \ncurrent balance of $1,906, and an account held since April 2016 with a current balance of \n$1,445. (GE 4.) \n \nIn early June 2018, Applicant had a devastating fire in his apartment. He lost all of \nhis possessions, including his financial paperwork. (GE 2; AE J; Tr. 35-36.) He had renter\u2019s \ninsurance for $20,000. He filed a claim for $32,687 as the cost of replacement for his \nbelongings. The insurer discounted the value to $21,246 due to depreciation. He was paid \n$1,000 upfront and $19,000 when his claim was processed. (AE M; Tr. 35.) \n \nApplicant and his son lived in a hotel room after the fire. Applicant had insurance that \ncovered the difference between the rent he had paid for the apartment ($900 per month) \nand the cost of the hotel room. (Tr. 87.) He was unable to find an apartment for rent at less \nthan $1,400 a month, so in July 2018 he bought a home built in 1880 that had been \nrenovated. (AE J; Tr. 86.) He obtained a mortgage loan of $152,518 to be repaid at $1,169 \nper month. (GE 3; AE E.) On the advice of the mortgage company, some of the insurance \npayout from the fire went to reduce the balances on his active credit cards so that he would \nqualify for a mortgage. (Tr. 54-55.) About $2,600 of the insurance payout was used for the \ndown payment on his new home. (Tr. 84.) \n \n Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on September 21, 2018. He explained he began repaying the $8,200 \ncredit-card delinquency after he was notified that his wages were to be garnished, and the \ndebt was paid off in June 2018. He stated that he was paying off his smaller bills and \nworking to address his larger ones. He acknowledged a credit card delinquency of $1,430 \non the account in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He recognized the credit-union debts in SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.d as \nhis debts, but indicated that they had been written off. He could not provide any information \nabout the debts because he had not received any statements from the credit union in a \nlong time. He did not dispute the $929 debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e), but was unable to \nprovide any information about that debt. Applicant described his current credit as decent, \nciting his recent house purchase and improved budgeting. (GE 2.) \n \nOn April 8, 2019, Applicant was re-interviewed by the investigator. He stated that he \nwas \u201cplugging away\u201d at a $583 collection debt (not alleged) that, according to his March \n2017 credit report, had been placed for collection in October 2012. Applicant indicated that \nthe $2,022 credit card debt (not alleged) had been charged off in February 2014. He \nexplained that he was trying to save money to repay his debts. Applicant admitted the \ncredit-card delinquencies with the credit union (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) when confronted, and \nexpressed his belief they had been charged off. He attributed those delinquencies to his \ndivorce. (GE 2.) \n\n6 \n \nAs of June 2019, Equifax was reporting no delinquency trades on Applicant\u2019s credit \nrecord. The SOR delinquencies had been dropped from his credit record with no evidence \nof any payments. Applicant was making timely monthly payments of $1,169 on his \nmortgage; $489 on his December 2016 car loan; $206 on an unsecured loan obtained in \nMarch 2019 for $7,500; and on five active credit-card accounts with balances totaling \n$6,701, which required a total of $198 in monthly minimum payments. (GE 3.) His new \nhome needed a new oven, refrigerator, doors, microwave, and central air conditioning, \nsome or all of which he paid for with credit. (AE J.) He testified that the home also needed \nnew doors and new basement-support jacking posts. (Tr. 85.) \n \nApplicant continued to take on new credit as the delinquencies in the SOR went \nunresolved. In June 2019, he obtained a credit card with a $750 limit from a home-\nimprovement retailer. As of July 2019, the balance on that account was $375. In August \n2019, he opened a revolving charge account with a $500 credit limit with another creditor. \nAs of September 2019, the balance was $264. (AE E.) \n \nAfter his May 2019 annual review, Applicant was promoted at work to a task \nmanager and engineering technician 5 position. His hourly wage increased from $28 to \n$32. His take-home pay is now \u201ca little over $1,900\u201d every two weeks. (Tr. 44-45; 84.) He \nunderstands from his supervisor that he will no longer be employed if he does not retain \nsecurity clearance eligibility. (Tr. 46.) He received income tax refunds of approximately \n$200 each for tax years 2018 and 2019 because he did not claim his son as a dependent \non his returns. (Tr. 50-51.) His ex-wife claimed their son on her returns. (Tr. 52.) \n \nOn September 24, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of \nunresolved delinquencies on six accounts totaling $32,204. In his October 15, 2019 \nAnswer, Applicant cited those debts which had been resolved for his clearance in 2006 and \nthe $8,200 credit-card debt satisfied in June 2018 as evidence that he has the initiative and \nwillpower to pay his debts, \u201cgiven the proper time.\u201d He indicated that he had spoken with a \nfinancial advisor to discuss options to resolve his debts; that he was in the process of \ncontacting his creditors to work out payment plans, starting with the smallest debt first; and \nthat he was considering a second job for extra income, but \u201cit has been tough looking for \none that would work for [his] work schedule, [his] son\u2019s needs, and to be able to still \nfunction mentally.\u201d (Answer.) \n \nApplicant continued to make timely payments on his open accounts (his mortgage, \ncar loan, unsecured loan, and credit cards). As of January 2020, he had eight open credit \ncards with balances totaling $10,735, which was less than his credit limit of $12,350, but \nwith balances generally trending upward in recent months even with paying the monthly \nminimum or slightly more than the minimum on some accounts. (AE E; Tr. 79.) None of the \nthree credit reporting agencies reported any delinquencies on his credit record. (AE E.) \n \nIn December 2019, Applicant formulated a plan to resolve his debts. (Tr. 73.) In \nJanuary 2020, Applicant refinanced his car loan for $17,394, which lowered his monthly \npayment from $489 to $298. (AE C.) In mid-February 2020, Applicant refinanced his \nmortgage for more than the $150,755 he owed on his previous mortgage, but at a lower \n\n7 \n \ninterest rate than his previous loan. He was unable to recall the amount of his loan at his \nhearing. (AE A; Tr. 74, 78.) \n \nAs of his March 2020 hearing, Applicant had made no payments on any of the SOR \ndebts. (Tr. 38, 55-56.) He expressed his intent to contact his creditors and work out \npayment plans \u201conce things level out.\u201d (Tr. 38.) He planned to take the funds saved from \nlowering his mortgage and car payments and pay the SOR debts, starting with the smallest \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Tr. 64-65, 71.) As to why he had not made any arrangements with the credit \nunion to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, despite the fact that the debts had been \nbrought to his attention during his OPM interviews, Applicant responded: \n \nSo for those \u2014 I, being honest here, those were going to be later. I was \ngoing to take care of these smaller ones, first, once everything was \nadjudicated, the fire, the refinancing, and all that stuff, waiting on it leveling \nout. And every time I tried to do this, something comes up that costs, like, \n$500, $700, $750. (Tr. 53.) \n  \n \nApplicant decided against seeking a second job because of his son and instead \nchose to refinance his car and mortgage loans to lower his monthly payments. His first \npayment on his new mortgage was not due until April 1, 2020. He expected a refund of \nmore than $700 in escrow funds from his previous mortgage, and a check for the difference \nbetween his new loan and the $150,755 that went to satisfy his previous mortgage. (AE A; \nTr. 73.) He testified that with those funds, he would be able to satisfy the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.f, if not also the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Tr. 73-74.) \n \nAs of March 2020, he had $5 in his savings account and $1,400 in his checking \naccount. He \u201cessentially\u201d lives from paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 65-66.) He also indicated \nthat his son gets emotional and sometimes has suicidal thoughts, and so he gives him $20 \nhere and there. (Tr. 67.) When asked for assurances that he would move forward and take \ncare of his debts, Applicant admitted that he had not acted as he should have but that \nsome of his co-workers know about the issue and \u201cthey have kept [him], try to keep the fire, \nfor a lack of better term, underneath [his] butt.\u201d (Tr. 72.) \n \nOn April 24, 2020, I informed Applicant that I would consider re-opening the record \nat his request to provide him an opportunity to supplement the record. There being no \nobjections from the Government, on April 28, 2020, I re-opened the record for post-hearing \nsubmissions at Applicant\u2019s request. Applicant was given a May 12, 2020 deadline. \n \nOn April 29, 2020, a collection entity for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e notified Applicant that \nit would settle his $929 balance for $557 payable in five installments starting May 29, 2020. \n(AE Q.) On May 7, 2020, Applicant paid $557 and the debt was settled in full. (AEs O, P, \nR.) \n \nOn May 8, 2020, Applicant began making payments of $150 a month to the credit \nunion toward resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. (AE N, P.) It is unclear how the credit \n\n8 \n \nunion plans to apply those payments; whether the credit union is willing to settle for less \nthan the full balances owed on the four accounts; or when the debts will be resolved. \n \nWork Performance \n \n \nEvaluation Report and Counseling Records for his military performance from August \n2004 to February 2011 reflect that Applicant was a hardworking and dedicated sailor with a \nflexible leadership style and positive attitude. He was often rated as a must promote or \nearly promote despite having failed three physical fitness assessments in a four-year \nperiod. He sought increased responsibilities and routinely greatly exceeded standards in \nterms of professional knowledge. His military evaluation on his discharge shows that he \nremained productive and knowledgeable, needed minimal supervision, and showed \ntremendous initiative. He wanted to stay in the Navy, but he could not meet the physical \nreadiness standards. (AE D; Tr. 43.) Applicant received several commendations while in \nthe Navy for his duty performance between June 2000 and June 2006. He was awarded \nthe Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal for his achievements from February 2006 \nto June 2006. \n \n \nAs s defense contractor employee, Applicant received a letter of commendation from \nthe Navy in January 2013 for being instrumental in overhauling planned maintenance \nprocedures for a submarine sonar system. He was lauded for his positive mental attitude, \nexpert knowledge, and dogged attention to detail. (AE I.) At his annual review in January \n2013, Applicant was given the highest rating in several categories and recommended for \nimmediate promotion. (AE D.) In February 2013, his then employer recognized his \noutstanding performance with an award of excellence. (AE I.) \n \n \nApplicant displayed similar dedication in his work for his current employer, who \nrecognized his professionalism and contributions in April 2016 and June 2019. In June \n2019, he received a $100 cash award from his employer for an outstanding job as a quality \nassurance reviewer on a successful task that \u201ccast a shining beacon on the work and ability \nof [his employer] to get the job done.\u201d (AE I.) Additionally, Applicant received several emails \nin his current job from co-workers and his company\u2019s military customer commenting \nfavorably about his consistently high level of service and hard work. (AE B.) His annual \nperformance appraisals since he began his current employment show that he is held in high \nregard for his initiative, job knowledge, leadership on the job, quality of his work, and \nteamwork. He has consistently exceeded his employer\u2019s expectations and is considered a \nmajor contributor. As a task manager since 2017, he has significantly exceeded \nrequirements as to performing his tasks in a time and cost-saving manner, handling extra \nassignments, and contributing to positive customer relations. He requires little supervision. \n(AE D.) \n \n \nIn October 2015, in late July 2016, and in December 2019, Applicant notified his \nemployer of possible spillage of a classified drawing onto his workstation. In all instances, \nthe document was determined to be unclassified but bore improper or unclear markings. \n(AE L.) \n \n\n9 \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s co-workers testified on his behalf. A co-worker on the technical \nengineering side of their workgroup has known Applicant since January 2016. He now \nworks for the primary contractor who took over the contract in December 2019. While \nApplicant\u2019s employer is now a \u201cminority partner,\u201d this co-worker and Applicant continue to \nwork together. He attests that Applicant is very professional and a hard worker, including in \nhis role on the recreation and morale committee at work. This co-worker knows little of the \ndetails of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, but he understands that Applicant is a single \nparent, had a fire, and purchased a new home. He believes Applicant will pay off his \noutstanding debts based on the responsible behavior he has demonstrated at work. He \nopined that Applicant has \u201ca bright future\u201d if he can keep his clearance. (Tr. 89-94.) \n \n  \nA project manager, who signed off on Applicant\u2019s most recent performance \nevaluations as a second-level supervisor, testified that Applicant has proven his capabilities \nover and over. Applicant is trusted by their government customer and upper management. \nThis supervisor is aware that Applicant has had some financial difficulties, caused in part by \nhis apartment fire and other circumstances not his fault. Applicant\u2019s financial issues first \ncame to the manager\u2019s attention some time ago when a garnishment issue arose. He is \naware that Applicant has also had to deal with issues involving his son, who lost two of his \nbest friends to suicide in the last couple of years. Despite these struggles, Applicant gives \nhis best effort every day. The supervisor believes Applicant is \u201con the right track\u201d by \nrefinancing his mortgage and car loans to free up funds so that he can pay his old debts. \nHe believes Applicant will be able to resolve the debts over time. In this supervisor\u2019s \nopinion, should Applicant lose his security clearance, it would damage the company and \ntheir government customer who rely on his expertise. He considers Applicant to be one of \nhis best technicians, if not the best, and attests that Applicant\u2019s handling of classified \ninformation is above reproach. He does not think Applicant is a security risk. (Tr. 98-108, \n113.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n10 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \n\n11 \n \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a nexus \nbetween proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. The evidence is undisputed that Applicant \ndefaulted on the accounts in the SOR. He abandoned the vehicle purchased with the loan \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c and then stopped paying on the loan. He claims he was at the advice of a car \ndealer who would not take the vehicle in trade. In addition to the SOR delinquencies \ntotaling $32,204, he became seriously delinquent on some other financial obligations, \nincluding credit-card debts for $8,200 and $2,022, which were not alleged in the SOR. \nDebts not alleged in the SOR cannot be considered for disqualifying purposes, but they \nshow that his financial problems were more extensive than the SOR indicates. However, \nthey may be relevant in assessing other issues, such as reform. In that regard, the \nevidence shows he paid off the $8,200 with a final payment in June 2018, albeit apparently \nafter he was told that his wages would be subject to garnishment for the debt. \n \nThe defaulted loans with the credit union (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) have been written off, \nand there is no evidence he has been pursued for collection. As of a credit check in June \n2019, none of the delinquencies alleged in the SOR were still on his credit record. The Fair \nCredit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report \nseven years from the first date of delinquency or if they become no longer legally collectible \nbecause of a state statute of limitations, which is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. \nDebts may also be dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the \ndebt is not going to be paid or when the debt has been charged off. Even so, debts may still \nhave security significance if they are no longer legally collectible or have been dropped \nfrom a credit record, particularly if they resulted from financially irresponsible behavior or \nremain unaddressed without reasonable justification. Applicant admits that he did not make \nthe smartest decisions when he ran up the credit-card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Even \nassuming that he acted on the advice of a car dealer, it was irresponsible of him to \nabandon his Jeep at the roadside and stop paying on his loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under AG \u00b6 19, \ndisqualifying conditions 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts, and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d are fully established. Regarding AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d warrants some consideration because of his years \nof inattention to the debts in the SOR. Yet he has professed his intent to repay the debts in \nthe SOR. He took some steps, albeit months after the SOR was issued, to free up some \nincome so that he can make some payments toward the long overdue $32,204 of debt of \nconcern to the DOD, and he settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $557 on May 7, 2020, which \nshows some willingness to repay his debts. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \n\n12 \n \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. One \nor more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts in the SOR became seriously delinquent more than \nfive years ago. Nonetheless, Applicant\u2019s debts are considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n  \n \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). His divorce caused or \ncontributed to his financial problems in several aspects. Some $4,000 of the $6,344 credit-\ncard debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) went to pay his divorce attorney. He paid child support at $168 a \nweek from February 2009 through July 2014, when he acquired primary custody of his son. \nApplicant has not received any child support from his ex-wife, which has been court-\nordered at $30 a week since July 2014. From 2014 to 2016, Applicant incurred therapy \ncosts for his son, although he did not elaborate as to the extent of those costs. More \nrecently, his financial situation was impacted by his apartment fire in early June 2018 in \nwhich he and his son lost much of their belongings. He recouped $20,000 of his loss \nthrough insurance but estimates that he suffered unreimbursed losses totaling \napproximately $12,000 in the fire.  \n \n \nEven when factors outside of his control contributed to or caused his financial \nproblems, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible manner when \ndealing with his financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, \n2005)). Applicant\u2019s evidence in this regard falls considerably short. He did not maintain \n\n13 \n \ncontact with his creditors identified in the SOR, and could not provide much information \nabout his debts when interviewed by the OPM investigator. He certainly knew that he had \nobtained the loans and credit cards from the credit union, but assumed they had all been \nwritten off and so did nothing about them. Applicant knew or should have known after his \nOPM interview in September 2018 that the adverse entries then on his credit record were \nof concern to the DOD. He continued to take on new debt, including a $7,500 loan in March \n2009 and credit-card debts, while the delinquencies in the SOR went unaddressed. In June \n2019, he obtained a credit card with a $750 limit with a home-improvement retailer. As of \nJuly 2019, the balance was $375. In August 2019, he opened a revolving charge account \nwith a $500 credit limit with another creditor. As of September 2019, the balance was $264. \nIt was not until December 2019 that Applicant established a plan to resolve his debts. Over \nthe next two months, he refinanced his car and mortgage loans to free up funds that he \ncould put toward his longstanding past-due balances. As of his March 2020 hearing, he had \nnot contacted the creditors in the SOR to arrange for settlements or repayment terms. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s resolution of some credit-card delinquencies more than a decade ago \nwhen he was in the military carries little weight in demonstrating current good faith with \nrespect to resolving the SOR debts. His resolution of the $8,200 credit-card debt with a final \npayment in June 2018 warrants some consideration with respect to mitigating conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). The Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. There is no \nrequirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debt simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, the $8,200 debt was resolved in part \nthrough application of his tax refunds and payments after being notified that the creditor \nintended to garnish his wages. It was not pursuant to any established plan that would have \nled to resolution of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s refinancing of his mortgage and car loans in \nearly 2020 are significant first steps in implementation of a plan, but it is concerning that \nApplicant did not make any payments on any of the debts in the SOR before May 2020. \nThe Government could reasonably expect that Applicant, who held security clearance \neligibility knowing that financial problems would cause reconsideration of his security \nclearance, would have given more priority to addressing the issues of security concern. \nApplicant would have had a stronger case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) \nhad he been able to show that he made some efforts to repay his debts before his hearing, \nor at least shortly thereafter. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that \u201can applicant who \nwaits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts might be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 15-\n03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). \n \nAs of his March 6, 2020 hearing, Applicant expected to be refunded approximately \n$700 in escrow funds and to receive a payout of mortgage funds because his current \nmortgage is higher than his previous mortgage. It is unclear when or even if he received \nthese funds. He settled the $929 credit-card delinquency for $557 on May 7, 2020, and a \nfavorable finding is warranted as to SOR \u00b6 1.e on that basis. However, the timing of that \npayment, and of his $150 payment to the credit union toward the debts SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, \nsuggests that he might not have acted had I not informed him that I would consider post-\n\n14 \n \nhearing submissions. Applicant now has a repayment plan with the credit union, but a first \npayment is not enough to demonstrate a track record from which I could reasonably \nconclude that he will give priority to repaying these debts. The Appeal Board has held that a \npromise to pay a debt in the future is not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05390 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010). Applicant \nhas been making timely payments on his open credit-card and loan accounts, but his \nJanuary 2020 credit report also shows an upward trend in his outstanding credit-card \nbalances, which is concerning with respect to his financial stability and judgment. More \nprogress is needed toward resolving his financial situation. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nBy all accounts, Applicant has been an excellent performer at work. He exhibited an \nattentiveness to security issues, bringing his employer\u2019s attention to instances where he \nsuspected a spillage of classified material. A security clearance decision is a risk \nassessment about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment with regard to \nwhether he or she can be relied on to appropriately handle and safeguard classified \ninformation. It is not a debt-collection procedure. At the same time, Applicant had been \ncautioned when his clearance eligibility was continued in 2006 that any future issues, \nespecially of a financial nature, would be grounds for immediate reconsideration of his \nsecurity clearance. He was on notice of the importance of fulfilling his financial \ncommitments if he wanted to retain his security clearance. While his divorce in February \n2009, the June 2018 fire, and other circumstances negatively impacted his finances, the \nGovernment could reasonably expect Applicant to have been more diligent in attempting to \nresolve the SOR debts. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After \napplying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence presented, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n\n15 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He \nsaid he was aware of the bad decisions he made in his life, and was willing to take any \nsteps necessary to correct them.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a personal loan in which Applicant could not negotiate a settlement \nor payment plan. The debt remains unresolved. SOR \u00b6 1.b is a loan on a vehicle that was \nrepossessed in 2016 for late payments. He has not made contact with the creditor and \nthe debt remains unresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.f and are loans and credit-card debts in which \nApplicant was unable to settle or pay. The debts remain unresolved. SOR 1.i is a medical \naccount. Applicant admitted the debt but said he was never contacted by the provider. It \nremains unpaid.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j and \u00b6 1.l are duplicate entries. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j through 1.m are utility and \nphone charges that Applicant was unable to settle and remain unresolved. SOR \u00b6 1.g is \na credit-card debt on which Applicant stated he has been making payments of $60 per \nmonth since September 2019.  \n \nApplicant testified that now that he is married, his spouse works and helps with \ntheir finances. He attended financial counseling in October 2019 on post, and he is looking \nfor ways to eliminate unnecessary expenses, reduce spending, and to arrange payment \nplans. He has about $1,000 in savings and about $200 per month remaining after paying \nexpenses. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n\n \n4 \n \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that remain unresolved. The \ndebts appear to have resulted from a period of unemployment after he left active duty, \nand from irresponsible financial practices. Except for SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant has not shown \nsufficient efforts to resolve delinquent debts. Despite receiving financial counseling, he \nhas not shown that he is willing or able to resolve debts he incurred before he married. \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s financial status raises significant doubts about his financial \nmanagement decisions, personal responsibility, and ability to address delinquent debts. I \nam not convinced Applicant makes good financial decisions, and his financial status \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. No \nmitigation conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and employment history. However, I remain unconvinced of \nhis financial responsibility and ability to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.f, 1h - 1.k; and 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 23, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), and Administrative Guidelines (AG) implemented on June 8, 2017, the \nDepartment of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed Applicant that, \nbased on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge.  The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2020. The Defense Office of \nAdministrative Hearings (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 15, 2020, \nscheduling the hearing for February 7, 2020. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 7, which were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified in her \nown behalf, presented one witness and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were \nmarked and admitted into the record without objection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I held the \n\n \n2 \n \nrecord open until January 28, 2020, for additional information. The transcript was received \non January 23, 2020. The record closed on February 28, 2020. Applicant submitted \nadditional documentation, AE D and E, which was admitted into the record without \nobjection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 45, is divorced, remarried in 2011 and has six children. She \ngraduated from high school in 1992 and has taken college courses for several years but \nhas not yet obtained her undergraduate degree. Applicant completed her security \nclearance application on February 9, 2018. She has held a security clearance since 2007. \nShe has been employed as a contractor since 2003. She has been employed with her \ncurrent employer since 2015 as a program analyst. (GE 1) \n  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has nine delinquents totaling approximately \n$38,000.  Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with the exception of 1.a, and 1.c. and \nprovided explanations. She did not believe the amount of the debt was accurate for 1.a \nand 1.c. \n \nApplicant acknowledged her financial problems and her delinquent debts although \nshe disagreed with the amounts. She attributed them to raising her three children as a \nsingle mother for many years. She also stated that she was a victim of identity theft and \nthat higher prices in health insurance in 2015, have contributed to her financial instability. \nHowever, she was adamant that given her stellar government career and various \npromotions, she should not be judged by how her finances appear. (Tr.18) She presented \nevidence that she just received a promotion. (AE B) She is adamant that this is a financial \nlapse of judgment in her obligations but does not undermine her 20 years of excellent \nservice to the Government. (Tr.81) She stated that she has never had a security violation \nand would never sell U.S. secrets. She claims that she is very reliable. \n \nApplicant also stated that at one point she moved to another state to live with her \nsister so that she could save money. She lived there for about six months, but returned \nand had difficulty finding a place for her and her three children to live due to expensive \nrent. She kept delaying financial counseling because she \u201cwanted to get her credit \nstraight.\u201d She has recently set up a meeting to obtain financial counseling. (Tr. 39, AE A) \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR allegation 1.a, a charged-off account in the \namount of $17,008, because it was the result of a van that burned and was a total loss. \nApplicant purchased the vehicle in 2014 and in 2018 the insurance company evaluated it \nas a total loss and settled. Applicant avers that a payment of $8,360 was sent to this \naccount and she believes the charge-off amount is not $17,008.  (Tr. 21) However, she \ndid not produce any evidence to confirm her assertion. Her credit report confirms that she \nowes $17,008. (GE 2, 3)  \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.b, a charged-off account in the amount of $12,699, \nApplicant stopped making payment in March 2017 because she could no longer afford \n\n \n3 \n \nthem. This was a car loan and Applicant had been making payments of $20 a month. The \ncar was repossessed. (Tr. 25) \n \nSOR allegation 1.c, a collection account in the amount of $613, Applicant denied \nthe allegation, but stated that she has never made any payments on the account, which \nwas opened in 2016. She believes this is a duplicate of 1.e. \n \nSOR allegation 1.d, a collection account in the amount of $600 was related to items \nin an apartment in 2014. Applicant has not taken any steps to resolve this account. (Tr.28) \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.e, a charged-off account in the amount of $553, a last \npayment was made in 2015. It is not resolved. (Tr. 28) \n \nAs to SOR allegation 1.f, a collection account in the amount of $471, this credit \ncard became delinquent in 2014 and is not resolved. (Tr. 28) \n \nSOR allegation 1.g, is a credit card in collection for $435 that went to collection in \n2019, but the last payment was in 2017. This is not resolved. \n \nSOR allegation 1.h, is a charged-off account in the amount of $5,629. The account \nwas for furniture that was bought and not paid for. (Tr. 48) Applicant has not attempted to \nresolve this account but stated that she is going to set up credit counseling so that she \ncould set up a payment plan. (Tr. 29) The account is unresolved. \n \nSOR allegation 1.i is a charged-off credit account in the amount of $129. The card \nwas charged off in 2012. Applicant has not made any efforts to address this account. (Tr. \n30)  \n \nAt the hearing, the SOR was amended to include an SOR allegation 1.j, to reflect \nthat Applicant has not timely filed her 2018 income tax returns for both Federal and state. \n(Tr. 43) She has not requested an extension and admitted that she had no good reason \nfor not filing. She stated that she just hasn\u2019t made time to file. (Tr.42) \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband who she married in 2011, earns about $25 an hour. (Tr. 67) \nHe worked as an Uber driver and related how he had an accident in 2009 involving the \nissue alleged in SOR 1.a. The vehicle was totaled. In 2011 and 2012 two other vehicles \nwere purchased. Applicant\u2019s husband lost the Uber job in 2016, and they could not keep \nup with the payments. He blames himself for these issues. (Tr.47) However, he believes \nthe correct amount should be $7,000 or $8,000. Neither Applicant nor her husband has \nany documentation to confirm the assertions. (Tr. 56) \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband also invested in a food truck for his wife. He took out a loan \nfor $10,000 in his name and was making monthly payments of $246.  However, the food \ntruck has not passed all the regulatory inspections or licensing requirements and the truck \nis just sitting. Applicant is not able to make the payments on the loan. Thus, Applicant \ncan\u2019t use it to generate extra income. Her husband stated that he did not understand the \n\n4 \nseverity of the matter regarding his wife\u2019s security clearance.  Her husband pointed out \nthat Applicant is paying college tuition for one child.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2018 subject interview, she explained that she and her husband took \na five day cruise to the Bahamas (Tr. 38).  She had other debts that were resolved by \ngarnishment or she has paid as required. (GE 7) She affirmed, however, that none of the \ndebts listed on the SOR have been paid or are in a payment plan. (Tr.75) Her husband \ntook out a $10,000 loan for the food truck in 2018 when they already had delinquent debts. \nApplicant currently earns about $75,000 a year and she has been consistently \nemployed.  She has not had any financial counseling, but has made an appointment. She \nhas a budget. It is not clear what the monthly net remainder is in her budget.  \nApplicant submitted as post-hearing documentation letters from an insurance \ncompany concerning the amount owed in SOR allegation 1.a , but does not state that \nthere is no balance owing. (AE D, E) She stated in her post-hearing statement that she \nhas started financial counseling. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d), and AG 19(f) (\u201c failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \n\n \n6 \n \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant admitted that she had no good reason for not filing her Federal and state \nincome tax returns. There does not appear to be any circumstance that occurred beyond \nher control with the exception of the car accident and her husband losing the Uber job \nShe has been consistently employed. She has not paid or resolved any of the SOR \ndelinquent debts. She just recently obtained financial counseling. She is now seeking a \npayment arrangement. She and her husband took a cruise when they should have been \naddressing the delinquent debts and the college tuition for one child. \n \n Applicant\u2019s husband stated that he did not take this financial issue seriously and \ndid not understand that it would impact his wife\u2019s security clearance. Applicant believes \ndue to her exemplary 20 years of Government service, her financial obligations should \nnot be undermining her trustworthiness or reliability to continue with her security \nclearance. Without documentary evidence of more efforts, she has not demonstrated a \ntrack record and there is no indication that her financial situation is under control. AG \u00b6 \n20(a)-20(d) and 20(g) are not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain \nunresolved. Although she promises to address them in the future, promises to pay are \nnot given weight in the security clearance process. She has not expressed her intent \nconcerning her 2018 tax filings. She has not met her burden of proof in this case. For \nthese reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j. against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \n\n \n7 \n \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s excellent work career and recent promotion; her \nfailure to file as required her 2018 Federal and state income tax returns or have any track \nrecord of payments, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her financial indebtedness. I conclude that it is not in the national interest to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

This \nallegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has very significant past-due indebtedness totaling about $30,686. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute her financial difficulties to periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, these financial problems are ongoing. She has a \nlong history of delinquencies. Applicant has not demonstrated that future financial \nproblems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. Financial \nConsiderations is found against Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.q: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Tr. \n6, 17-20; GE 1, 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 18 student loans in collection status totaling \n$47,966. The debts were listed on a credit report from January 2019. (GE 4)  \n \n \nApplicant incurred student-loan debt while attending technical school to receive \nhis associate\u2019s degree from 2005-2007. The school he attended ultimately went out of \nbusiness. He credibly testified that seven of the delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.g) were transferred or sold to a collection agent (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l-1.r). He has been making \napproximately $500 monthly payments through wage garnishment since approximately \nlate 2016. While Applicant did not provide documentation showing the transfer or sale of \nthe student loans, he provided copies of his bi-monthly earnings statement starting in \nFebruary 2017 (this was as far back as his company\u2019s records could go) through August \n2017, and from August 2019 through February 2020, which corroborate his student loan \npayments (I told Applicant to provide a representative sampling of his earnings \nstatements to include six months showing the start of his payments and six months from \nthe present time, which he did. He was not asked to provide statements for the entire \ntime period). (Tr. 19-25; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the amount of his original student loans was \napproximately $32,000. He provided documentation showing that his current balance is \napproximately $16,700. Applicant admitted having a sporadic student-loan payment \nhistory before the garnishment order in 2016. The reasons for his interrupted payments \nincluded periods of unemployment and trying to provide for his two minor children as the \nsole income provider. After the garnishment order, Applicant did not receive any \ncorrespondence from any creditors or collection services about his student loans. Four \nstudent loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.k) are shown on the Government\u2019s most recent credit \nreport as assigned to a government collection account. (Tr. 25-27; GE 5; AE A-B) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant indicated that his current financial status is much improved. He is \ncurrently living with and caring for his elderly mother who owns her home, thus negating \nany rent for Applicant.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nApplicant became delinquent on his student loans. I find both the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; (c) the individual \n\n \n5 \n \nhas received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control;    \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant incurred student loans from 2005-2007. They became delinquent when \nhe could not make his payments because of unemployment and providing for his \nchildren. At some point, a successor collection agency acquired his student loans and \nreceived a garnishment order in late 2016. Since that time, Applicant\u2019s pay has been \ngarnished in the amount of approximately $500 monthly. While a garnishment is not a \nvoluntary good-faith payment by Applicant, these payments are reducing his student \nloans and otherwise resolving his debt. His unemployment and family circumstances \nwere conditions beyond his control, but he did not act responsibly by allowing his \nstudent loans to go into collection status and require enforcement of payment through a \nwage garnishment. While the credit reports are confusing as to the actual status of all \nhis student loans (because of transfers, sales and changing account numbers), \nsubstantial evidence exists to conclude that Applicant\u2019s student loans are being paid by \nthe wage garnishment. He lives within his means and is now current on all his other \nfinancial obligations. All the above mitigating conditions have some applicability. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n\n \n6 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, his unemployment, and the circumstances \nsurrounding his indebtedness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 23, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 \n(AG). \n \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on September 27, 2019, and he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 21, 2019, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on December 19, 2019. The Government offered \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list was identified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and \noffered one exhibit (AE A), which was admitted without objection. The record remained \nopen until January 17, 2020, to allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He \nsubmitted AE B through D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on December 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations, and his admissions \nare incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job as a communications security manager in July 2018. He holds a \nbachelor\u2019s and two associate\u2019s degrees. He served in the U.S. Army from 2009 to 2013. \nHe deployed to Iraq for a year and received an Army Commendation Medal for his \nservice there. He was an intelligence analyst and held a top secret clearance at that \ntime. He separated with an honorable discharge as a specialist (E-4). He married in \n2012, and he has two children. (Tr. 5, 21, 23; Answer; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had four charged-off debts and one collection \ndebt totaling approximately $14,745. The SOR went on to allege six private student \nloans in collection status totaling $31,738. The debts were listed on credit reports from \nJanuary 2019, July 2019, and December 2019.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that six of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.l) were from \ndelinquent private student loans he took out to help pay for college in 2005 to 2007, \nbefore he joined the Army. Because of his academic standing, he was required to use \nprivate student loans to pay for college. He accumulated approximately $65,000 worth \nof student loans. He realized that he could never pay these loans with the college \ndegree he had chosen. He joined the Army and paid his student loans directly from his \npaycheck, reducing the overall balance to approximately $30,000. His payment \nassertions are corroborated by his January 2010 credit report that showed the student \nloans in good standing. These student loans went into delinquent status after \nApplicant\u2019s discharge, during his unemployment, and after his deferments expired. \nNone of these private student loans appear on Applicant\u2019s two most recent credit \nreports contained in the record. (Tr. 24, 27-29; Answer; GE 3, 7-8) \n \n \nAfter his honorable service in the Army, Applicant believed his background as an \nintelligence analyst put him in a good position to obtain a civilian contractor position. \nThis was not the case, and he struggled to provide for his family during extended \nperiods of unemployment (July 2013-September 2015; January 2016-March 2016; \nOctober 2016-May 2017; May 2018-July2018) and part-time employment (September \n2015-January 2016; January 2018-May 2018). He went back to college and obtained \nhis bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014 using his GI-Bill benefits and securing federal student \nloans. He also earned two associate\u2019s degrees. (Tr. 21-23) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant established two lines of credit from banks while in the Army in an effort \nto establish a good credit resume and raise his credit score. While on active duty he \nborrowed against the credit lines and then repaid them. When he was discharged and \nbecame unemployed, he was unable to continue his payments on these credit lines. \nThis resulted in the charged-off debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b and 1.d-1.e. Applicant \ncredibly testified that he has attempted to negotiate payment plans with the two banks, \nbut they only will accept lump-sum payments, which Applicant is unable to afford. He \nintends to pay these credit lines when he accumulates the needed finances to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s payment plan includes using the approximately $7,000 bonus he will receive \nshortly and his 2019 federal income tax refund, which he expects to be approximately \n$10,000 to pay the outstanding credit lines, as well as the deficiency balance on an auto \nrepossession (SOR \u00b6 1.c).  Applicant\u2019s current annual salary is approximately $75,000. \nHe is current on his rent and both of his older model vehicles are paid. His wife works \npart time, but mostly provides child care for their two young children, which would \notherwise cost approximately $1,900 monthly. Applicant provided a reference number \nindicating his payment of the consumer debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.f. (Tr. 23-25, 35, 37-40; \nAnswer; AE D)   \n \n \nApplicant documented his regular payments on his federal student loans, which \nhe incurred while completing his bachelor\u2019s and associates\u2019 degrees. He intends to \ncontinue making these student-loan payments. (Tr. 34, 42; AE B-C) \n \n \nApplicant provided letters of support from his former supervisor, who was also \nthe former facility security officer (FSO), and his current supervisor, who is the current \nFSO. Both have the highest regard for Applicant. Applicant disclosed his financial \ndifficulties to both people and they believe he is on his way to financial recovery. \nApplicant is characterized as a trusted team member who is totally reliable. His former \nsupervisor recommended the retention of Applicant\u2019s clearance. (Answer) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nApplicant had a number of delinquent debts. I find both the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s incurred private student loans in 2005-2007, before he joined the \nArmy that he paid while in the Army. They became delinquent after his discharge and \nsubsequent unemployment. These were conditions beyond his control and he acted \nresponsibly by attempting to negotiate settlements with his creditors, but they refused \nanything other than lump-sum payments. The private student loans no longer appear on \nhis credit report. Applicant plans on using his employment bonus and his expected \nfederal tax refund to pay his remaining debts. He paid one SOR debt and is current on \nhis federal student loans. Since obtaining his current job 18 months ago, he has started \nhis financial recovery. He lives within his means and is now current on all his other \nfinancial obligations. All the above mitigating conditions have some applicability. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployment to Iraq, his \nunemployment, and the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is employed by a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. He also incurred delinquent debt owed to two separate creditors on accounts that were past due or placed in collection totaling in excess of $40,000. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the debts listed in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated October 17, 2017, confirms this indebtedness. (Government Exhibit 6.) Applicant served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from 1995 through 1999 and with the Navy from 2000 from 2012. Applicant was discharged from the Navy with only ten days of notice because he was unable to pass the required physical fitness test. Applicant stated that he cashed out his Navy retirement account in the amount of $21,000, and used the severance pay he received in the amount of $13,695 for living expenses.

He has a bachelor\u2019s degree and military \ntraining.  He is employed by a defense contractor and is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017.  He also incurred delinquent debt owed \nto two separate creditors on accounts that were past due or placed in collection totaling \nin excess of $40,000.  In his answer, Applicant admits each of the debts listed in the \nSOR.  Applicant\u2019s credit report dated October 17, 2017, confirms this indebtedness.  \n(Government Exhibit 6.)   \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Marine Corps from 1995 \nthrough 1999 and with the Navy from 2000 from 2012.  Applicant was discharged from \nthe Navy with only ten days of notice because he was unable to pass the required \nphysical fitness test.  Applicant stated that he cashed out his Navy retirement account in \nthe amount of $21,000, and used the severance pay he received in the amount of \n$13,695 for living expenses.  Following his military discharge, he was unemployed for \napproximately four years.  Applicant lived with his wife (a Japanese permanent resident) \nin Japan.  He states that he was supported by his wife, GI Bill Benefits, and student \nloans, as he attended college online to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree.  Since July 2016, \nApplicant has been working on a full-time basis.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  In his security \nclearance application dated July 2017, Applicant indicated that he was at that time \nseeking financial counseling.  (Government Exhibit 4, p. 34.)   \n \nDuring his personal subject interview in June 2019, as part of his security \nclearance background investigation, Applicant explained that after being discharged \nfrom the military he did not have a plan for employment.  He and his spouse used all of \ntheir funds to pay rent, utilities, buy food and day to day expenses.  He states that he \ndid not intentionally stop paying on his accounts, he simply could not afford to pay them.    \nApplicant also explained to the investigator that he failed to file his Federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017, because as a single filer, he could not afford to pay \nthe $400 he estimated in taxes.  He stated that he planned to file and pay all taxes in full \n\n \n3 \n \nby July 2020.  He further stated that he has no intention of failing to file his income tax \nreturns or paying his Federal taxes in the future.  (Government Exhibit 5.)    \n \nIn regard to his delinquent debt, Applicant opened up several lines of credit that \nhe has not paid.  He currently owes the Navy Federal Credit Union for a number of \ndelinquent accounts, they include a personal loan and several credit cards totaling in \nexcess of $40,000.  He states that he used this money to pay rent, buy food, gas and \npay day to day living expenses.  He stated that he plans to pay these accounts by June \n2024.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  \n \nApplicant also admitted that he owes a jewelry store approximately $3,026.  At \nthe time the SOR was issued, he was approximately $1,080 past due.  (Government \nExhibit 3.)  He explained that he purchased a wedding ring for his spouse.  He states \nthat he will pay this account by June 2024.  As of June 2019, the date of the report of \nthe personal subject interview of Applicant, Applicant had not received any type of \nfinancial counseling.  (Government Exhibit 5.) \n \n \n  The following delinquent debts in the SOR remain owing and are of security \nconcern: \n \nb. A delinquent debt owed to a jewelry store is past due in the amount of $1,080 \nwith a total balance of $3,026.  Applicant admits the debt.  (Government Exhibit \n3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that he has addressed \nthe debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing.   \n \nc. A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $5,272.  Applicant admits the debt.  (Government Exhibit \n3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that he has addressed \nthe debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing.   \n \nd.  A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $10,474.  Applicant admits the debt.  (Government \nExhibit 3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that he has \naddressed the debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing.    \n \ne.  A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $7,787.  Applicant admits the debt.  (Government Exhibit \n3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that he has addressed \nthe debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing.  \n \nf.  A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of approximately $5,683.  Applicant admits the debt.  \n(Government Exhibit 3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show \nthat he has addressed the debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing.     \n \ng.  A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $10,598.  Applicant admits the debt.  (Government \n\n \n4 \n \nExhibit 3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that he has \naddressed the debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing. \n \nh.  A delinquent debt owed to a credit union was placed for collection in the \napproximate amount of $1,503.  Applicant admits the debt.  (Government Exhibit \n3.)  Applicant provided no documentary evidence to show that he has addressed \nthe debt in any fashion.  The debt remains owing. \n \n      It is noted that the debts set forth above do not appear on Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent credit report.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Under the particular circumstances of this \ncase, their absence from the credit report is not affirmative evidence that the debts have \nbeen resolved.  According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, in some cases, derogatory \naccounts may fall off of the credit reports after seven years.  This does not mean that \nthe debt is no longer owing.    \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f)  failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies dating back to at least 2012.  \nHe opened up several lines of credit that he has not paid since 2012-2013.  Today, he \nstill owes this debt and remains excessively indebted.  There is insufficient information \nin the record to conclude that he is financially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, \nor that he has the financial resources available to pay his financial obligations.  There is \nno evidence in the record to show that any regular monthly payments of any sort are \nbeing made toward his debts.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nIt is noted that Applicant was released from military service under sudden and \nunexpected circumstances.  This situation was beyond his control and contributed to his \nfinancial difficulties.  Following this, he was unemployed or underemployed for about \nfour years.  For the past four years, he has been working full-time.  Even still, Applicant \nhas not filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017.  There is \nnothing in the record to show that any progress has been made toward resolving his \ndelinquent debts.   Applicant only offers that he will pay the accounts by 2024.  He has \nnot shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness necessary to \nqualify for access to classified information, nor has he made a good faith effort to repay \nhis creditors or otherwise resolve the debt.  Under the circumstances, he has not acted \nreasonably and responsibly.  AG \u00b6 20(b) does not provide full mitigation here and the \nothers are not applicable.   \n\n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a., through 1.h.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAlthough Applicant had unforeseen circumstances that were beyond her control; \nother than her bare averments, she has yet to address her significant, past-due \nautomobile debt. The record does not establish mitigation of financial security concerns \nunder the provisions of AG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She has not met her burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. Once she can \ndemonstrate she has addressed her automobile loan default; and has no other past-due \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindebtedness, Applicant may again be eligible for a security clearance; sometime in the \nfuture, but not now. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n    AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.l.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/25/2020 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted security clearance applications on October 19, 2015 (SCA1) \nand March 30, 2018 (SCA2). On December 18, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 31, 2020, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. On April 30, 2020, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 8. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on May 6, 2020, and \n\n \n2 \n \ndid not respond. Items 1 through 3 are the pleadings in the case. Items 4 through 8 are \nadmitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on July 6, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 60, is married with one adult child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 1982 and a master\u2019s degree in 1988. He has held a DOD security clearance since \n1983. He has been employed full time as an engineer by a defense contractor since \n2001, and part time as a lecturer by a state university since 2013. (SCA1, SCA2) \n \nApplicant accumulated significant debts due to his and his wife\u2019s excessive \nspending which led them to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2012. Their \nreported liabilities totaled $481,890, including a $346,217 home-mortgage account, a \n$7,000 tax debt, and unsecured debts totaling $125,526. They paid $170,174 during a \nperiod of 59 months pursuant to the Chapter 13 repayment plan. The bankruptcy was \ndischarged in January 2018. (Item 7 at 10; Item 8) \n \nApplicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2012 through 2018 for reasons he did not specify in the record. Those returns \nremain unfiled. The $7,000 tax debt reported during his bankruptcy related to state \nincome taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016, which he repaid in 2018. As of January \n2019, he owed $80,000 in federal income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2017. He \nattributed his delinquent taxes to excessive spending during those tax years. In January \n2019, he anticipated setting up a repayment plan to resolve his federal tax debts. In \nAugust 2019, he anticipated making a $500 payment to the IRS in September 2019. In \nhis January 2020 SOR answer, in an apparent reference to his federal tax debts, he \nstated that he \u201cpayed some liens\u201d and was \u201cpaying increased taxes\u201d toward \u201ceventual \ncompliance.\u201d He did not provide any documents corroborating agreements or payments \nto resolve his federal tax debts. Since his delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in \nthe SOR, they will be considered only in the context of evaluating the whole person \nconcept and mitigation. (Item 3; Item 7 at 10-11, 16-17) \n \nBetween approximately 2000 and 2017, Applicant misused his company-issued \ncredit card by paying for personal expenses related to the long-distance commute \nbetween his home and work, including gas, meals, and hotels. During the period when \nhe misused the credit card, he was aware of his company\u2019s policy that it could only be \nused for authorized work-related expenses. He was not confronted about his misuse \nuntil February 2017, at which time the policy was reiterated to him and he was required \nto complete follow-up training related to proper use of the credit card. His employer \nestimated that Applicant charged personal expenses to his company-issued credit card \ntotaling $109,514 between February 2008 and February 2017. Applicant estimated that \nthe total personal expenses he charged was approximately $1,000,000 between 2000 \nand 2016. (Item 5 at 13, 39-40; Item 6; Item 7 at 11) \n \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each question on SCA1 about his financial record, \nincluding whether, in the last seven years, he had filed a petition for bankruptcy or failed \nto file his federal or state tax returns or pay his federal or state taxes. He affirmed those \n\n \n3 \n \n\u201cno\u201d responses in October 2015 by certifying that \u201cmy statements on this form . . . are \ntrue, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in \ngood faith.\u201d  (Item 4 at 34-35) \n \nOn SCA2, Applicant reported his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, his failure to file \nhis federal tax return and pay approximately $7,000 in federal taxes for tax year 2012, \nand his credit-card misuse. He affirmed those responses in March 2018 by certifying \nthat \u201cmy statements on this form . . . are true, complete, and correct to the best of my \nknowledge and belief and are made in good faith.\u201d (Item 5 at 38-39, 40-41) \n \nApplicant was interviewed in January 2019 in connection with his security-\nclearance investigation to discuss, among other things, the contents of SCA2. He was \nforthcoming about the facts and circumstances surrounding his derogatory financial \nhistory, including facts that were not disclosed on SCA1 or SCA2. He claimed that he \ndid not report his failure to file state tax returns and pay state taxes for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2016 on SCA2 due to oversight. He did not address why he had not disclosed \nhis failure to file federal tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016 on SCA2. He also \nclaimed that he listed owing $7,000 in federal taxes on SCA2 because he believed that \nwas the total amount that he owed at the time, and only later learned that the $7,000 \namount related to his state taxes and that he actually owed $80,000 in federal taxes. \n(Item 7 at 10-11) \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant asserted that his overall financial status had improved \nafter he completed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy process. He acknowledged that he \nremained in arrears with his tax payments, but was timely meeting his other financial \nobligations and had eliminated the use of credit cards. He reported a monthly net \nremainder of about $2,000, taking into consideration his and his wife\u2019s income and \nexpenses, which included amounts he anticipated spending to repay his taxes. In \nJanuary 2020, Applicant argued that the successful discharge of his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy demonstrated his ability to manage his finances. He and his wife both \ncompleted a financial management course in connection with their Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. (Item 3; Item 7 at 9-10; Item 8 at 8-9) \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the Guideline F and Guideline E \nallegations. He admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy and his failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2014 on SCA1. He also admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his \nfailure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016 on \nSCA2. His failure to disclose his unfiled 2012 state income tax return on SCA2 was not \nalleged in the SOR. While he accepted responsibility for his \u201creporting failures,\u201d he \nargued that his exemplary work record of 20 years and record of complying with \nprogram security guidelines for protecting information should be taken into \nconsideration. The facts surrounding the deliberate falsifications alleged in the SOR of \nSCA1 included tax year 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and of SCA2 included tax year 2017 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). Given the dates that the respective SCAs were certified, tax years 2015 and 2017 \nwould not have been reportable. Thus, I have not considered those dates in the \nrespective SOR allegations and answers. (Item 3) \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2)) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012))  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the written record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); AG \u00b6 19(e) \nconsistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible spending, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, a history of \nlate payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial indicators; and AG \u00b6 19(f) \n(failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \n \n \nNone of the following potentially applicable mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n \n6 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nBankruptcy is an acceptable form of debt resolution. Thus, the concern is not \nwith Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy itself, but with the underlying history of financial \nindebtedness and irresponsibility surrounding it that continue to persist. Accordingly, \nwhile I find SOR \u00b6 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor, the facts alleged therein remain relevant to \nmy analysis of the ongoing concern surrounding his failure to timely file state and \nfederal tax returns and pay federal taxes. While Applicant is credited with successfully \nresolving significant delinquent debts through bankruptcy and with repaying his \ndelinquent state tax debt, he did not meet his burden to establish mitigation under \nGuideline F.  \n \n \nBecause Applicant\u2019s claims were unsubstantiated by corroborating documentary \nevidence, I cannot conclude that he has established any payment plans or made any \npayments to resolve his delinquent federal taxes. His persistent delay in filing his tax \nreturns without any justifiable excuse does not demonstrate responsible action and calls \ninto question his suitability for access to classified information. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing income tax returns when \ndue, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015)). \u201cFailure to file income tax returns suggests that an applicant \nhas a problem with complying with well-established government rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)). I am left with \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Thus, I \ncannot conclude that he has mitigated the Guideline F concerns. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \n\n \n7 \n \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications of SCA1 and SCA2 establish the general \nconcerns involving questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations and the following specific disqualifying condition under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant\u2019s misuse of his company-issued credit card establishes the general \nconcerns involving questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, and the following specific disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant \nmisuse of Government or other employer's time or resources; and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \n \nNeither of the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this \nguideline are established: \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in \nrequesting a security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the \nhonesty of the applicant. The Appeal Board has explained that beginning with an \napplicant\u2019s responses in the application, \n \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a \ncompelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. \nThat compelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in \nbeing able to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to \nthe government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002)) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his known derogatory financial history on SCA1 \nwas security significant on its own. His subsequent deliberate lack of full candor on \nSCA2 with respect to his extended non-compliance with tax return filing requirements \nfurther called his reliability into question. Taken together with his credit-card misuse, his \ndeliberate SCA falsifications demonstrate a willingness to place his own self-interest \nabove his legal obligations. He is credited with disclosing at least some of his negative \nfinancial history on SCA2 which placed the Government on sufficient notice to \ninvestigate further. Moreover, the fact that Applicant was forthcoming about the true \nextent of his financial history during his security clearance interview reflects favorably \nupon him. However, Applicant\u2019s deliberate SCA falsifications, not once but twice, and \nhis credit-card misuse establish a pattern of questionable behavior that I am unable to \nconclude is not likely to recur. I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Thus, I cannot conclude that he has mitigated the \nGuideline E concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \n\n \n9 \n \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his failure to timely file federal income tax returns and his personal \nconduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 9, 2019. On \nAugust 30, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 23, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on December 27, 2019. On December 30, 2019, a complete copy of the file \n\n \n2 \n \nof relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. He received the FORM on January 9, 2020, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 3, 2020.  \n \nThe FORM included a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) conducted \non April 10, 2019. (FORM Item 4.) The PSI summary was not authenticated as required \nby Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions \nor updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. I conclude that he waived any \nobjections to the PSI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. Although pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old security specialist employed by defense contractors \nsince December 2017. He graduated from high school in June 1985. He served on active \nduty in the U.S. Air Force from August 1985 to March 1991 and received an honorable \ndischarge. He married in February 1998, divorced in October 2009, married in September \n2016, and divorced in May 2018. He has two children, ages 19 and 24. He attended a \nuniversity from September 2003 to March 2005 but did not receive a degree. He first \nreceived a security clearance while in the Air Force in 1986 and again in September 2009 \nas an employee of a defense contractor. \n \nApplicant worked for defense contractors as a police advisor in Iraq from May 2007 \nto January 2009 and as a law enforcement professional in Afghanistan from March 2009 \nto October 2012. He was unemployed from October 2012 to December 2013. He was a \ncounty police officer from December 2013 to May 2014 and then moved to another state \nand was unemployed for three months. He worked in the private sector as a field \ntechnician from August 2014 to January 2016. He relocated to another state again and \nwas unemployed from January to March 2016. He worked in the private sector as a \nsecurity officer from March 2016 to January 2017, when his company lost its contract. He \nwas unemployed from January to March 2017. He was employed as a commercial driver \nfrom May to October 2017, relocated again, and was unemployed from October to \nDecember 2017, when he was hired by a defense contractor. When that employer\u2019s \ncontract expired in January 2019, he was immediately hired for his current job.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $35,714, which are reflected \nin credit reports from March and December 2019. (FORM Items 5 and 6.) He admitted all \n\n \n3 \n \nthe debts in his answer to the SOR. The evidence concerning these debts is summarized \nbelow.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account referred for collection of $9,700. Applicant \nused this credit card to purchase a timeshare.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $5,568. Applicant used this \ncredit card for daily living expenses.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: collection account for $9,123. In the April 2019 PSI, Applicant was \nunable to provide any information about this account. The December 2019 credit report \nreflects that it is an educational debt. (FORM Item 6 at 1.) It became delinquent in May \n2017 and was referred for collection in September 2017.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g: collection accounts on behalf of the same original creditor \nfor $3,004; $2,730; $2,204; and $1,763. Applicant has provided no information about \nthese accounts.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: telecommunications account referred for collection of $681. This \ndebt was referred for collection in June 2016.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j: debts of $216 and $185 to an insurance company. Applicant \nswitched insurance companies before paying the full premium to the first insurance \ncompany. The debts are for unpaid premiums. \n \nApplicant provided no evidence of contacts with his creditors, payments, payment \nplans, disputes, or other resolution of the debts. In his answer to the SOR, he attributed \nhis delinquent debts to his divorce in 2009 and a substantial loss of income. He did not \nprovide any further details. He did not provide any information about the circumstances \nof his multiple moves from one state to another. He did not provide any information about \nhis current financial status. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s divorces and periods of \nunemployment were circumstances beyond his control. He provided no information about \nhis frequent relocations that would support a finding that they were conditions beyond his \ncontrol. He has not acted responsibly. He submitted no evidence of contact with creditors, \npayments, payment plans, settlement offers, disputes, or any other attempts to resolve \nthe debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n6 \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nservice in the U.S. Air Force and his service as an employee of defense contractors, \nincluding his service in a combat zone. Because Applicant requested a determination on \nthe record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations, and his admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in September 2017. Aside from two months of unemployment from July to September of 2017, he has worked for defense contractors since 1996. He holds a master\u2019s degree earned in 1990. He is divorced (married in 1987, divorced in 2017) and has two adult children. He has held a security clearance since 2002. (GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant had three delinquent credit card debts including a collection debt of $26,514 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a charged-off debt of $2,270 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and a collection debt of $21,118 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The debts were listed in credit reports from April 2018 and April 2019. (GE 2-3) Applicant credibly explained that his financial difficulties began when his then-wife lost her job in 2015 and remained unemployed for approximately 18 months. He further testified that he paid for the college education of both of his children and he is currently providing $400 monthly to his son to help fund his graduate studies. Applicant testified that his divorce in 2017 also impacted his finances. He paid his ex-wife a settlement lump sum of approximately $200,000, from his retirement account, and pays her alimony of $400 monthly. (Tr. at 24, 30-32, 35; An",

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n09/16/2020 \n______________ \nDecision \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on October 2, 2019, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. I was assigned the case on July 21, 2020. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 29, \n2020, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on August 20, 2020. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant objected \n\n2 \nto GE 2 on the basis of having inaccurate information. I overruled that objection \ndetermining that the objection went to the weight of the evidence as opposed to its \nadmissibility. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was identified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. \nApplicant testified and offered two exhibits (AE A-B), which were admitted without \nobjection. The record remained open until September 11, 2020, to allow Applicant to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence. He submitted AE C through E, which were \nadmitted without objection. The email correspondence documenting Applicant\u2019s \nsubmission of post-hearing evidence is marked as HE II. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 27, 2020.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations, and his admissions are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at \nhis present job in September 2017. Aside from two months of unemployment from July to \nSeptember of 2017, he has worked for defense contractors since 1996. He holds a \nmaster\u2019s degree earned in 1990. He is divorced (married in 1987, divorced in 2017) and \nhas two adult children. He has held a security clearance since 2002. (GE 1)  \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had three delinquent credit card debts including a \ncollection debt of $26,514 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a charged-off debt of $2,270 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and a \ncollection debt of $21,118 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The debts were listed in credit reports from April \n2018 and April 2019. (GE 2-3)  \nApplicant credibly explained that his financial difficulties began when his then-wife \nlost her job in 2015 and remained unemployed for approximately 18 months. He further \ntestified that he paid for the college education of both of his children and he is currently \nproviding $400 monthly to his son to help fund his graduate studies. Applicant testified \nthat his divorce in 2017 also impacted his finances. He paid his ex-wife a settlement lump \nsum of approximately $200,000, from his retirement account, and pays her alimony of \n$400 monthly. (Tr. at 24, 30-32, 35; Answer) \nApplicant documented that he earns approximately $168,000 per year from his job; \nthat his retirement account\u2019s balance is approximately $320,000; and that he is current \non his home mortgage payments. He also pointed out that he is current on the student \nloan payments he took out to assist his son with his undergraduate payments and that he \nowns a second home worth approximately $130,000 with no mortgage obligation. (Tr. at \n35, 39-40; Answer) \nThe status of his delinquent debts is as follows: \nCredit Card Debt-$26,514 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant credibly explained that he \nbecame delinquent on this account when his ex-wife was unemployed. He attempted to \nnegotiate a lower payment and interest rate, but was told by the creditor the only way to \n\n3 \ndo so was to stop making payments. He did so, which resulted in the delinquency. He \ndocumented that he reached a settlement with the creditor in August 2020 and paid the \nagreed upon settlement amount of approximately $19,700 in September 2020 (the \ndocumentation showed his written check to the creditor, but not the completed \ntransaction. I infer that the check process was completed). This debt is resolved. (Tr. at \n24-26, 37-38; AE B, E)\nCredit Card Debt-$2,270 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant credibly explained that he \nbecame delinquent on this account when his ex-wife was unemployed. He attempted to \nnegotiate a lower payment and interest rate, but was told by the creditor the only way to \ndo so was to stop making payments. He did so, which resulted in the delinquency. He \ndocumented that he reached a settlement with the creditor in August 2020 and paid the \nagreed upon settlement amount of approximately $1,795 in August 2020 (the \ndocumentation showed his written check to the creditor, but not the completed \ntransaction. I infer that the check process was completed). This debt is resolved. (Tr. at \n27-28; AE C-D)\nCredit Card Debt-$21,118 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant credibly explained that he \nbecame delinquent on this account when his ex-wife was unemployed. He attempted to \nnegotiate a lower payment and interest rate, but was told by the creditor the only way to \ndo so was to stop making payments. He did so, which resulted in the delinquency. He \ndocumented that he reached a settlement with the creditor in July 2018 and paid the \nagreed upon settlement amount of approximately $16,000 in July 2018. This debt is \nresolved. (Tr. at 35-36; AE A; Answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n\n4 \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n5 \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant incurred credit card debts after his then wife became unemployed. He \nalso stopped paying the debts in order to negotiate better terms with the creditors. I find \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised.  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; and\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s divorce and period of unemployment contributed to his delinquent \ndebts. Although he was not particularly timely in negotiating settlements on these three \ndebts, he ultimately resolved them all through settlement payments. All the above \nmitigating conditions have some applicability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n\n6 \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, and the circumstances surrounding his \nindebtedness. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor, employed since April 2018. He graduated from high school in 2007 and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He has been married since 2008. Applicant served on active duty in the United States Air Force from 2009 to 2016. He was disciplined under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) (non-judicial punishment), for dereliction of duty, after he fell asleep while on armed flight-line security patrol. He also disobeyed an order to refrain from driving on base after he was caught driving with expired tags. He was discharged with a general discharge, under honorable conditions in 2016. He held a DOD security clearance while on active duty. The SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $34,000 in 12 delinquent debts. In addition, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA by deliberately failing to disclose debts listed as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. Applicant denied the Guideline F allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, c, and f, and admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, e, g, h, i, j, k, and l, all with explanations. In addition, he admitted the Guideline E allegation under SOR \u00b6 2.a, with an explanation. The SOR allegations are supported by sufficient evidence in the record. SOR \u00b6 1.a is a 2016 vehicle loan on which Applicant defaulted in 2016. Applicant\u2019s 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) shows the loan was opened in August 2016, and the last activity was in October 2016. The vehicle was repossessed",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 30, 2018. On \nOctober 22, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), \napplicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 14, 2019, and requested a decision \nbased on the written record without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief with \nsupporting documents, known as the file of relevant material (FORM), was submitted by \nDepartment Counsel on December 23, 2019. A complete copy of the FORM was provided \nto Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, rebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM and \nsubmitted a reply, dated March 23, 2020. The case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020. \nApplicant provided Applicant Exhibit (AE) A in response to the FORM, and did not object \nto admission of his personal subject interview (PSI) summary (GE 5) in the record. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 and (AE) A are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor, employed \nsince April 2018. He graduated from high school in 2007 and received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2018. He has been married since 2008. Applicant served on active duty in the United \nStates Air Force from 2009 to 2016. He was disciplined under Article 15, Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ) (non-judicial punishment), for dereliction of duty, after he fell \nasleep while on armed flight-line security patrol. He also disobeyed an order to refrain \nfrom driving on base after he was caught driving with expired tags. He was discharged \nwith a general discharge, under honorable conditions in 2016. He held a DOD security \nclearance while on active duty. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $34,000 in 12 delinquent debts. \nIn addition, the SOR alleges Applicant falsified his 2018 SCA by deliberately failing to \ndisclose debts listed as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l. Applicant denied the Guideline F \nallegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, c, and f, and admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, e, g, h, i, j, k, and l, \nall with explanations. In addition, he admitted the Guideline E allegation under SOR \u00b6 2.a, \nwith an explanation. The SOR allegations are supported by sufficient evidence in the \nrecord. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a 2016 vehicle loan on which Applicant defaulted in 2016. Applicant\u2019s \n2019 credit bureau report (CBR) shows the loan was opened in August 2016, and the last \nactivity was in October 2016. The vehicle was repossessed in 2016 and the debt was \ncharged off with a past-due amount of $13,838. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nclaimed the loan was \u201cclosed off in December 21, 2016.\u201d He was unable to pay because \nhe was attending school and his GI Bill payment was delayed until November 2016. He \nstated that by then, it was too late to catch up on the payments. Applicant claimed in his \nresponse to the FORM, that this account was \u201cclosed\u201d based on a credit report entry, and \nhe is disputing the reporting of the debt on his credit report. In an addendum to his Answer \nto the SOR and in his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that this debt was \ncombined with another auto loan, and he now owes $28,368 on both. He provided a credit \nreport entry showing that the original SOR loan amount has not changed, and no \ndocumentary evidence showing payments on the account. This debt remains unresolved. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off bank debt for approximately $5,748. Applicant incurred \nthis debt while on active duty, but fell behind when he left the service and attended school. \nThe debt was placed in collections, and Applicant is disputing the reporting of the debt on \nhis credit report. In November 2019, Applicant stated that he offered to pay $5 per month, \nbut the collection agent wanted more. The debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection account for a delinquent auto loan for approximately \n$5,396, opened in August 2012 with last activity in April 2013. It is a reported debt on \nApplicant\u2019s May 2019 CBR. The vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. Applicant stated \nthat he disputed the debt as aged, and it was removed from his credit report. The account \nhas been removed from his CBR in November 2019, but the debt remained unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a collection account for a delinquent loan in the approximate amount \nof $4,090. Applicant stated in his Answer to the SOR that he obtained the loan while on \nactive duty in order to meet payments on other debts. He began a payment plan on \nOctober 31, 2019 where he agreed to pay $5 per month. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant stated he began $5 per month payments in November 2019, and paid monthly \nthrough February 2020. No documentary evidence showing regular payments on a \nrepayment plan was submitted. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is another loan Applicant obtained because he was behind on bills and \nvery close to losing his car. He described this lender as a \u201cpredatory payday loan for \nmilitary personnel.\u201d Applicant stated in his Answer to the SOR, that he agreed to make \n$10 per month payments on October 28, 2019. In his response to the FORM, he reiterated \nhis agreement to pay $10 per month, but he provided an undated screen shot of one \n\u201csuccessful payment.\u201d No other documentary evidence showing regular payments on a \nrepayment plan was submitted. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a bank credit card that was charged off for approximately $539. In \nApplicant\u2019s Answer, he stated that the account was \u201cclosed\u201d in November 2016, after \nreaching the high-credit limit and the account became delinquent. Applicant claimed he \nresolved the debt by disputing it, and he believes the account is no longer reported on his \nCBR. He submitted a screen shot showing the reasons for the dispute, but no final \ndecision. The account is reported on Applicant\u2019s 2019 CBR, and he did not submit a more \nrecent credit report showing the account was removed. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a collection account for a credit card debt for approximately $485. \nApplicant stated in his Answer to the SOR, that he opened the credit card account to \nimprove his credit. He maximized the charges on the account and could not pay because \nhe was not financially sound. He arranged to pay $5 per month beginning in November \n2019, and showed a payment in November. In his response to the FORM, Applicant \nstated that he made payments in December 2019 through February 2020, but attached \nonly the November payment as evidence. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a delinquent cable provider account for approximately $380. \nApplicant fell behind on rent and cable payments after leaving active duty, and moved out \n\n \n4 \n \nof the house in which he was living. He contacted the creditor and agreed to pay $52 per \nmonth beginning with a $10 payment in November 2019. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant stated that he can afford to pay $52 per month, and plans to pay monthly until \nthe debt is satisfied. He did not provide documentary evidence of any payments made on \nthis debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is another debt to a cable provider for $149. Applicant stated in his \nAnswer to the SOR, that he fell behind on this bill while on active duty due to a \u201csevere \nlack of judgment.\u201d He agreed to pay the full balance due at the end of December 2019. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he agreed to pay the debt by January \n2020, but failed to do so in order to save money for the expected birth of twins. He now \nintends to pay the debt by April 20, 2020, and used a credit card on March 16, 2020, to \nmake a $10 down payment as his promise to pay the balance in April. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is an insurance company debt for $103. Applicant stated he was young \nand made poor financial decisions, and fell behind on his insurance payments. He agreed \nto pay the full balance in January 2020. In his response to the FORM, Applicant again \nstated that he did not pay the balance as promised, but intends to make a $50 payment \nin March, and pay the balance in April 2020. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a $2,196 debt owed to a company managing Air Force military \nhousing. Applicant left the home in 2016 and did not pay for damage to the property. \nApplicant contacted the creditor and agreed to begin paying $180 per month for four \nmonths in 2020. He did not pay the debt earlier because they requested a lump-sum \npayment and Applicant had no savings. He noted that he is ashamed of his action and \nhas since begun to improve himself. In his response to the FORM, Applicant had not \nmade any payments because he has not received a written notice of the payment plan \nagreement in the mail. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a delinquent medical debt for approximately $645. Applicant incurred \nthe debt from a medical provider, and believed his military insurance would cover the \ncosts. He stated that he attempted to contact the creditor, but their phone is no longer in \nservice. The debt is reflected on a 2018 CBR, but is not reported on his 2019 CBR. In his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant claims that he contacted the creditor in November 2019, \nbut has been unable to reach them since. \n \nIn SCA Section 26, Applicant also asked to disclose delinquencies involving \nroutine accounts; including whether in the past seven years he had a judgment; lien; \nrepossession; defaulted loans; debts in collections; suspended, charged off, or canceled \ncredit cards; or if he had been over 120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt or currently over \n120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant claimed in his \nAnswer to the SOR, that he did not report his delinquent debts on his SCA because he \ndid not know if the collections accounts were still on his credit report, or which accounts \nwere open or closed. Applicant discussed his debts with the government investigator \nduring his PSI, admitted there were numerous debts, and expressed his shame for his \nactions.  \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant stated in his Answer to the SOR that he fell behind on debts while trying \nto satisfy another \u201cpayday lender,\u201d and \u201ceverything snowballed out of control and [he] \ncould not catch up.\u201d He believes he learned from his mistakes and has improved as an \nadult. He is current on two car payments and he never missed a rent payment to his \ngrandmother while he lived with her. He reported that he is current on his utility bills and \nrent with his present landlord. His credit score has improved, and he has been able to \npay for in-vitro fertilization treatments and labor and delivery costs. He believes he now \nmanages money more responsibly, and resents the implication that he is irresponsible. \nNo evidence of his current financial status or financial counseling was submitted. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \n\n \n6 \n \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n7 \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant noted his inability to pay debts while on active duty, and after leaving the \nmilitary and attending school, attributing his problems to a delay in receiving GI Bill \npayments, and the need to satisfy a payday loan creditor. In response to his mounting \ndebts, he resorted to using additional payday, bank, and credit-card lenders, and \ncontinued to fall behind. Applicant had two vehicle repossessions on loans that defaulted \nrelatively quickly. Since he accumulated most of the debts in 2016, he has done little to \nsatisfy them until the end of 2019 when his security eligibility came into question.  \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation relating to his SOR debts such \nas: (1) proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of \nchecks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the \ncreditor; (2) correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; \n(3) copies of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies \nindicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a \nbelief; (4) evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers \nor agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of \nprogress or resolution. However, I give Applicant the benefit of the doubt on payment \nplans for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g, to which he has made regular payments despite their \nsmall amounts. Efforts to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.l are sufficient mitigation. \n \nThe remaining debts have not been adequately addressed by reasonable efforts \nto pay or legitimate disputes. Promises or plans for future debt resolution are insufficient \nto apply mitigation credit for responsible actions or good-faith efforts. There is no evidence \nof financial counseling, and there is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved and will not recur in the future. Overall, Applicant has shown a history of \nirresponsible spending without an ability to pay debts. Most of the debts were incurred in \n2016 or before, but little was done to attempt to resolve them until after the SOR was \nissued. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (d) are not fully applicable. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAlthough Applicant disputed several negative entries on his credit report, AG \u00b6 \n20(e) requires that Applicant show that he \u201chas a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.\u201d He did not provide sufficient \u201cdocumented proof\u201d of the basis of the \ndisputes or actions to resolve the issues, rather he generally admitted the existence of \nthe debts, but disputed them because they were aged or closed accounts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \nnot applicable with respect to the debts he contested.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial status continues to raise significant doubts about his financial \nmanagement decisions, personal responsibility, and ability to address his delinquent \ndebts. I am not convinced Applicant makes good financial decisions, and his financial \nstatus continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or repossession of his vehicles on \nhis April 30, 2018 SCA. The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for \nanalyzing falsification cases, stating:  \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). The record evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally \nfalsified his 2018 SCA. The evidence shows that Applicant clearly was aware of the \nexistence of the debts and repossessions when he completed his SCA, although he may \nnot have been aware of the credit reporting status of the debts at the time. Applicant \ndiscussed the delinquent accounts with the government investigator during his PSI. He \nacknowledged that he did not report his debts because \u201cthere were a lot of them and he \nwas ashamed.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose at \nleast one delinquent debt and the repossession of his vehicles on his SCA. In his SOR \nAnswer, Applicant failed to take responsibility for the falsification of his SCA when he \nclaimed that he did not know the status of his debts. His behavior continues to cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, employment history, financial difficulties, unemployment and \nunderemployment. However, I remain unconvinced of his financial responsibility and \nability, intent, and desire to resolve his financial obligations, and his judgment, honesty, \nand willingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.f, 1.h \u2013 1k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as admin support with his current employer since October 2014. A 2005 high school graduate, he earned credits from a college but no degree. He served in various capacities with the U.S. military after enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in November 2007. He served on active duty until November 2011, when he transitioned into the USMC Inactive Reserve. In April 2013, he entered the U.S. Army Active Reserve, and he remained there until May 2015, when he again returned to the USMC Inactive Reserve. He remained with the USMC Inactive Reserve until September 2015, when he was honorably discharged. He was granted a secret clearance in 2009. He was married in 2010, and he has two children, born in 2010 and 2012, as well as a stepchild, born in 2008.

Lynch-Epps, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/19/2020\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 30, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On August 28, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn October 11, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 5, 2019, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on December 20, 2019. His response was due on January 19, 2020. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of February 14, 2020, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on February 14, 2020. The record closed on \nFebruary 14, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with very brief comments, all of \nthe SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.g.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas admin support with his current employer since October 2014. A 2005 high school \ngraduate, he earned credits from a college but no degree. He served in various capacities \nwith the U.S. military after enlisting in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) in November 2007. \nHe served on active duty until November 2011, when he transitioned into the USMC \nInactive Reserve. In April 2013, he entered the U.S. Army Active Reserve, and he \nremained there until May 2015, when he again returned to the USMC Inactive Reserve. \nHe remained with the USMC Inactive Reserve until September 2015, when he was \nhonorably discharged. He was granted a secret clearance in 2009. He was married in \n2010, and he has two children, born in 2010 and 2012, as well as a stepchild, born in \n2008.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated February 16, 2019); Item 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nAugust 6, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86, dated January 30, 2019); Item 6 (Enhanced Subject \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nInterview, dated March 12, 2019); and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated \nOctober 11, 2019).  \nApplicant reported that he was unemployed from November 2011, when he was \nhonorably discharged from active duty, until April 2012; from September 2012, when he \nvoluntarily quit a job, until May 2013; and from May 2014, when he voluntarily quit another \njob, until June 2014. He attributed his financial problems to a variety of factors: he lived \nabove his means for an unspecified period; he went through periods of unemployment; \nhis wife was not earning enough; and there were unspecified issues with the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) involving an overpayment, the \u201cgarnishment\u201d of his \nfederal and state income tax refunds totaling approximately $10,000, and a successful \nappeal by him, followed by a delay in refunding those funds to him. (Item 6, at 4; Item 3, \nat 44) Applicant failed to submit any documents to support the issues raised regarding \nthe VA. \nIn his January 2019 SF 86, Applicant listed four delinquent accounts, including \nthree apartment leases, two of which he claimed had already been resolved, and a \nrepossessed automobile. He acknowledged that he had not taken any action to resolve \nthe other lease or the automobile loan, but he intended to do so. (Item 3, at 44-47)  \nIn March 2019, during an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged that he had several other \ndelinquent accounts. He claimed that, until the time of the interview, his options for \nrectifying his financial situation had been limited, but with steady job, he was not seeking \ncounseling or credit consolidation services to solve his financial issues. He stated that \nonce he receives his tax refund, he would start rectifying some of his delinquent accounts. \nThe OPM investigator offered Applicant the opportunity to furnish documentation \nregarding his delinquent accounts, but he failed to do so during or even after the interview. \n(Item 6, at 4) \n The SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $15,147, as \nset forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a jointly-held automobile loan on a vehicle that was \nrepossessed, leaving a past-due balance of $2,026 that was placed for collection (Item \n5, at 6); SOR \u00b6 1.b. is an individual automobile loan with a past-due and unpaid balance \nof $8,651 that was placed for collection (Item 5, at 6); SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a wireless-telephone \naccount with an unpaid balance of $2,035 that first became delinquent in 2015 and was \neventually sold to a debt purchaser (Item 5, at 6; Item 4, at 1-2); SOR \u00b6 1.d. is an \nunspecified type of account with a federal department with an unpaid balance of $833 \nthat was charged off (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 2); SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a medical account with an \nunpaid balance of $1,125 that was placed for collection in 2018 (Item 5, at 9); SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nis a cable-television account with an unpaid balance of $293 that was placed for collection \nin 2018 (Item 5, at 9); and SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a fitness center or gymnasium account with an \nunpaid balance of $184 that was placed for collection in 2019 (Item 5, at 9). \n. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nOther than Applicant\u2019s promised intentions to start resolving his delinquent \naccounts, he failed to offer any evidence, oral or documentary, of any such efforts. He did \nnot state that he had commenced negotiations with any of his creditors, or that he had \nstarted making payments to any of his creditors. There is still no evidence of financial \ncounseling. In November 2019, Department Counsel noted in the FORM that Applicant \nhad not provided any documentation to support his contentions in his Answer to the SOR, \nessentially that he would satisfy his delinquent debts in the near future. Despite that \nnotice, Applicant failed to furnish any material documentation. In the absence of such \ndocumentation, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts have not yet entered the \nprocess of being resolved. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s contention in March 2019 that his overall financial situation \nwas sufficient to not seek financial counseling or credit consolidation, it is not known what \nApplicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did not report his current net \nmonthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might be available \nfor discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no \nevidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial information, it \nremains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than \nhe had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $15,147. One \nof those debts became delinquent as early as 2015, and by the time the record closed in \nFebruary 2020, none of them had been addressed by Applicant. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nhave been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to \nsatisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to a variety of factors: he lived above his means for an \nunspecified period; he went through periods of unemployment; his wife was not earning \nenough; and there were unspecified issues with the VA involving an overpayment, the \n\u201cgarnishment\u201d of his federal and state income tax refunds totaling approximately $10,000, \nand a successful appeal by him, followed by a delay in refunding those funds to him. As \nnoted above, one of those debts became delinquent as early as 2015, and, at least until \nthe date the record closed, none of them were addressed by Applicant. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)).  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent accounts for several years, \nmake it rather easy to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent and they \nare likely to remain unchanged. Applicant completed his SF 86 in January 2019; \nunderwent his OPM interview in March 2019; and the SOR was issued in August 2019. \nEach step of the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the \nsignificance of the financial issues confronting him. In October 2019, he promised to \nsatisfy his debts in the near future. As of the closing of the record, he has taken no actions \nto address, much less resolve, any of his delinquent accounts. None of his delinquent \ndebts are even in the process of being addressed. \n \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant intentionally chose to ignore his \ndelinquent accounts even after he was interviewed by OPM. He failed to resolve any of \nhis delinquent accounts or submit recommended documentation in or after March 2019 \u2013 \nnearly one year ago. An applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after \nbeing placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in \nthe judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at \n5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)).  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \nIn the absence of any positive activity by Applicant, of financial counseling, and a \nbudget, it remains difficult to determine if he is currently in a better position financially \n\n8 \n                                      \n \nthan he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as \nadmin support with his current employer since October 2014. A 2005 high school \ngraduate, he earned credits from a college but no degree. He served in various capacities \nwith the U.S. military after enlisting in the USMC in November 2007. He served on active \nduty until November 2011, when he transitioned into the USMC Inactive Reserve. In April \n2013, he entered the U.S. Army Active Reserve, and he remained there until May 2015, \nwhen he again returned to the USMC Inactive Reserve. He remained with the USMC \nInactive Reserve until September 2015, when he was honorably discharged. He was \ngranted a secret clearance in 2009. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has seven delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $15,147. As of the date the record closed in February 2020, none of them \nwere addressed by Applicant, even though he promised that he would start doing so in \nthe near future \u2013 nearly one year ago.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is abysmal at best, delaying any resolution efforts \nat least until after the record closed in February 2020. Overall, the evidence leaves me \nwith substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Temple, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/16/2020 \nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. \nEligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 17, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On September 24, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked.  \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 11, 2019, and he elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on March 25, 2020, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on April 9, 2020. His response was due on May 9, 2020. Applicant timely \nsubmitted a number of documents in response to the FORM, to which there were no \nobjections. The case was assigned to me on June 12, 2020. The record closed on June \n12, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nSOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.o.), and he \ndenied all of the SOR allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through \n2.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and his comments are incorporated herein. As a result of \nthe evidence furnished with respect to the allegations related to foreign influence, the \nGovernment withdrew SOR allegations 2.a. through 2.c., and those allegations are no \nlonger an issue. (FORM, at 1) After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in \nthe record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nin several positions of increased importance with his current employer since September \n2014, and he now supervises a staff of 18 individuals. According to his Agency Director, \nApplicant is a \u201cmission critical\u201d employee providing \u201cessential\u201d federal government \nservices. (Attachment 5, dated March 23, 2020, to Response to the FORM) He previously \nserved as a doorman from May 2011 until February 2014, and he was unemployed from \nFebruary 2014 until September 2014. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. He has \nnever served in the U.S. military. He is unsure if he had been granted a security clearance \nwhen he took his current job. He has never been married.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated January 17, 2018); Item 7 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated February 2, 2018); \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nItem 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated June 4, 2019); Item 6 (LexisNexis Judgment and \nLien Filings, undated); Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to the SOR, dated October 11, 2019), \n2018); and Applicant\u2019s Responses to the FORM, dated April 17, 2020, with attachments).  \nIn addition to his period of unemployment, Applicant reported that he had a 2012 \nbankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. He attributed his \nfinancial problems to the following factors: he was young and not mature enough to \nhandle his personal finances back then, that he could not handle his finances while in \ncollege, and that he did not know how to handle his finances when he was in his 20s. \n(Item 2, at 1; Item 3, at 35; Response to the FORM, at 1-2) He acknowledged making \nmistakes in the past, but contends that he has learned from his mistakes and is now a \ndifferent person. He now has a budget as well as a plan to resolve his delinquent debts. \n(Response to the FORM, at 1) \nIn addition to the 2012 bankruptcy, the SOR alleged 14 delinquent accounts \ntotaling approximately $66,905, with one delinquent credit-card account in the amount of \n$2,867, and the remaining delinquent accounts, totaling $64,038, characterized as \nstudent loans. The accounts can be divided into two groups: (a) those for which Applicant \ncontends that he had paid off; and (b) those for which Applicant contends that they are \nunder repayment plans and are in the process of being paid off. \nIn the first group, there are two delinquent accounts, set forth as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. is a student loan with a university that became delinquent and went to \njudgment in the amount of $7,604 in 2017. (Item 7, at 6; Item 8, at 2; and Item 6) Applicant \ncontended that he had been making payments for \u201cthe past 2 years,\u201d and that he reduced \nthe unpaid balance to $5,531. (Item 2, at 1) On October 9, 2019, he made a final payment \nto the designated Court Officer in the amount of $5,351, and on December 6, 2019, a \nWarrant to Satisfy Judgment was filed. (Item 2, attachments; Response to the FORM \nattachments) The judgment has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $2,867 that was \nplaced for collection. (Item 8, at 2) The creditor and Applicant agreed to a settlement for \na reduced amount, and on October 11, 2019, Applicant made a payment in the amount \nof $1,679. (Item 2, at 1; Response to the FORM, at 1; Settlement Paid Confirmation, dated \nOctober 28, 2019, attached to the Response to the FORM) The account has been \nresolved. \nIn the second group, there are 12 delinquent student-loan accounts which \nApplicant contended he is in the process of resolving: SOR \u00b6 1.b. is with a servicer of \nstudent loans, and has an unpaid and past-due balance of $15,734 that was placed for \ncollection in 2017. (Item 8, at 1; Item 7, at 15) Applicant and the creditor agreed to an \nincome-driven repayment plan, and in June 2019, three months before the SOR was \nissued, he made his initial payment of over $187. On a monthly basis thereafter, he \ncontinued to make payments of at least that amount, and sometimes over $191. The most \nrecent verified payment occurred in April 2020. (Account History, various dates, attached \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nto Item 2 and Response to the FORM; Payment Confirmation, dated January 14, 2020, \nattached to Response to the FORM)  \nAs part of the federal CARES ACT legislation associated with the COVID-19 \npandemic passed on March 27, 2020, the loan servicer suspended payments and interest \naccrual on all U.S. Department of Education (DOE) owned loans until September 30, \n2020. (www.navient.com/covid-19) In other words, Applicant\u2019s student loans with the loan \nservicer are currently in a forbearance status. Nevertheless, despite the forbearance \nstatus, he apparently continued to voluntarily make at least one payment after it went into \neffect. The account was in the process of being resolved. \n The remaining defaulted student loans are currently held by the DOE, and they \nare in the following amounts: SOR \u00b6 1.c.

(Item 7, at 6-8; Item 8, at 2, 8) In October 2019, Applicant and the credit recovery \ncompany that was representing the DOE established a rehabilitation agreement under \nwhich it was determined that, based on his income, he was to make monthly payments in \nthe amount of $92. That agreement was quickly modified in November 2019 when all of \nhis student loans were consolidated, and he also paid an additional $118 for the remaining \nloans. Commencing in December 2019, the consolidated payment of $210 was made by \nautomatic electronic withdrawals, and it was established that such future payments in the \nsame amount was authorized. According to the credit recovery company, Applicant had \na principal balance of $35,556; interest in the amount of $7,129; and a collection charge \nof $7,649, totaling nearly $50,335. (Item 2, at 1; Bank Account debit, dated October 11, \n2019, attached to Item 2; Letter, dated October 10, 2019; and Recurring Payment \nConfirmation, dated November 12, 2019, both attached to the Response to the FORM)  \nApplicant brought the student loans out of a default status when he started his \nmonthly payments under the rehabilitation agreement, and although it was not developed \nthat the payments have been continued, the loans are in forbearance, and they are in the \nprocess of being resolved. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a., he \nvoluntarily filed for such bankruptcy on December 30, 2011. He also completed credit \ncounseling that same day and received a certificate. He listed $46,573 owed to creditors \nholding unsecured priority claims, essentially student loans; as well a $20,036 owed to \ncreditors holding unsecured claims, essentially consumer loans and credit-card balances, \nbut also including the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The total of liabilities ($66,609) was, \naccording to the Bankruptcy Trustee, scheduled to be discharged. An Order was issued \non April 5, 2012, discharging the debtor. (Items 4 and 5 (Extracts of the bankruptcy file, \nvarious dates)) While student loans are not normally discharged without convincing the \nbankruptcy judge of certain factors, in this instance, the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is \ndescribed in the bankruptcy petition as an unsecured nonpriority claim on an installment \naccount, turned into a judgment, and it appears that it was discharged by the bankruptcy \njudge, as well as paid off by Applicant.  \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s contention that he has changed his financial outlook and ways \nsince he matured into his 30s, it is not known what his current financial resources may be \nbecause he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any \nmonthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. \nHowever, considering his successful efforts to resolve two debts, and his rehabilitation of \nhis now-consolidated student loans from a default status to a forbearance status, there \nappears to be reduced financial pressure on him, and with his continued employment, he \nseems to be on the path to eventual financial recovery. There is evidence of a budget. \nThere is evidence of financial counseling in 2011.  \nCharacter References \n \nApplicant\u2019s site manager has known Applicant for the past four years, and \napproximately two years after working together, she promoted him to supervisor status \nwhere he essentially serves as her \u201cright-hand-man.\u201d Applicant is considered to be a very \nhonest and responsible employee, and she feels very comfortable and has confidence \nworking with him. (Attachment 7, dated April 4, 2020, to Response to the FORM) \n \nA coworker has known Applicant for approximately four years, and she considers \nhim to possess very good moral character, integrity, responsibility, and dedication. He is \nalso enthusiastic, cheerful, and very supportive. (Attachment 6, dated April 9, 2020, to \nResponse to the FORM) \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may \nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress \ncan also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR, as amended by the withdrawal of the foreign influence allegations, \nalleged, in addition to the 2012 bankruptcy, 14 delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$66,905, with one delinquent credit-card account in the amount of $2,867, and the \nremaining delinquent accounts, totaling $64,038, characterized as student loans. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been \nunwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not \nbeen established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply, and AG \u00b6 20(a) minimally applies. In addition to his \nperiod of unemployment, Applicant attributed his financial problems to the following \nfactors: he was young and not mature enough to handle his personal finances back then, \nthat he could not handle his finances while in college, and that he did not know how to \nhandle his finances when he was in his 20s. He acknowledged making mistakes in the \npast, but contends that he has learned from his mistakes and is now a different person. \nHe now has a budget as well as a plan to resolve his delinquent debts.  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and \nself-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)). However, in this \ninstance, Applicant commenced his engagement with his creditors, as well as some \npayments under repayment plans, well before the SOR was issued. By the date the record \nclosed, all of his delinquent accounts were either conclusively resolved by Applicant, or \nthey were in the process of being resolved.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant currently appears to be in a better position financially than he had been, \nfor his only substantial continuing debts are his consolidated student loans which are \nunder forbearance under the CARES Act. His actions under the difficult circumstances \nwith which he was confronted, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. He failed \nto exercise sufficient control over his various accounts, even after his earlier delinquent \naccounts were discharged in 2012, and one credit-card account and numerous student \nloans went into default, with one such account becoming a judgment against him.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nHe has been serving in several positions of increased importance with his current \nemployer since September 2014, and he now supervises a staff of 18 individuals. \nAccording to his Agency Director, Applicant is a \u201cmission critical\u201d employee providing \n\u201cessential\u201d federal government services. He previously served as a doorman from May \n2011 until February 2014, and he was unemployed from February 2014 until September \n2014. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. He is unsure if he had been granted a \nsecurity clearance when he took his current job. His financial difficulties arose when he \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nwas in college and in his 20\u2019s, but now that he has matured, he apparently underwent a \nparadigm shift and appears to be a responsible adult. Applicant commenced his \nengagement with his creditors, as well as some payments under repayment plans, well \nbefore the SOR was issued. By the date the record closed, all of his delinquent accounts \nwere either conclusively resolved by Applicant, or they were in the process of being \nresolved.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is fair-to-good and encouraging, commencing \nmeaningful resolution efforts, supported by documentation, well before the SOR was \nissued. By the time the record closed, all of his delinquent accounts were either resolved \nor were in the process of being resolved.  Overall, the evidence leaves me without \nsubstantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.o.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. She married in May 2011 and has a five-year-old daughter, who was born in December 2014. Applicant attended a community college from August 2006 to May 2008 and a state university from January 2009 to May 2013. She has yet to earn a college degree. (Items 3, 7.) She paid for her college classes in part with seven federal student loans obtained for $36,870 between September 2009 and September 2012. (Item 6.) While attending college, Applicant worked at a regional medical center from February 2007 to March 2011; was unemployed and supported by her husband from March 2011 to June 2011; worked at a pet store from June 2011 to October 2011; returned to work for the regional hospital from October 2011 to January 2013; and was employed by a 4 different medical facility from January 2013 until September 2013, when she and her spouse moved to another state. (Items 3, 7.) No information is in the record about Applicant\u2019s income in any of these jobs. Applicant was employed in retail in her new locale from October 2013 to February 2014, when she began working for a defense contractor. On May 26, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a security clearance application (SCA). In response to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed as outstanding debts a $245",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/14/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant defaulted on federal student loans that now total $65,394; on two medical \ndebts totaling $410; and on a $3,008 judgment. While the judgment and medical debts \nhave been paid, and she has a repayment plan for her federal student loans, concerns \nabout her financial situation have not been adequately mitigated. Eligibility for a public trust \nposition is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 5, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \neligibility for a public trust position for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n\n2 \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 10, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 13, 2019, the \nGovernment submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including documents identified \nas Items 1 through 7. The Government forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on \nNovember 18, 2019, and instructed her that any response was due within 30 days of \nreceipt. Applicant received the FORM on December 4, 2019. The January 3, 2020 deadline \nfor her response passed without any response from Applicant. On January 24, 2020, the \ncase was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue a public trust position for Applicant. I received the \ncase file on February 3, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 7, a summary report of a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on June 12, 2015. The summary report was part of \nthe DOD Report of Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, \na DOD ROI may be received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, \nprovided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary \nreport did not bear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary report of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of her opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that she wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows:  \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING GOVERNMENT\u2019S \nEXHIBIT 7: \n \nThe attached summary of your Personal Subject Interview(s) (PSI) is being \nprovided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part of the record \nevidence in this case. In your response to this File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), you can comment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects \nthe information you provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you \ncan make any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to \nmake the summary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you may object on the \nground that the report is unauthenticated by a Government witness. If no \nobjections are raised in your response to this FORM, or if you do not respond \nto this FORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived \n\n3 \n \nany objections to the admissibility of the summary and may consider the \nsummary as evidence in your case. \n  \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. Concerning whether Applicant understood \nthe meaning of authentication or the legal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se \nstatus does not confer any due process rights or protections beyond those afforded her if \nshe was represented by legal counsel. She was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that \nshe may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, she was advised that she is responsible for \npresenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts admitted by her or proven by \nDepartment Counsel and that she has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a \nfavorable trustworthiness decision. While the Directive does not specifically provide for a \nwaiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on sufficient notice of her \nopportunity to object to the admissibility of the PSI summary report, to comment on the PSI \nsummary report, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to the information in \nthe report. According, I found that Applicant waived any objections to the admissibility of \nItem 7. Items 1 through 7 included in the FORM were admitted into the record as exhibits \nfor the Government, subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire \nrecord. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of September 5, 2019, Applicant owed \n$51,817 in federal-loan debt on five accounts in collection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e); two medical \ndebts in collection for $245 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $165 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); and a $3,008 judgment from \nSeptember 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Item 1.) When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she \nadmitted the debts, but indicated that she had established a repayment plan for her federal \nstudent loans, with her first payment to be withdrawn from her bank account on October 4, \n2019, and that she had satisfied the other debts. She provided documentation showing that \nshe paid the medical debts and the judgment debt. (Item 2.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), \nI make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. She married in May 2011 and has a five-year-old daughter, \nwho was born in December 2014. Applicant attended a community college from August \n2006 to May 2008 and a state university from January 2009 to May 2013. She has yet to \nearn a college degree. (Items 3, 7.) She paid for her college classes in part with seven \nfederal student loans obtained for $36,870 between September 2009 and September 2012. \n(Item 6.) \n \nWhile attending college, Applicant worked at a regional medical center from \nFebruary 2007 to March 2011; was unemployed and supported by her husband from March \n2011 to June 2011; worked at a pet store from June 2011 to October 2011; returned to \nwork for the regional hospital from October 2011 to January 2013; and was employed by a \n\n4 \n \ndifferent medical facility from January 2013 until September 2013, when she and her \nspouse moved to another state. (Items 3, 7.) No information is in the record about \nApplicant\u2019s income in any of these jobs. \n  \nApplicant was employed in retail in her new locale from October 2013 to February \n2014, when she began working for a defense contractor. On May 26, 2015, Applicant \ncompleted and certified to the accuracy of a security clearance application (SCA). In \nresponse to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency involving routine accounts, \nApplicant listed as outstanding debts a $245 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f) that she had \nrecently learned was on her credit report, and federal student loans totaling $36,800 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). Applicant explained about her defaulted student loans that her income was \ninsufficient to make monthly payments when the loans first came due in 2013; that \u201clife \nchanges happened;\u201d and that she did not have the money to make payments. Applicant \nindicated that she would pay the collection debt by June 2015 and that she would start \nmaking monthly payments toward her student-loan debts. (Item 3.) She did not specify \nwhen she would start repayment of her student loans. \n \n \nAs of June 4, 2015, Applicant owed past-due balances totaling $45,780 on seven \npast-due federal student- loan accounts, which reportedly had been inactive since March \n2014. She was 90 days past due on an automobile loan obtained for $8,240 in February \n2010 (not alleged), but a joint car loan obtained in March 2014 for $34,206 was being \nrepaid on time at $618 per month. The $245 was a medical debt from August 2013 in \ncollection since January 2015. (Item 6.) \n \n \nOn June 12, 2015, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked about her financial situation, \nApplicant explained that she fell behind on her student loans after she had her daughter \nand was unable to work. She added that the loan servicer was not willing to work with her \non lowering her monthly payments because of her spouse\u2019s income. She lacked recall of \nthe specifics of the seven student loans. She did not recognize the $245 medical debt but \nindicated that she would contact the collection entity holding the debt to arrange for \nrepayment. Applicant was confronted about other debts on her credit report, which had \nbeen settled, and about her delinquent car loan. She explained that she fell behind while on \nmaternity leave, and that she was working to get caught up on the account. Applicant \ndenied any intention of becoming delinquent on any accounts in the future. She attributed \nher financial problems to moving several times, changing jobs, and having a child. \nApplicant reported changes of address in June 2014, November 2014, and June 2015. \n(Item 7.) No information was provided about her and her spouse\u2019s rent at any of these \napartments. \n \n \nIn September 2017, a creditor obtained a $3,008 judgment against Applicant (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h). (Item 4.) Available information does not indicate when the debt became seriously \ndelinquent.  Her joint car loan for $34,206 was paid off according to terms in July 2018. In \nFebruary 2019, Applicant satisfied the judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (Item 2.) It is unclear \nwhether she made installment payments; paid a lump sum; or her wages were garnished to \n\n5 \n \nrepay the judgment.  In June 2019, Applicant paid off the smaller car loan that had been 90 \ndays delinquent in 2015. (Item 4.) \n \n \nAs of July 2019, Equifax was reporting outstanding delinquency totaling $51,817 on \nfive of Applicant\u2019s student-loan accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). Two smaller student loans \ntotaling $2,447 as of June 2015 were no longer on her credit report, although there is no \nevidence they had been paid. Applicant had not paid her $245 medical debt in collection \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). Additionally, a $165 medical debt from January 2018 was in collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g). Applicant had no other past-due debts on her credit record. She was making timely \npayments on a credit card with a $1,472 balance. (Item 5.) \n \n \nOn September 5, 2019, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of her \npast-due federal student loans totaling $51,817 and her two medical collection debts on her \ncredit record as of June 2019. Available address information for Applicant from financial \nstatements shows that sometime between July 2019 and October 2019, Applicant had \nmoved to another state. (Item 2.) She began working at a plant involved in the destruction \nof chemical agents, and was being sponsored for a public trust position. (FORM Receipt.) \n \n \nOn September 27, 2019, the entity collecting Applicant\u2019s defaulted federal student \nloans billed her for an accrued balance of $65,394. Applicant entered into a repayment plan \nto pay $366 per month on the federal student loans. She authorized automatic payments \nfrom her bank account to start on October 4, 2019. On October 7, 2019, Applicant paid \n$245 in full satisfaction of the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. As of October 9, 2019, she had \nauthorized a $182 debit payment from her bank account to satisfy the medical debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g.  When Applicant responded to the SOR on October 10, 2019, Applicant provided \nevidence of her payment arrangement for her student loans and documentation showing \nshe resolved her other debts. (Item 2.) She provided no information about her financial \nsituation, such as her current income and expenses; about the circumstances that led her \nto delay resolving her past-due accounts; or about any financial counseling. \n \n \nIn the Government\u2019s November 13, 2019 FORM, which Applicant received on \nDecember 4, 2019, she was advised that she had the burden to establish mitigation, \nincluding to address concerns about whether she voluntarily repaid the judgment debt, \nwhether she has made monthly payments on her student loans, and whether her financial \nsituation is currently under control. There is no indication that Applicant filed a response to \nthe FORM. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nstandard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available \ninformation, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning the \nperson to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with national security. The Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, dated November \n14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by \nthe Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management. Department of \n\n6 \n \nDefense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the \nDirective before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is \u201can examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a \nnumber of variables\u201d known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. \n \nThe person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. See Executive Order 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 \n18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nAn applicant for a public trust position is not required to be debt free, but is required \nto manage her finances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The \n\n7 \n \nconcern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly compromise \nsensitive information for the money to satisfy her debts. An applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information must be \nconsidered. See e.g., ISCR 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \nApplicant was required to start repaying her student loans in late 2013. She made no \npayments after March 2014. By September 2019, the aggregate balance of her defaulted \nstudent loans had accrued to $65,394. Additionally, a creditor obtained a $3,008 judgment \nagainst Applicant in September 2017. Medical debts of $245 and $165 were placed for \ncollection in January 2015 and June 2018, respectively. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c),\u201d a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d \nare established. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her delinquent debts. Under AG \u00b6 20, the following five mitigating \nconditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant took out the federal student loans between \nSeptember 2009 and September 2012. The medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was likewise \nincurred before she completed her May 2015 SCA. It is unclear when Applicant initially \nincurred the debt that led to the $3,008 judgment in September 2017. The medical debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g became delinquent while Applicant was undergoing consideration for a sensitive \nposition. Even if the debts were incurred some time ago, they are considered recent \n\n8 \n \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).The evidence shows that the student loans and \nmedical debts went unaddressed until September 2019. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant cites lack of income and \u201clife changes\u201d (the birth of her daughter, multiple \nmoves, and changes of jobs) as the causes for her default of her student loans. Insufficient \nincome is a factor that can trigger AG \u00b6 20(b). What can be gleaned from the limited \ninformation of record is that Applicant stopped paying on her federal student loans while \nshe was working for a defense contractor. By the time her income would have been \ncompromised by her maternity leave around late 2014 into early 2015, her student loans \nwere seriously past due. Reported changes of address for Applicant show that she and her \nspouse relocated to a new state in September 2013, and that they then changed \napartments in June 2014, November 2014, and June 2015. She provided no explanation for \nher and her spouse\u2019s multiple moves, and no information about their household income or \nexpenses, to include their rent at each residence. What is known about her and her \nspouse\u2019s financial situation is that they were able to obtain a car loan for $34,206 in March \n2014, and that they made timely payments of $618 monthly on that loan while her student \nloans went unaddressed. The loan servicer for her student loans was not willing to reduce \nher monthly obligation because of her spouse\u2019s income. \n \nEven if the delinquencies were incurred in whole or in part because of circumstances \noutside of Applicant\u2019s control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a responsible \nmanner when dealing with her financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. \nBd. Nov. 29, 2005)). As of her May 2015 SCA, Applicant knew that her student loans were \nin default. Apparently just prior to her SCA, she checked her credit report and found out \nabout the $245 collection debt on her credit record. Applicant indicated that she would pay \noff the medical debt by June 2015, and that she would start making monthly payments on \nher federal student loans. During her June 2015 interview, she told the OPM investigator \nthat she would contact the collection entity for the $245 medical debt after her interview to \narrange for repayment. There is no evidence that she made any attempts to resolve that \nmedical debt or her student loans before late September 2019, more than four years after \nher OPM interview. Applicant did not provide information about her income or expenses \nthat could justify her delay in addressing her known delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(b) is only \nminimally established. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) has some applicability because Applicant satisfied the judgment debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) in early February 2019 and the medical collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.g) in \nlate September and early October 2019, respectively. Favorable findings are returned as to \nthose debts because they have been fully resolved. Even so, the concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness are not fully mitigated. The timing of resolution of financial \nproblems is an important consideration in evaluating mitigation. In ISCR Case No. 17-\n03229 at 6 (App. Bd. June 7, 2019), the Appeal Board stated that \u201can applicant who takes \n\n9 \n \naction to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that his or her \nclearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, and self discipline to follow rules and \nregulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.\u201d  \nApplicant satisfied the judgment before the SOR was issued, but an applicant who resolves \na debt only in response to a court judgment does not display the same good faith as had \nshe arranged to pay or settle the debt voluntarily. There is no evidence that Applicant has \nhad any financial counseling, which is required for full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) and \ncould assuage the trustworthiness concerns raised by her failure to make resolving her \ndelinquencies a priority. AG \u00b6 20(e) is partially established because the evidence does not \nsubstantiate that the judgment debt remained unpaid as of the September 5, 2019 SOR. \n \nAn applicant for a public trust position is not required to establish that he or she has \npaid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, the Appeal Board reiterated \nin ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a \nplan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that \nevidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d Applicant is credited with arranging in late \nSeptember 2019 to make $336 monthly payments toward her federal student loans totaling \n$65,394. She presented no documentation showing that the first payment scheduled for \nOctober 4, 2019, cleared her bank account, or that she made timely monthly payments \nsince October 2019. Moreover, without specific information in the record about her income \nor expenses, it is difficult to conclude that she can be counted on to make timely payments \ntoward her sizeable federal student-loan delinquency. The financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns are not adequately mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, so it was incumbent on her to \nshow that her financial situation is sufficiently stable and not likely to present an ongoing \ntrustworthiness concern. Too many unanswered questions exist about her financial \nsituation. Even assuming that she has made timely payments since October 2019 toward \nher federal student loans, five months of payments are not enough to overcome her years \nof disregard of her obligation to the federal government. Had Applicant not waited until \n\n10 \n \nSeptember 2019 to arrange for repayment of her student loans, she might have been in a \nbetter position to demonstrate the sound financial judgment needed for a public trust \nposition. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the evidence \npresented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a public trust position for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 55 years old. He married in 1984 and divorced in 1995. He has three grown children, ages 32, 33, and 35 years old. He served in the military from 1985 to 2005. Although not disclosed on his August 2015 security clearance application (SCA), he presumably retired with an honorable discharge. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010 and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. He disclosed on his SCA that he has been employed by a federal contractor from March 2006 until the date of the SCA. He disclosed one period of unemployment from October 2005 to February 2006. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he attributed his financial problems to unemployment. Presumably, this unemployment took place sometime after August 2015 when he completed his SCA. Applicant failed to provide the specific period of unemployment, any other information about his finances, or actions he may have taken to resolve his delinquent debts. (Item 2, 3) The SOR alleged four delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,389, and a home foreclosure.

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n02/26/2020 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 20, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 18, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November 6, \n2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant did not submit a timely response. \nThere were no objections by Applicant, and all Items are admitted into evidence. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 14, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He married in 1984 and divorced in 1995. He has three \ngrown children, ages 32, 33, and 35 years old. He served in the military from 1985 to \n2005. Although not disclosed on his August 2015 security clearance application (SCA), \nhe presumably retired with an honorable discharge. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2010 and a master\u2019s degree in 2012. He disclosed on his SCA that he has been \nemployed by a federal contractor from March 2006 until the date of the SCA. He disclosed \none period of unemployment from October 2005 to February 2006. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he attributed his financial problems to \nunemployment. Presumably, this unemployment took place sometime after August 2015 \nwhen he completed his SCA. Applicant failed to provide the specific period of \nunemployment, any other information about his finances, or actions he may have taken \nto resolve his delinquent debts. (Item 2, 3) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent debts totaling approximately $29,389, and a \nhome foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s admissions, credit reports from May 2018 and April 2019, \nand court documents corroborated the delinquent accounts and foreclosure. (Items 2, 3, \n4, 5, 6) \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($27,521) is for a car loan. Applicant stated in his SOR \nanswer that he contacted the creditor after he became unemployed and advised them he \nwas unable to make the monthly payments. He asked the creditor for the car to be \nrepossessed, which it was. He did not provide any other information about his attempt to \nresolve this delinquent debt or whether he intended to pay it. (Items 2, 4, 5)  \n \n \nRegarding the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($902) and \u00b6 1.d ($467), \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he believed he had paid the final bills to \nthe creditors, and he intended to contact them to make \u201csuitable payment arrangements \nuntil full restitution is completed.\u201d (Item 2) Applicant did not provide documentary evidence \nthat he has resolved these debts.  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is for expenses associated with Applicant\u2019s online \neducation. He stated in his answer to the SOR that he disputed the account with the \ncreditor. He had attended a class, but had to take an extended leave of absence. His \nfinancial aid was returned and the balance is what is owed. Applicant stated in his SOR \nanswer that he would contact the creditor to make \u201csuitable payment arrangements until \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfull restitution is completed.\u201d (Item 2) Applicant did not provide documentary evidence of \nactions that he has resolved this debt.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer that his home was foreclosed due to his loss \nof employment. He said he made every attempt to honor his responsibilities, but due to \nhis unemployment he was unable to do so. He stated he was not proud of his credit file, \nbut it is not a true description of his character. He is working diligently to correct it. (Item \n2) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that began to accrue around 2016 that are not \nresolved. His home was foreclosed the same year. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the alleged debts. He failed to provide evidence that he \nhas taken action to pay or resolve any of the debts. He attributed his financial problems \nto unemployment, but did not provide amplifying information as to when it began; the \ncircumstances around why he lost his job; whether he is now employed; his current \nfinances; and what actions he has taken to resolve his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s debts \nremain unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s unemployment may have been \nbeyond his control, but there is insufficient evidence to apply AG \u00b6 20(b) without evidence \nof the circumstances surrounding it. However, even if Applicant is given the benefit of the \ndoubt, he failed to show he acted responsibly by contacting the creditors and making \npayment arrangements to resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He retired from the military in 2005. He was employed \nby federal contractors from 2006 until at least August 2015, the date of his SCA. He \nattributed his financial problems to unemployment, but failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to substantiate his inability to repay his debts or any action he has taken to \nresolve them. He stated he intended to pay the smaller debts, but failed to provide \nevidence that he has done so. He did not make any statement about whether he intended \nto pay the large debt for his repossessed car. Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 13, 2018. \nOn September 20, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative \ndecisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 23, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \n\n \n2 \n \nnotice of hearing on December 12, 2019, and the hearing was convened on January 16, \n2020. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted no additional evidence. The record was held \nopen to permit submission of additional documentary evidence, but nothing was \nsubmitted within the allotted time period. DOHA received the hearing transcript on \nJanuary 29, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old fuel systems mechanic for a defense contractor, \nemployed since 2018. He graduated from high school in 1981. He served on active duty \nin the United States Navy from 1981 until he was honorably discharged in 1984. He \nmarried in 1986 and divorced in 1996. He again married in 2009 and divorced in 2019. \nHe remarried in March 2019. He has one adult child, and his current spouse has three \nchildren. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $36,000 in delinquent debt. He \nadmitted all of the SOR allegations. Applicant testified that his debts arose from bad \nchoices, travel expenses, and his spouse\u2019s spending.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a loan on a vehicle that was voluntarily repossessed. He received a \ncollection notice prior to the hearing, but no contact with the creditor has been made. The \ndebt remains unresolved. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are delinquent vehicle loans. Applicant was \nnot aware of when the loans became delinquent and their current status. He has had no \ncontact with the creditors and the debts remain unresolved. SOR \u00b6 1.d is a delinquent \npersonal loan that Applicant thought was paid. However, he has not had contact with the \ncreditor, nor does he know its current status. The debt remains unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.m include delinquent credit cards, utility debts, personal \nloans, and medical debts that remain unresolved. Applicant has not made contact with \ncreditors to inquire into the current status of the debts or attempt to resolve them. \n \nApplicant was laid off in 1998, and remained underemployed until 2010. He is \ncurrently paying his ex-spouse\u2019s car loan and insurance because she cannot afford it. He \nbelieves that since his last divorce, he is able to start saving about $1,000 per month \nbecause he is moving to a lower-cost home. He has about $1,025 in his bank accounts, \nand $700 in a 401K retirement savings program. He has not pursued financial counseling \nor assistance with debt management.  \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n3 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that remain unresolved. The \ndebts appear to have resulted from a long period of underemployment, as well as divorces \nand irresponsible spending. Applicant has not shown sufficient efforts to resolve his \ndelinquent debts and there is insufficient evidence to show that the debts will be resolved.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial status has been poor for some time, and there is insufficient evidence \nthat it will improve in the near future. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial status raise significant \ndoubts about his financial management decisions, personal responsibility, and ability to \naddress delinquent debts. I am not convinced Applicant makes good financial decisions, \nand his financial status continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. No mitigating condition fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 3, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On August 28, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn November 4, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she elected to have \nher case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2)  A complete copy of \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on December 19, 2019, and she was \nafforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to her case. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 6, 2020. Her response was due on February 5, \n2020. Applicant timely submitted a four-page statement to the FORM with 13 attachments \nwhich were accepted without objection. The case was assigned to me on February 21, \n2020. The record closed on February 21, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant denied, with very brief comments, all of the \nSOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.). \nApplicant\u2019s comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of \nthe evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a technical publications delivery specialist with her current employer since September \n2018. She has a blemished employment history involving voluntary and involuntary \nterminations separated by periods of unemployment: she had full-time employment as an \nappliance manager for a major retailer from November 2006 until April 2011, when she \nwas fired; was unemployed from April 2011 until September 2011; had full-time \nemployment as an assistant branch manager and eventually branch manager for a \nfinance company from September 2011 until April 2017, when she voluntarily quit \nbecause of her brother\u2019s death; was unemployed from April 2017 until September 2017; \nhad full-time employment as a security officer from September 2017 until November 2017, \nwhen she voluntarily quit because she was made to feel old; was unemployed from \nDecember 2017 until January 2018; had full-time employment as a credit counselor from \nJanuary 2018 until April 2018, when she quit because of a \u201clack of leadership\u201d; and was \nself-employed as an independent contractor from May 2018 until September 2018. (Item \n3, at 15-22)   \n \nA 1977 high school graduate, Applicant earned additional credits from a university \nbut no degree. She has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security \nclearance. She was married in 1983, and divorced in 1987. She remarried in 2001, and \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ndivorced in 2016. She has two adult children from her first marriage, born in 1983, and \n1985. \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated April 17, 2019); Item 3 (SF 86, dated April 3, 2019); Item 4 \n(Enhanced Subject Interview, dated June 7, 2018); Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, \ndated November 4, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, dated February 4, \n2020, with relevant attachments).  \nApplicant reported her periods of unemployment, but she did not specifically \ninclude them as factors that led to her financial problems. Instead, she attributed those \nproblems to the following factors: her creditors kept increasing her credit limits on her \naccounts that had been open for over ten years; because she was unable to assist her \nchildren with the costs of their education, she opened some accounts to assist them with \nthe purchase of their homes; for most of her life she worked in jobs that did not pay \u201cgreat,\u201d \nbut gave her the flexibility to put her children first; she became overconfident as to her \nfinancial abilities; her brother passed away in January 2017; because her brother left no \nlast will and testament, she was named the administrator of his estate, requiring flexibility \nto handle the varied requirements of being an administrator; as the estate administrator, \nshe engaged in a two-year legal battle with her brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; and Applicant quit her \njob and cashed in her 401k to spend significant time to perform her duties as \nadministrator.  (Response to the FORM) Another possible factor was that at one \nunspecified point, her ex-husband, the father of her two children, had child-support \narrearages of over $200,000, and his social security was garnished. (Item 3, at 25) It is \nunclear if those arrearages have been resolved. \nIn her SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having four delinquent accounts. (Item 3 at \n46-52) She also acknowledged that she had taken \u201cseveral\u201d Caribbean cruises, but only \nidentified one such cruise from 2015. (Item 3, at 35-41) When she was interviewed by an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on May 2, 2019, \nApplicant initially contended that all of her accounts were paid in full and current. She was \nconfronted with a number of delinquent accounts, and claimed to be unaware that several \nof those identified were her accounts or that several of the other accounts were \ndelinquent. She discussed various accounts, and she denied having more than one \naccount with one particular creditor, although three separate accounts were revealed. \nShe later acknowledged that after her brother passed away, she stopped making \npayments on all accounts but for her car and a bed. She admitted that she willingly \n\u201cprioritized her family\u201d \u2013 over her bills. She felt that it was a one-time situation, and that \nshe got overwhelmed when everything got out of control. She claimed that she was \nworking on paying off her debt. She promised to resolve her debts if she is satisfied that \nthey are her debts and she has the means to pay them. When given the opportunity to \nfurnish the investigator with documents associated with her financial debts, she indicated \nthat she had no such documents. (Item 4, at 4)  \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nIn November 2016, Applicant made an initial contact with a law firm to discuss the \npossibility of filing for bankruptcy. No other contacts were made until October 1, 2019 \u2013 \none month after the SOR was issued. (Letter, dated January 27, 2020, attached to \nApplicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) On November 4, 2019, Applicant filed a petition for \nbankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, listing $50,765 in debts. \nAlthough the bankruptcy trustee report had been filed in December 2019, no decision by \nthe bankruptcy judge regarding discharge of any debts had been made by the time the \nrecord closed. (Item 6 (Bankruptcy History)) \n The SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $29,338, set \nforth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $7,501 that \nwas placed for collection and charged off in April 2017 (Item 5, at 6; Item 4, at 4). SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. is an unsecured loan with an unpaid balance of $4,054 that was placed for collection \nand charged off in April 2017. The unpaid balance increased to $4,488 as of July 2018. \n(Item 5, at 6; Item 4, at 4; Letter, dated July 30, 2018, attached to Applicant\u2019s Response \nto the FORM). SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a credit-card account with a past due and unpaid balance of \n$3,315 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 6; Item 4, \nat 1; Item 3, at 47-48) SOR \u00b6 1.d. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance \nof $2,619 that was placed for collection and charged off in May 2017. The unpaid balance \nincreased to $3,089 as of July 2018. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 4; Letter, dated July 30, 2018, \nattached to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM) SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a credit-card account with \na past due and unpaid balance of $3,188. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 4) SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a credit-\ncard account with a past due and unpaid balance of $2,149 that was placed for collection. \n(Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 4) SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a charge account with an unpaid balance of $325 \nthat was placed for collection and charged off in May 2017. (Item 5, at 7; Item 4, at 1-2; \nItem 3, at 49-50) SOR \u00b6 1.h. is a cable account for which equipment was not returned \nleaving an unpaid balance of $187 that was placed for collection. (Item 5, at 11; Item 4, \nat 2, 4; Item 3, at 50) SOR \u00b6 1.i. is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance \nof approximately $6,000. (Item 3, at 48-49; Item 4, at 1) Although Applicant contends that \nher financial problems started in January 2017, a review of her credit report reveals that \nher delinquent accounts started experiencing late or non-payments as early as October-\nNovember 2016. \nOther than Applicant\u2019s 2016 initial contact with her bankruptcy attorney, and her \nJuly 2018 inquiry of a creditor as to the status of three of her delinquent accounts, which \nhave been confirmed by documents, she has offered only unverified contentions \nregarding her efforts to resolve the remaining delinquent accounts, for there is no \ndocumentary evidence, such as repayment plans, cancelled checks, bank account \nregisters, receipts from creditors, or other material correspondence between her and her \ncreditors to support her positions. On November 4, 2019, she denied that all of the \naccounts alleged in the SOR remained delinquent. That denial was false, for while she \nmay have filed her petition for bankruptcy on that date, the simple filing of a bankruptcy \npetition does not automatically eliminate the standing account delinquencies.  \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because she \ndid not report her current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly \nremainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nevidence of a budget. There is evidence of financial counseling associated with the filing \nfor bankruptcy. In the absence of additional financial information, it remains difficult to \ndetermine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been, or if \nher focus on her family\u2019s financial desires are still given priority over her own finances.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant has nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $29,338. Several of \nthose debts became delinquent as early as October or November 2016, and by the time \nthe record closed in February 2020, none of them had been addressed by contacts with \ncreditors or efforts to enter into payments of any amount. Instead, on the same day that \nshe submitted her Answer to the SOR \u2013 about one month after the SOR was issued \u2013  \nher attorney filed for bankruptcy on her behalf under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode. That bankruptcy still has not been resolved. Applicant acknowledged that when it \ncame time for her to address her various accounts, she prioritized her family over her \nbills. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. Because she prioritized her family \ndesires, not necessarily their needs, it appears that Applicant simply diverted her \navailable funds to her family\u2019s desires, and was unwilling to satisfy her debts regardless \nof an ability to do so. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 19(b) has also been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all minimally apply, but AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to a cornucopia of factors: her creditors kept \nincreasing her credit limits on her accounts that had been open for over ten years; \nbecause she was unable to assist her children with the costs of their education, she \nopened some accounts to assist them with the purchase of their homes; for most of her \nlife she worked in jobs that did not pay \u201cgreat,\u201d but gave her the flexibility to put her \nchildren first; she became overconfident as to her financial abilities; her brother passed \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \naway in January 2017; because her brother left no last will and testament, she was named \nthe administrator of his estate, requiring flexibility to handle the varied requirements of \nbeing an administrator; as the estate administrator, she engaged in a two-year legal battle \nwith her brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e; and Applicant quit her job and cashed in her 401k to spend \nsignificant time to perform her duties as administrator.  Applicant acknowledged that \nflexibility was a priority for her employment, so that she could spend more time with her \nchildren, at the same time voluntarily working in lower-paying positions to maintain that \nflexibility. Her intentions have resulted in a blemished employment history involving \nvoluntary and involuntary terminations separated by periods of unemployment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s involuntary loss of employment and the unexpected death of her \nbrother were clearly conditions that were largely beyond her control. Her repeated \nvoluntary quitting of jobs that resulted in periods of unemployment; taking advantage of \nincreased credit limits from creditors; prioritizing family desires over maintaining her \naccounts in a current status; and allowing accounts to become delinquent in late 2016 \u2013 \nmonths before the unexpected death of her brother in January 2017 \u2013 were not largely \nbeyond her control. The significant factor that cannot be overlooked is when the issues \narose over which she had little control, did she act responsibly under the circumstances. \nA \u201cmaybe\u201d response, without substantial explanations by Applicant, is insufficient to \nsupport such a decision. While bankruptcy is a legal means of liquidating past debts, the \nsignificance of the bankruptcy proceeding depends on what the bankruptcy shows about \nan individual\u2019s judgment and reliability in dealing with financial obligations. The cause of \nthe financial problems and what efforts the individual made to solve the problems short \nof bankruptcy are more significant than the amount of the debt. Essentially ignoring her \ndelinquent accounts, including two relatively minor accounts with unpaid balances of $187 \nand $325, until after she received the SOR, Applicant\u2019s first real effort to address them \noccurred on the same date that she filed her petition for bankruptcy. \n  \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties, \nand her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve her delinquent accounts for several years, \nis sufficient to conclude that her financial difficulties were not infrequent and they are likely \nto remain unchanged. Applicant completed her SF 86 in April 2019; underwent her OPM \ninterview in May 2019, when she was offered the opportunity to submit documentation \nregarding her delinquent accounts; and the SOR was issued in August 2019. Each step \nof the security clearance review process placed her on notice of the significance of the \nfinancial issues confronting her. In May 2019, she promised to resolve her debts if she is \nsatisfied that they are her debts and she has the means to pay them. As of the closing of \nthe record, other than filing for bankruptcy, she has taken no actions to address, much \nless resolve, any of her delinquent accounts.  \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment and \nself-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)).  \n \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n \nFurthermore, Applicant filed for bankruptcy on November 4, 2019, and, as of the \ndate the record of this security clearance eligibility process closed, there has not yet been \na decision as to whether or not the bankruptcy judge will discharge her debts. In the \nabsence of the potential bankruptcy discharge, and any period following that potential \ndischarge, it is simply too recent for Applicant to establish a track record of debt resolution, \nor to determine her post-bankruptcy behavior. In the absence of Applicant\u2019s current net \nmonthly income; monthly expenses; any monthly remainder that might be available for \ndiscretionary spending or savings; evidence of a budget; or positive activity by Applicant, \nother than her filing for bankruptcy, it remains difficult to determine if she is currently in a \nbetter position financially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, delayed action, or \ninaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010); see \nalso ISCR Case No. 18-01762 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 26, 2019) \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \ntechnical publications delivery specialist with her current employer since September \n2018. A 1977 high school graduate, Applicant earned additional credits from a university \nbut no degree. On November 4, 2019, Applicant filed a petition for bankruptcy under \nChapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, listing $50,765 in debts. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant has nine delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $29,338. Several of those debts became delinquent as early as October \nor November 2016, and by the time the record closed in February 2020, none of them \nhad been addressed by contacts with creditors or efforts to enter into payments of any \namount. Instead, on the same day that she submitted her Answer to the SOR \u2013 about \none month after the SOR was issued \u2013 her attorney filed for bankruptcy on her behalf \nunder Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. That bankruptcy still has not been \nresolved. Her repeated voluntary quitting of jobs that resulted in periods of \nunemployment; taking advantage of increased credit limits from creditors; prioritizing \nfamily desires over maintaining her accounts in a current status; and allowing accounts \nto become delinquent in late 2016 \u2013 months before the unexpected death of her brother \nin January 2017 \u2013 were not largely beyond her control. In addition, taking Caribbean \ncruises instead of paying one\u2019s bills is not a positive characteristic of an individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is abysmal at best, delaying any resolution efforts \n\u2013 filing for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \u2013 until the day she \nanswered the SOR. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Connelley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n02/11/2020\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 20, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a set of interrogatories to him. \nHe answered those interrogatories on August 22, 2019. On October 4, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated October 23, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on November 26, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 \ndays, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the \nAdjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on \nDecember 3, 2019. His response was due on January 2, 2020. Applicant chose not to \nrespond to the FORM, for as of January 29, 2020, no response had been received. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 29, 2020. The record closed on January 29, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without any comments, the factual \nallegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and \npersonal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and \nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a rigger with his current employer since February 2019. He previously served in a \nvariety of relatively short-term positions with other employers such as an account \nmanager, part-time security guard, dock supervisor, sanitation manager, and inventory \nmanager. He is a 1993 high school graduate, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. \nHe has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security \nclearance. Applicant was married in 1999. He has three children, born in 2000, 2002, and \n2012. \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance. He used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from about 1994 until at least May 2019, for a period of over two and one-half \ndecades. He reported that he initially took a few puffs of a marijuana cigarette provided \nto him at a college party out of curiosity. Thereafter, on approximately nine or ten \noccasions, he smoked marijuana in cigarettes or a pipe with an identified friend (who was \na listed reference) and other unidentified individuals. He smoked marijuana at golf \ntournaments in 2018 and as recently as May 2019. He does not recall who furnished him \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nthe marijuana he smoked. Using marijuana caused him to feel tired. He has never \nreceived any counselling or treatment for his use of marijuana. In July 2019, he claimed \nhe had no intention of using marijuana in the future. (Item 3 \u2013 Triggered Enhanced Subject \nInterview, dated July 9, 2019, at 4-5) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nOn February 20, 2019, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to \ncertain questions pertaining to his illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 \n\u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity. The most significant questions, and the ones \nalleged in the SOR, were essentially as follows:  \n \nApplicant was asked if, in the last seven (7) years, he had illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances. Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question, and he added that he \nhad smoked marijuana twice with friends in May 2015 and April 2018. He omitted his \nother marijuana use. The follow-up question was if he intended to use any illegal drugs in \nthe future, and he responded: \u201cNo\u201d and he added \u201cI did not enjoy its effects, I do not wish \nto spend money on it, I . . . feel using illegal drugs will not be beneficial to my career.\u201d \n(Item 2 \u2013 SF 86, dated February 20, 2019, at 39-40) His declared future intentions were \nfalse because he continued using marijuana after he submitted the SF 86. He certified \nthat his responses to those questions were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his \nknowledge and belief. In fact, because of his omissions and concealments, the responses \nto those questions were, in fact, false.  \n \n \nOn March 6, 2019, Applicant underwent an interview with an investigator from the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In response to inquiries regarding his \ninvolvement with illegal drugs, Applicant presented a more thorough history of his drug \ninvolvement. He also explained that a significant portion of his history of drug involvement \nwas omitted because he did not want his employer to know about his actual use of \nmarijuana. (Item 3, at 5)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes some conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He possessed and \nused marijuana, a controlled substance, with varying frequency, on nine or ten occasions \nduring a period of over two and one-half decades, reportedly ending as recently as May \n2019. He claimed that he generally used marijuana at parties or when he was at golf \ntournaments with others who were also smoking it. AG \u00b6 25(a) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nNeither condition applies. Applicant used marijuana for over two and one-half \ndecades, reportedly ending as recently as May 2019. There was nothing infrequent about \nhis marijuana use, and there is no evidence to indicate that it happened under such \ncircumstances that it was unlikely to recur. In fact, even after he acknowledged in his SF \n86 that he had used it on only two earlier occasions, he continued using marijuana for \nseveral more months. While he now acknowledges his past drug involvement, he has \nactually been abstinent for only a mere eight months. Also, although he now claims to \nhave no intention of future drug involvement, he stated the same intention in his February \n2019 SF 86, and he broke that pledge with continued marijuana use.  \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, after over two and one-half decades of marijuana use, the most recent \ndrug involvement and substance misuse was in May 2019.  Continued abstinence is to \nbe encouraged, but the relatively brief period of such abstinence is in stark contrast to the \nlengthy decades-old period of marijuana use, and is considered insufficient to conclude \nthat the abstinence will continue. Given Applicant\u2019s cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, \nand regulations, his use of marijuana, despite knowing that such use was prohibited by \nboth the Government and his employer, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \n\n7 \n                                      \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his SF 86 in February 2019, he merely \nacknowledged two incidents of marijuana use, and he intentionally concealed any \nreferences to his far more lengthy history of drug involvement and substance misuse. \nWhen he was subsequently interviewed by an OPM investigator, he finally opened up \nabout the truth of his lengthy history of marijuana use. He explained that he was \nessentially fearful that such information might have a negative impact on his employment, \nso he did not want his employer to know about his actual use of marijuana.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions of the SOR \nallegations. Applicant did not controvert the falsification allegations. In other words, he \nintentionally concealed much of his substance misuse and falsified his responses. As to \nthe deliberate falsifications on the 2019 SF 86 regarding his drug activity, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nand 16(e) have been established. With respect to Applicant\u2019s continued use of marijuana \nafter he declared an intention not to do so, AG \u00b6 16(e) has been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s false responses to the SF 86 inquiries \noccurred in February 2019, and he finally told the truth to the OPM investigator in July \n2019. Before that interview, he made no efforts to correct the omissions, concealments, \nor falsifications associated with his SF 86. Applicant\u2019s refusal to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations, as well as with employment rules and policies, lasted over two and one-\nhalf decades. Despite his claimed new compliance with all of the above, Applicant\u2019s \nactions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 45-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a rigger with his current \nemployer since February 2019. He previously served in a variety of relatively short-term \npositions with other employers. He is a 1993 high school graduate, and received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. He finally confessed to the OPM investigator in July 2019 that \nhe had previously used marijuana more often than he had previously reported in his SF \n86; that he has not used marijuana since May 2019; and that he no longer intends to use \nit in the future. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant used marijuana, a controlled substance, with varying frequency, from about \n1994 until at least May 2019, generally at parties or when he was at golf tournaments with \nothers who were also smoking it. When he completed his SF 86, he reported that he had \nused marijuana on only two occasions, and that he had no intentions of using it in the \nfuture. However, he continued using marijuana for several more months. While he now \nacknowledges his past drug involvement, he has been abstinent for only a mere eight \nmonths. Although he now claims to have no intention of future drug involvement, he stated \nthat same intention in February 2019, and he broke that pledge with continued marijuana \nuse. Thus, the significance of that newer pledge is greatly reduced. Applicant has never \nreceived treatment and counseling as a result of his illegal use of controlled substances.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse; and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n__________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Schachter, Esq. \n01/24/2020 \nDecision \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 3, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on October 19, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 9, \n2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on January 9, 2020.  \n \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1 was admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified, called four witnesses, and submitted 56 documents marked and admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through O-2.  \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about India. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the \nfacts contained in the requests. The facts are summarized in the written requests and \ndocuments and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that \nIndia is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works closely with the United States on many \nmatters, shares common strategic interests, and generally respects the rights of its \ncitizens. But it also continues to have human rights problems; it has been victimized by \nterrorist attacks; and restricted, dual-use technology has been illegally exported to India.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old independent contractor and consultant. He is applying \nfor a security clearance for the first time. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from an Indian \nuniversity and a master\u2019s degree from an American university.

His mother \nand three of his siblings immigrated to the United States before Applicant. He followed \nthem to the United States in 1997, and he became a U.S. citizen in 2003. India does not \npermit dual citizenship, and he renounced his Indian citizenship when he became a U.S. \ncitizen. His wife is originally from India. She is now a U.S. citizen. Their child was born \nin the United States. (Tr. at 17-18, 22, 36, 49-50, 56; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and three of his six siblings are U.S. citizens and residents. \nTwo of his sisters lived in the United States and had permanent residence status (green \ncard), but have moved back to India. One of his brothers and his mother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of India. His father-in-law is deceased.

They have since divested themselves \nof the properties. They have substantial assets in the United States, including their \nhome, which they own without a mortgage, and three investment properties. He \nestimated their net worth to be between $1.2 and $1.5 million. (Tr. at 23-26, 39-40, 48-\n49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE F-J, L) \n \n \n \nApplicant has no plan to move back to India. His family has enjoyed great \nsuccess in the United States. It includes doctors, lawyers, and engineers, with \ngraduates from some of the most prestigious universities in the United States. His child \nis in a medical program at a top university. Applicant expressed his undivided allegiance \n\n \n3 \n \nto the United States, which he considers his home. He credibly testified that his family in \nIndia could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information, \nand that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. at 19-20, 32-34, 52-53; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant is active in his community. Four witnesses testified on his behalf, and \nhe submitted numerous documents and letters attesting to his civic involvement, \npatriotism, strong moral character, trustworthiness, honesty, dependability, work ethic, \ndedication, and integrity. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C, D) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n4 \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant has family members, including three siblings and his mother-in-law, \nwho are citizens and residents of India. India is the world\u2019s largest democracy, works \nclosely with the United States on many matters, shares common strategic interests, and \ngenerally respects the rights of its citizens. But it also continues to have human rights \nproblems; it has been victimized by terrorist attacks; and restricted, dual-use technology \nhas been illegally exported to India. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and through his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), and 7(e) and have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nApplicant no longer owns any property in India. AG \u00b6 7(f) is not applicable. SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.f are concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to India. Guideline B is not limited to \ncountries hostile to the United States. The United States has a compelling interest in \nprotecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made \nwith caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of \n\n \n6 \n \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. He has many family members who live in the \nUnited States, but he still has some family in India. None of his immediate family \nmembers have any current direct connection to the Indian government. Applicant and \nhis wife gave up their Indian citizenships when they became U.S. citizens. He has no \nplan to move back to India. He expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, \nwhich he considers his home. He credibly testified that his family in India could not be \nused to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he would \nreport any attempt to do so. \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to India are outweighed by his deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States. His closest family, life, home, assets, \nand professional career are in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States and the \ninterests of India. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s ties to family \nmembers residing in, and who are citizens of, China are not mitigated. His request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 16, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n  \n \nOn August 28, 2019, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns articulated in the adjudicative guidelines (AG) issued by the \nDirector of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Specifically, this case is governed by Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on December 4, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on January \n28, 2020. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2. Appellant \nappeared as scheduled, testified, and proffered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B. All exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. Department Counsel also submitted three administrative \nexhibits included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 (Index of Government Exhibits, \none page), HX 2 (Department Counsel Discovery Letter, dated November 27, 2019, two \npages), and HX 3 (Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice re People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, dated December 26, 2019 (11 pages). With HX 3, Department Counsel \nincluded 22 exhibits (Items I \u2013 XXII) in support of the request for administrative notice. I \nreceived a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 6, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident \nof China who works there as a police officer (SOR 1.a), and that his step-mother (SOR \n1.b) and half-sister (SOR 1.c) are citizens and residents of China. It was also alleged that \nApplicant maintains contact with his cousin, who is a citizen and resident of China and \nserved in the Chinese military (SOR 1.d). Finally, it was alleged that Applicant maintains \ncontact with an uncle and two aunts, one of whom works for the Chinese government, \nwho are citizens and residents of China (SOR 1.e). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted without explanation all of the SOR \nallegations. In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old and employed as an engineer for a large defense \ncontractor. He was born in China, immigrated to the United States in 2008, and became \na U.S. citizen in 2014. His parents, both native-born Chinese citizens, divorced in 2007. \nHis mother subsequently married an American, now Applicant\u2019s stepfather, whom she \nmet when he was on vacation in China. Applicant and his mother subsequently moved to \nthe United States where Applicant completed his middle and high school education. \nApplicant went on to earn an associate\u2019s degree at a community college. Thereafter, he \nenrolled in a state university where he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree with two engineering \nmajors in 2017. In 2019, he earned a master\u2019s degree in engineering. He began working \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nfor his current employer during his last semester in college as an engineering intern, \nbefore being hired in May 2017 as a full-time employee. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 14, 32 \u2013 33) \n \n \nApplicant is single and lives with other single professionals his age. He owns a 14-\nyear-old used car and earns about $70,000 annually. He has about $22,000 saved in a \nretirement savings account. He has no assets or other interests in China or any other \nforeign country. His father in China helped pay for about 30 percent of Applicant\u2019s \neducation. The rest was funded by his mother and American stepfather. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. \n32 \u2013 34, 48 \u2013 50) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father has lived in China his entire life. He served in the Chinese \nPeople\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) for about 15 years before transitioning to his current job \nas a civilian police officer in one of China\u2019s southern provinces. He has worked as a \npoliceman since about 2007. Applicant\u2019s father has remarried and now has an 11-year-\nold daughter (Applicant\u2019s half-sister). Applicant\u2019s Chinese stepmother owns a private \ncompany that manufactures batteries for electric cars. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 32, 37, 56 \u2013 57) \n \n \nApplicant maintains close and continuing contact with his father in China. Most of \ntheir communication takes place weekly via text. He last visited his father for about a \nmonth in December 2016 and January 2017. Before then, he visited his father and other \nfamily members in China for about six weeks in May and June 2015. He hopes to visit his \nfather in the future, but he understands that if he holds a clearance such travel would \nraise additional security concerns. (GX 1; Tr. 41 \u2013 46, 59 \u2013 60) \n \n \nApplicant also maintains regular contact with two aunts and one uncle who are \nChinese citizens and reside in China. One of his aunts (his mother\u2019s sister) works for the \nChinese government\u2019s provincial agricultural commission. Applicant speaks or \nelectronically messages with her about four times annually. Applicant also stays in regular \ncontact a cousin, the son of the aforementioned maternal aunt, whom Applicant regards \nas a brother because they are about the same age. He and his cousin communicate by \ntext about once each month. His cousin served in the PLA as part of a two-year \ncompulsory service obligation. While in the Chinese military, Applicant\u2019s cousin served in \na forestry division. He now works at the factory owned by Applicant\u2019s stepmother. (GX 1; \nTr. 37 \u2013 39) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other aunt, his father\u2019s sister, and his uncle (by marriage to this aunt) \nwork for the Chinese government\u2019s forestry and water commission. Applicant has \nelectronic contact with them about four times annually. Applicant last saw his aunts, his \nuncle, and his cousin, as well as other family members with whom he has no contact, \nwhen he visited his father in early 2017. His last contact with any family member other \nthan his father was in mid-2019. He last spoke with his father in late January 2020. (GX \n1; Tr. 39 \u2013 41) \n  \n \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding China. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nChina is an increasingly industrialized world economic and military power. The country \nhas a population in excess of one billion people who are governed by an authoritarian, \nCommunist regime. Geographically vast and demographically diverse, the country has \nsignificant natural resources to help support its growing economy. China devotes most of \nits industry and domestic production to its military forces, and it has a strategic nuclear \narsenal. China is in direct competition with the United States in many geopolitical and \neconomic areas, and it is known to actively collect military, economic and industrial \ninformation about the United States. In addition to being the leading threat to the security \nof U.S. technology, China of late has emerged as a persistent cyber espionage threat to \nU.S. military and critical infrastructure systems. Much of that activity is conducted through \nthe auspices of the PLA. (Hx. 3, Items I - V) \n \n \nChina and the U.S. also are major trading partners and share other common \ninterests. For example, the two countries have worked closely on regional issues, \nespecially those involving North Korea. However, China is one of the most active \ncollectors of U.S. defense information and technology, as evidenced by multiple federal \nprosecutions of U.S. citizens attempting to act illegally on behalf of the Chinese \ngovernment in the United States. Further, the Chinese government has an abysmal \nhuman rights record. Officials continue to engage in suppression of personal and \nelectronic expressions of political dissent. Arbitrary arrest and detention, forced \nconfessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment are commonplace. Government \nand law enforcement practices are largely unchecked by any independent judicial review. \nMost recently, the central Chines government has begun to exert a repressive influence \nin Hong Kong, a historically open society. (Hx. 3, Item I, VII) \n \n \nApplicant is loyal to the United States and unequivocally favors western democratic \ngovernment, with its system of individual liberties and freedom of speech, over the \nrepressive, authoritarian regime in China. He testified that if any of his family members \nwere ever put under duress to leverage Applicant\u2019s access to classified information, he \nwould contact his employer\u2019s security organization. Applicant also presented information \nshowing that his life is one of total immersion in personal and professional interests in \nUnited States. Applicant was a good student of whom his father, mother, and stepmother \nare rightfully proud. He is assumed to be a good employee, and he has a variety of \npersonal interests that are typical of any American citizen his age. (AX A; AX B; Tr. 58 \u2013 \n60) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nApplicant has continuing relationships with his father, his stepmother, his father\u2019s \nsister and her husband, their son, and his mother\u2019s sister. Although he has not seen any \nof those relatives in three years, he is in regular electronic contact with them. He and his \nfather last communicated less than a week before the hearing. All of these relationships \nare, by definition, close even if the nature of their communications may often be casual. \nCombined with information about China and its relationship with the United States that is \nnot reasonably subject to dispute, the record evidence as a whole requires application of \nthe disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a): \n \ncontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nNonetheless, I conclude none of these factors can be applied here. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships are not casual and his communications with them are not infrequent. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the United States and his ties in this country are \nsignificant, that information is not sufficient to outweigh the heightened risk of coercion \npresented by the Chinese government. The security concerns about foreign influence are \nnot mitigated. \n \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). It cannot be disputed that Applicant is a loyal American citizen, and that he lives a \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \ntypically American lifestyle in all facets of his life. On its face, the fact that Applicant has \nrelatives in China is perfectly normal and would not warrant any unusual scrutiny. In the \ncontext of assessing an individual\u2019s suitability for access to classified information, \nhowever, his circumstances must be examined with the protection of the national interest \nin mind. These decisions are a recognition of the heightened risks associated with \nApplicant\u2019s close ties of affection for persons who reside in a country known to exploit \nthose relationships to the detriment of the United States. Although Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances are not of his own doing, the nature of China\u2019s government and its often \nadversarial approach to the United States sustain doubts about the suitability of granting \nApplicant access to classified information. Because protection of the interests of national \nsecurity is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to \nhave access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n                                       \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated foreign influence concerns relating to his connections to South \nKorea. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 26, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the foreign influence guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant responded to the SOR on March 14, 2020, and initially requested a \ndecision based on the administrative record. At the request of Applicant\u2019s counsel on \nJune 22, 2020, the case was converted to a hearing proceeding. A hearing was \nscheduled for August 21, 2020, and heard on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of one exhibit (GE).  Applicant relied on ten exhibits and \none witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 2, 2020.  \n \nBesides its evidentiary exhibit, the Government requested administrative notice \nof facts contained in 12 attachments related to the country of South Korea. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004). \nAdministrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well \nknown.

(GE \n1; Tr. 21, 35) His spouse was born and raised in South Korea and became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in 2018 (GE 1; Tr. 20, 35-36, 70-71) Both Applicant and his wife hold U.S. \npassports. (AEs G and J) Applicant\u2019s wife (formerly a school teacher) is currently a \nhomemaker who takes care of their young son. (Tr. 37) When they acquired U.S. \ncitizenship, respectively, they renounced their South Korean citizenship. (Tr. 20-21, 26) \n \nApplicant completed his formal education in South Korea and has not pursued \nany higher education credits since his immigration to the United States. (GE 1 and AE \nB) Between 2014 and 2020, he earned certificates from his employers documenting his \ndemonstrated knowledge and proficiency in routing switching, security, networks, and \nsolutions as a network engineer. (AE B) \n \nApplicant has no U.S. military service, but reported two years of required military \nservice in South Korea, between April 1994 and October 1996. (GE 1; Tr. 34) Applicant \nwas discharged from his South Korea military obligations upon completion of his \nmandatory two years of service. (GE 1)  \n \n \nSince January 2020, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor. (GE 1; Tr. 40-42) Between November 2007 and October 2017, he was \nemployed by other defense and non-defense employers in various capacities. (GE 1) \nHe is licensed to drive a motor vehicle in his U.S. state of residence. (AE H) Applicant \nhas never held either a U.S. issued security clearance or a public trust position. (Tr. 22, \n68)   \n \nBoth Applicant and his wife are registered to vote in U.S. elections. (AE L) Since \nimmigrating to the United States, neither Applicant nor his wife have voted in any \nforeign elections. (Tr. 26) \n \nFamily connections with South Korea \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother recently passed away. (Tr. 23) His father is a citizen and \nresident of South Korea. (GE 1) Applicant has a brother and four sisters who are \ncitizens and residents of South Korea. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24) While his father-in-law passed \naway some time ago, his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of South Korea. (GE 1; \nTr. 24-25)  \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant maintains annual contact by telephone with his father and last saw his \nfather in 2013 during Applicant\u2019s last trip to South Korea. (Tr. 24) Applicant maintains \nannual contact with his brother and less frequent contact with his older sisters. (Tr. 24, \n66) As with his father, he last saw his brother and sisters in 2013 on his last trip to \nSouth Korea. (Tr. 24, 56-57, 66). None of his family members have ever visited him in \nthe United States. (Tr. 51-52, 57-58) Applicant maintains even less frequent contact \nwith his mother-in-law and last talked with her by telephone over two years ago. (Tr. 58-\n59)  \n \nWhile Applicant listed several friends and acquaintances in his electronic \nquestionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) who are South Korean citizens and \nresidents, he has not spoken to any of these listed persons in several years and does \nnot consider them to be close to him in any way. (Tr.  59-60) He has not seen any of \nthese former acquaintances since he immigrated to the United States in 2007. (Tr. 60-\n61) \n \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members in South Korea have any known knowledge \nof what kind of work he does. (Tr. 23-24, 64-65, 68) And, none of his family members \nand acquaintances residing in South Korea have any reported associations or ties to the \nSouth Korea government or military. (GE 1; Tr. 64-65)  \n \nFinancial assets \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have no property or financial interests (inclusive of bank \naccounts) of their own in South Korea. (Tr. 26) By contrast, they own some real estate \nin the United States (AE C) and maintain residential leases in their U.S. state of \nresidence. (GEs C and D; Tr. 28) They also maintain their checking accounts with U.S. \nbanking institutions in their U.S. state of residence. (AEs E-F) These documented \naccounts reveal that they have $24,000 in one account and $33,000 in the other \naccount. (AEs E-F) This year Applicant opened a 401(k) retirement account in a U.S. \nfinancial institution and currently has close to $5,000 in the account. (Tr. 68)   \n \nApplicant neither provides nor receives any financial support from his father, \nsiblings, or mother-in-law residing in South Korea and does not have any personal \nfinancial dealings with them. Asked whether he intends to return to South Korea in the \nforeseeable future, Applicant confirmed he has no current intention to return to his birth \ncountry. (Tr. 32, 64)  \n \nCountry status of South Korea \n \n \nSouth Korea (officially the Republic of Korea) is a self-governing state with a \npopulation of over 46 million people. See Background Note: Korea, supra. Its religions \nare comprised of Christianity (today one of South Korea\u2019s largest religions), Buddism, \nShamanism, Confucianism, and Chandogyo. (id.) Since its liberation in August 1945, \nSouth Korea is described as a republic with powers shared between the president and \nthe legislature, which consists of a unicameral national assembly (id., at 2) Its judiciary \nconsists of a Supreme Court, appellate courts, and a Constitutional court.  \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \nThe origins of Korea\u2019s people are somewhat obscure. See Background Note: \nKorea, supra. Korea was first populated by peoples who migrated to the peninsula from \nthe northwestern regions of Asia.  An independent kingdom for much of its long history, \nKorea was occupied by Japan beginning in 1905 following the Russo-Japanese War.  \nSee Background Note: Korea, supra and The World Factbook: South Korea, the U.S. \nIntelligence Agency (May 2020).  \n \n \nFollowing the end of Japanese colonial administration in 1945, migration trends \nfrom the South to the North reversed and more Koreans returned to the South from \nJapan and Manchuria. (id.) This reverse migration continued after the Republic of Korea \nwas established in 1948 and during the Korean War (1950-1953). See Background \nNote, Korea, supra, at 8-10, and The World Factbook: South Korea, supra. A 1953 \narmistice split the Peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Under \nPark Chung-hee\u2019s leadership of South Korea (1961-1979), South Korea achieved rapid \neconomic growth, with per capita income in the country rising to roughly 17 times the \nlevel of North Korea in 1979. See id. \n \n \nIn August 1991, South Korea joined the United Nations (UN), along with North \nKorea, and has been an active participant in most UN specialized agencies and \nnumerous international fora. See Background Note: Korea, supra, at 10. South Korea \nmaintains diplomatic relations with more than 170 countries and has a broad network of \ntrading relationships throughout the world. Since normalizing relations with Japan in \n1965, the two countries have built a strong bilateral relationship centering on principles \nof mutually beneficial economic activities. Divergent positions on the process of \nrelinquishing North Korea\u2019s weapons system and South Korea\u2019s more turbulent politics \ncontinue to undermine interstate relations between South and North Korea.   \n \n \nU.S.\u2013South Korean Relations \n \n \nThe United States and Korea\u2019s Joseon Dynasty established diplomatic relations \nunder the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, and the first U.S. \ndiplomatic envoy arrived in Korea in 1883. See U.S. Relations with the Republic of \nSouth Korea, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, supra. Since their first establishing \ndiplomatic relations, the United States and South Korea have maintained a long and \nenduring history of friendship and cooperation based on shared values and interests. \n(id., at 2-3) Working together, the two countries are committed to combating regional \nand global threats and strengthening their economies. (id.) For its part, the United \nStates has maintained Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine personnel in South Korea in \nfulfillment of its commitments under the U.S.-Korea Mutual Defense Treaty to help \nSouth Korea defend itself against external aggression.  \n \n \nToday, the United States provides no development assistance to South Korea. \nSee U.S. Relations with the Republic of South Korea, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, \nsupra. While a recipient of U.S. assistance in the years after the Korean War, South \nKorea is now a development aid donor. Over the past several decades, South Korea \nhas achieved a notably high level of economic growth and is currently the United States\u2019 \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nsixth largest trading partner with a trillion dollar economy. (id., at 4-5) Bilateral relations \nbetween the United States and South Korea are marked by large-scale flows of \nmanufactured goods, agricultural products, services, and technology.  \n \nSouth Korea\u2019s direct foreign investment in the United States has nearly doubled \nsince 2011 from $19.7 billion to $38.8 billion in 2016. (id.) This makes South Korea the \nsecond largest Asian source of foreign direct investment into the United States. The \nKorean-United States trade agreement entered into force in March 2012 only \nunderscores the depth of South Korea\u2019s trade ties with the United States. (id.) Notably, \nthe United States and South Korea reached an agreement in August 2018 on \nrenegotiation of their 2012 trade agreement. \n \n \nReinforcing their strong bilateral relations with each other, the United States and \nSouth Korea belong to a number of the same international organizations. See U.S. \nRelations with the Republic of South Korea, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, supra. \nCommon memberships include the UN, G-20, Organization of Economic Cooperation \nand development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and \nthe World trade Organization (WTO) \n \n \nSouth Korean government espionage activities \n \n \nDespite South Korea\u2019s long history of democratic governance and strong bilateral \nrelations with the United States, South Korea has been involved in government \nespionage and collection activities against the United States that have resulted in U.S. \ncriminal proceedings See Administrative Notice, South Korea, supra, at 2-5.  \n \nThe U.S. Department of Justice has highlighted numerous instances of South \nKorean persons and corporations securing proprietary and/or export-controlled \ninformation in contravention of U.S. law. Examples include South Korean citizens \ncharged with illegal exportation of military-grade accelerometers to Iran; illegal \nexportation of carbon fiber and other materials to Iran and China via South Korea; illegal \nexportation of infrared military technology to South Korea; illegal exportation of technical \ndata to South Korea; and illegal exportation of rocket propulsion systems, engines, and \ntechnology to South Korea. See Request for Administrative Notice, South Korea, supra; \nSummary of Major U.S. Export Enforcement, Economic Espionage, Trade Secret and \nEmbargo-Related Criminal Cases (January 2015 to the Present), U.S. Department of \nJustice (January 2018) \n \n \nGlobally, South Korea remains one of seven countries most actively engaged in \nforeign collection and industrial espionage against the United States. The United States \nrestricts the export of sensitive, dual-use technologies that can have civilian uses, but \nalso can be used for military purposes or to build weapons of mass destruction. Reports \ndocument that South Korea has been the unauthorized recipient of technology \ncontrolled under the U.S. control laws, including material that could be used in missile \ndelivery/reentry systems, encryption, software, military truck parts, and night vision \ncameras. See Request Administrative Notice, South Korea, supra.; Summary of Major \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \nU.S. Export Enforcement, Economic Espionage, Trade Secret and Embargo-Related \nCriminal Cases, supra. \n \n \nSouth Korea\u2019s human rights record \n \n \nHuman rights are generally respected by the South Korean government. See \nRepublic of Korea 2019 Human Rights Report, U.S. Department of State (March 2020). \nAlthough, there have been reports of human rights problems. Identified problems \ninclude societal discrimination against women, persons with disabilities and minorities, \ndomestic violence and rape, and corruption. (id.) Overall, though, South Korea\u2019s human \nrights record is compatible with generally accepted international norms of state respect \nfor human rights. \n \n \nCharacter references and awards \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors, colleagues (past and present), \nand friends who know him. Uniformly, they credit him with honesty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. (AE A; Tr. 27) Applicant has received numerous awards from his \ncurrent employer recognizing his contributions as a network engineer. (AE K) \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe Concern:  Foreign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nBurdens of Proof \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1.  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nApplicant and his wife immigrated to the United States in 2007 and became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in 2018. He has a father, brother and four sisters, and a \nmother-in-law who are citizens and residents of South Korea. He has no property or \nfinancial interests in South Korea.  \n \n \nKey to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns are Applicant\u2019s immediate \nand extended family members who are citizens and residents South Korea. Despite \nSouth Korea\u2019s long history of democratic governance and strong bilateral relations the \ncountry enjoys with the United States, South Korea has been involved in government \nespionage and collection activities against the United States that have resulted in U.S. \ncriminal proceedings.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s contacts with his father, siblings and mother-in-law are \ninfrequent, they are longstanding. And, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person \nwith immediate family members in a foreign country has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption covers in-laws \n(to include Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law who resides in South Korea).

With \nrespect to South Korea, the country is free from risks of potential hostage taking. South \nKorea\u2019s strong bilateral relations with the United States and long history of recognition \nof democratic principles of governance together help to minimize any risk of pressure or \ncompromise to any of Applicant\u2019s family members residing in South Korea.  \n \n \nStill because of South Korea\u2019s history of collection activities against the \nproprietary interests of U.S. corporations and individuals, the Government urges \nsecurity concerns over risks that Applicant and his family members in South Korea \nmight be subject to exploitation, coercion or duress by civilian or military authorities in \nthe country to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. \nApplicant\u2019s family ties warrant some application of two of the disqualifying conditions of \nthe foreign influence guideline DC \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign \nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d and 7(b), \n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential \nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or \ncountry by providing that information or technology.\u201d \n \n \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s family members in South Korea have any history to \ndate of being subjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical antecedents limit \nthe risk of any potential conflict situation. And, while the absence of any past coercive  \nor compromising measures taken by South Korean authorities does not absolve \nApplicant from any coercive or compromising risks in the future given South Korea\u2019s \ncheckered history of collection activities in the United States, the risks of such actions  \nbeing taken against his himself or family members in South Korea is minimal \nconsidering South Korea\u2019s bilateral ties with the United States. And, when it comes to \nrisk assessment, South Korea\u2019s government relations with the United States are among \nthe most important considerations to be considered when assessing risks associated \nwith an applicant\u2019s family ties and property interests in that country.

Given the substantial \nfinancial and family ties that Applicant and his wife currently maintain in the United \nStates, any potential conflicts that Applicant could potentially face any of his family \nmembers in South Korea promise to be minor and reconcilable with Applicant\u2019s sizable \nfamily, personal financial stakes in the United States, and demonstrated appreciation of \nand devotion to U.S. security interests.   \n \n \nBecause neither Applicant\u2019s relationships with his family members in South \nKorea are significant, the risks of his having to make personal choices incompatible with \nU.S. security interests are minimal. Based on the evidence compiled in this record, safe \npredictions can be made about the future safety of Applicant\u2019s family members in South \nKorea and his ability to protect himself and his spouse against any physical or economic \npressures brought to bear on him by South Korean government or military officials. \n \n \nOther mitigating conditions available to Applicant are \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d and 8(f), \u201cthe \nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such \nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d  In Applicant\u2019s case, he has demonstrated little \nrecent contact with his family members residing in South Korea. And, he has no \nreported property or financial interests in South Korea. By contrast, he and his wife have \nconsiderable property and financial interests in the United States. \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in South Korea are less \nsignificant than his connections to his family members and financial interests in the \nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s substantial connections to the United States when considered \ntogether with his diminished foreign connections with South Korea are sufficient to \novercome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.   \n \nWhole-person assessment \n \n \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain \nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance takes account of the U.S. citizenship of Applicant, his wife and son who are \ncitizens and residents of the United States.  Based on the evidence presented, there is \nno evidence that his relatives or former acquaintances residing in South Korea are \ngovernment employees or military personnel. While less is known about Applicant\u2019s \nformer friends and acquaintances in South Korea, none of his family members residing \nin South Korea have any known ties or connections to South Korea\u2019s government or \nmilitary.  \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning South Korea must also take into consideration \nthe geopolitical situation and dangers of the country. Because of its significant collection \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nactivities in the United States, South Korea must be considered a country that poses \nsome heightened risks despite its long history democratic governance and strong bilateral \nrelationships with the United States. Still, based on the developed record, South Korea \nremains a trusted ally in the war on terrorism.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 30, 2017. \nOn September 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative \ndecisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 18, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \n\n \n2 \n \nnotice of hearing on December 11, 2019, and the hearing was convened on January 15, \n2020. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. The record \nwas held open to permit submission of additional documentary evidence, and Applicant \nsubmitted AE C. All of the Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 24, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old quality assurance supervisor for a defense contractor, \nemployed since September 2017. He honorably served on active duty in the United States \nAir Force from 1995 to 2015, when he retired. He was a full-time student from 2015 to \n2017. He received two associate\u2019s degrees in 2012, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He \nmarried and divorced three times; from 1995 to 1999; 2006 to 2010; and 2014 to 2018. \nHe has three children, ages 24, 19, and 10, none of whom live with him. He held a security \nclearance while on active duty. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant owes approximately $46,000 in delinquent debts, \nincluding a truck loan, child support arrearages, credit card, medical, store credit, and \nutility debts. He admitted the child support, credit card, and store credit allegations, and \ndenied the car loan, medical, and phone service debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.f). The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits support the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant refinanced his home in January 2020, and paid debts, including \ndelinquent debts noted on his current credit report. He distributed $152,059 toward debts, \nincluding SOR debts for child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), and a credit card \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). He used funds to pay other debts, including a portion of his mortgage, \npersonal loan, student loan, and a credit card debt, none of which were alleged in the \nSOR. He received an additional $81,000 in cash. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent car loan. Applicant co-signed a truck loan in 2011 \nwith his girlfriend at the time, and shortly thereafter they parted ways. His girlfriend had \nthe truck and was responsible to make the payments, but she defaulted after paying about \n$21,000. The truck was repossessed and sold by the lender. The lender sent notifications \nto his girlfriend to collect a deficiency balance, but not him. Applicant learned of the \ndefaulted loan during his security clearance interview, and tried to obtain information from \nthe lender, but was unsuccessful. A collection company eventually attempted to recover \nthe balance owed. Applicant disputed the debt amount because it should have been \nreduced by the value of the truck when sold. The account was eventually removed from \nhis current credit report and no collection action continued. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a medical debt that was resolved in 2018. The medical company used \nthe wrong information when they submitted the charges to Applicant\u2019s military retirement \nmedical insurance. The account is now resolved. SOR \u00b6 1.f is a telephone service debt. \nApplicant disputed the bill in 2013 or 2014 as incorrect after canceling the service. He \nagain disputed the amount owed in 2017, and with a collection company in 2020. The \n\n \n3 \n \ndebt has been removed from his current credit report. SOR \u00b6 1.g is a store credit account \nfor furniture purchased in 2010 for a former girlfriend. She and Applicant parted ways, \nand she took the furniture. She eventually defaulted on the loan. Applicant contacted the \nlender in 2017 or 2018, but did not receive the requested information on the debt. The \ndebt has been removed from his credit report, and there are no current collection efforts. \n \nApplicant attributes his debts to overspending while on active duty where he \nearned less income than he does now. He ignored some of his debts and was unaware \nof others. Regardless, he did not have funds to pay them while he was a student. Once \nhe was hired in his current position and applied for a security clearance, he began to \naddress his debts, and with the help of his refinanced home, was able to pay \ndelinquencies on his credit report. He has not received financial counseling. He testified \nthat he has bank accounts valued at about $4,000 (before receiving his refinancing cash \ndistribution). He earns an annual salary of about $88,000, and receives annual military \nretirement pay and VA disability pay of about $35,000. He testified that he meets his \nexpenses and debts with his current income, and applies any excess to increase his \nmortgage payments in an effort to pay off his home mortgage early. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\n \n4 \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has had financial delinquencies resulting from an overspending for his \nincome while on active duty, making unsound financial decisions, and insufficient income \nafter retiring and while attending school. Since finding new employment at greater pay, \nApplicant has shown sufficient efforts to resolve the delinquent debts that continued to \nappear on his credit report. He disputed debts for which he believed he was not \nresponsible, and they have been removed from his current credit report. His most recent \ncredit report reflects no delinquent accounts that have not been resolved in January with \nhis mortgage refinance disbursements. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial status no longer \nraises concerns about his debts, financial management decisions, and ability to address \nfuture obligations. His financial status no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Mitigating conditions under \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d) and (e) \napply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s military service and employment history. I remain convinced of his newly \nacquired financial responsibility and his ability to meet future financial obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s \napplication for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He served in the U.S. Air National Guard from 2009 to 2014 and was honorably discharged. (Items 3-4) The SOR alleged Applicant accumulated seven collection and five charged-off debts totaling approximately $24,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l). The allegations are supported by his statements to a defense investigator during his background investigation in June 2018, credit reports from August 2017 and January 2019, and admissions in his SOR answer. (Items 2, 4-6) Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his life becoming difficult without further explanation. After receiving the SOR, Applicant engaged a debt relief company (DRC) to settle eight of his SOR debts. Four SOR debts totaling $1,336 were not addressed by the DRC and Applicant provided no further information on their status. Under his DRC plan, Applicant began making $147.50 bi-weekly payments to the DRC in November 2019.

DOD acted under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 25, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 14, 2019. The evidence \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-6 (Items 1-2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on \nDecember 18, 2019.

He has worked for \nthis employer for approximately two years. He is a high school graduate and has \ncompleted some college courses. He is single and has no children. He served in the \nU.S. Air National Guard from 2009 to 2014 and was honorably discharged. (Items 3-4) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant accumulated seven collection and five charged-off \ndebts totaling approximately $24,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l). The allegations are supported by \nhis statements to a defense investigator during his background investigation in June \n2018, credit reports from August 2017 and January 2019, and admissions in his SOR \nanswer. (Items 2, 4-6)  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his life becoming difficult without \nfurther explanation. After receiving the SOR, Applicant engaged a debt relief company \n(DRC) to settle eight of his SOR debts. Four SOR debts totaling $1,336 were not \naddressed by the DRC and Applicant provided no further information on their status. \nUnder his DRC plan, Applicant began making $147.50 bi-weekly payments to the DRC \nin November 2019. Applicant provided documentation from the DRC showing that as of \nJanuary 20, 2020, he had a balance of $555 in his DRC account and two debts had \nbeen settled, although the specific settled debts are not identified in the documentation. \n(Item 2; AE A-C) \n \n \nApplicant prepared an income and expense statement for the DRC, which \nshowed that he has a monthly income of approximately $3,600, with monthly expenses \nof approximately $3,270, leaving a net monthly remainder of $330. He did not provide \nany evidence that he sought financial counseling, other than engaging the DRC. (Item \n2; AE A-C) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n\n \n3 \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,000 that \nremain unpaid. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant was made aware of his delinquent debts \nduring his background investigation in June 2018, but he failed to address his debts \nuntil after he received the SOR in October 2019. He engaged the assistance of a DRC \nin November 2019 and has made a few payments under that plan. However, his DRC \nplan fails to account for four SOR debts and Applicant provided no additional \ninformation about the status of those debts. He also failed to provide specific \ninformation about whether his inability to make timely payments toward his debts was \ndue to circumstances beyond his control. At this point, it is too early to determine \nwhether Applicant will make the required effort to continue his DRC payments and \naddress the four debts not included in the plan. None of the above listed mitigating \nconditions fully apply.  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and his recent efforts to engage a DRC \nto address his debts. However, Applicant\u2019s actions to resolve his delinquent debts can \nbe characterized as, too little too late. He has not established a meaningful track record \nof financial responsibility, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 25, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 30, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on February 6, \n2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, \nprovide documentary evidence, or object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and it is \nadmitted. The case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He is not married and has no children. He attended \ncollege, but did not earn a degree. He later earned a technical certificate. Applicant has \nworked with his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2017. (Item 3)  \n \n \nIn November 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of \nmarijuana, first offense in State A. This charge was dismissed following completion of a \ndrug education class, mandatory drug testing, and a probationary period. (Items 2, 3, 4, \n5, 6) \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in September 2018 and charged with possession of \nmarijuana, a first offense misdemeanor in State B. Applicant disputed the September \n2018 date and said it occurred in October 2018. Court documents confirm the September \n2018 date. His charge was deferred, pending the completion of a drug-screen \nassessment to determine if he needed drug counseling and the completion of three drug \ntests a month apart. He was also required to complete 100 hours of community service. \nHe began drug testing in January 2019, completed the terms of the deferment in June \n2019, and the charge was dismissed. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on December 20, \n2018. In it, he disclosed that he used marijuana once every few days from August 2010 \nuntil October 2018, the month he said he was arrested for marijuana possession. He also \ndisclosed that he intended to continue using marijuana as a sleep aid and because it was \nlegal in the jurisdiction where he lived. (Item 3) \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. During \nhis interview, he told the investigator that he intends to continue to use marijuana when \nhe goes out, but had not used it since January 2019, because, at that time, he had to \npass the three drug tests that were part of the diversion program for his 2018 marijuana \npossession arrest. He stated he would probably use marijuana after his probationary \nperiod ends in June 2019, but could stop if he needed to. He stated that his family and \nfriends use marijuana. He said that his marijuana use has decreased over the years, and \nhe probably only used it three or four times during the past year. Applicant stated that he \nusually obtains marijuana from individuals in social settings, typically from a friend or \ncousin. (Item 6) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant answered government interrogatories on September 12, 2019. He \ndisclosed that his last marijuana use was December 12, 2018. He was \u201cgifted\u201d the \nmarijuana from his cousin. He indicated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. \n(Item 6). \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and m2itigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n\n \n4 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n \nFrom August 2010 to December 2018, Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency. He was arrested twice for possession of marijuana. He disclosed in his \nDecember 2018 SCA that he intended to continue using marijuana as a sleep aid and \nbecause it was legal in the jurisdiction where he lived. He told a government investigator \nin March 2019 that he had stopped using marijuana so he could comply with court ordered \ndrug tests that concluded in June 2019. He further stated that he would probably use \nmarijuana after his probation ended, but could stop if needed. In his September 2019 \nresponse to government interrogatories, he stated he did not intend to use marijuana in \nthe future. The evidence supports that Applicant has not clearly and convincingly \ncommitted to discontinue marijuana use. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n  \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he used marijuana from 2010 to 2018 every \nfew days. He stated that he decreased his use in 2018. He asserted in his December \n2018 SCA that he intended to continue to use marijuana. He used marijuana after his \n2011 arrest for possession of marijuana and after his October 2018 arrest for possession \nof marijuana and until he started his mandated drug screening in January 2019. He stated \nhe probably would continue to use marijuana after he completed the drug tests required \nfor his criminal charge deferment, but could stop if needed. Applicant has a long history \nof marijuana use. Applicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use was less than two years ago. He \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence that future use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) does \nnot apply. \n \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of marijuana use. He stated in his September 2019 \nresponse to government interrogatories that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. This was the first time he indicated his intent to cease illegal drug use. His past \nstatements were conditioned upon his being required to stop using them. It is unknown \nwhen Applicant last used marijuana. Applicant stated that his family and friends use \nmarijuana and that he continues to associate with them. He disclosed, during his \nbackground interview, that he is given marijuana by individuals in social settings. He also \nstated he was \u201cgifted\u201d marijuana. There is insufficient evidence to establish a pattern of \nabstinence, disassociation from drug-using friends and family; or changing or avoiding \nthe environment where drugs were used. AG \u00b6 26(b) has minimal application because \nApplicant\u2019s statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, was made recently \nand after repeated statements that he intended to use marijuana in the future.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n6 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence \nentity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, \nor community standing; and  \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity.  \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs from August 2010 to 2018. He was arrested in 2011 \nand 2018 for possession of marijuana. He continues to associate with family and friends \nwho use illegal drugs. The evidence supports the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or unwilling to comply with \nrules and regulations.  \n \nApplicant stated that his drug use was legal in the jurisdiction where he lived. \nHowever, he was arrested twice for marijuana possession in other jurisdictions, where it \nwas illegal. He continued to use marijuana after his arrests. He continues to associate \nwith family and friends who use marijuana. Applicant\u2019s behavior has not been infrequent \nand insufficient time has not passed to conclude his conduct is unlikely to recur. His \nconduct raises questions about his good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The \nabove mitigating conditions do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2017, for \nwhich the use of marijuana is prohibited. His past marijuana use from 2010 through 2018; \nhis two arrests for marijuana possession; and his continued association with family and \nfriends, who use marijuana, continue to raise security concerns. Based on that history, \nhis most recent statement that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future is not \ncredible. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 27, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD \non June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 2, 2020, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On February 4, 2020, the case was assigned to me, and \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for February 25, 2020. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n\n2 \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6 into evidence, which I admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and \nsubmitted four documents, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, also \nadmitted into evidence without objection. At the request of Applicant, I held the record \nopen until March 17, 2020  for him to submit additional documentation. On March 11, \n2020, Applicant requested an extension of time to submit documentation, without an \nobjection from Department Counsel. I granted Applicant an additional two weeks, until \nMarch 31, 2020. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 5, 2020. On March \n31, 2020, Applicant provided eight documents, which I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) \nE through L, and I admitted all of the documents into evidence without objection. The \nrecord closed on March 31, 2020.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges financial considerations security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s \nunfiled Federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2017. The SOR also alleges \nfour unpaid credit card accounts totaling approximately $22,500. In his Answer, Applicant \nadmitted all of the SOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e.) After careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He graduated from high school in 1982. He served on \nactive duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1985 to 1989. He was a sergeant at the time of his \nhonorable discharge. After his separation, he was transferred to the inactive reserve. \nApplicant attended college seeking a physical therapy degree, but in 1999, he dropped \nout of the last class he needed to complete a college degree. Since February 2018, he \nhas been employed as an engineer with a DOD contractor. His annual salary is \napproximately $80,000. He has been married since 1999, and he has two daughters, \nages 17 and 14, and an eight-year-old son. His wife works full-time as a comptroller and \nmakes approximately $90,000 a year. (Tr. 24-29, 31-32; GE 1, GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse have been employed full-time since 2015, making \napproximately $150,000 to $170,000 per year. He stated that their financial and tax \nproblems developed after their restaurant business failed. They opened their first \nrestaurant in 2004, and later sold it in 2012. He stated this restaurant was making a little \nbit of money over the years. Applicant worked other full-time employments from February \n2008 through July 2011, February 2012 to July 2012, and October 2012 to April 2013, \nwhich overlapped with his restaurant business. Applicant opened another restaurant in \n2013 at an outdoor mall. Due to cold temperatures during the winter season, and other \nunfavorable weather conditions, the restaurant did not have many customers. The \nrestaurant was occasionally busy on the weekends, but during the weekdays, the \nrestaurant had a very limited number of customers. Applicant and his wife soon used \ncredit cards to fund their business operation. Applicant used what little money he had to \npay his employees, to the detriment of his creditors. After two years of losing money, \nApplicant and his wife decided to close the restaurant in 2015. (Tr. 32-36) \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns, as required, for tax years \n2010 through 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He stated that the unfiled Federal income tax returns \nfrom 2010 through 2017 resulted from his wife, who was the one who usually prepared \ntheir tax returns, being too busy with the restaurant business and children. He admitted \nat the hearing that the estimated amount of Federal taxes currently owed is more than \n$10,000. Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant also did not timely file his state \nincome tax returns for the same years. He estimated that he owed approximately $3,000 \nfor delinquent state taxes.  \n \n \nApplicant claimed that he was not aware that their income tax returns had not been \nfiled for several years. Applicant and his spouse filed all of their delinquent Federal income \ntax returns in September 2019. He stated it took approximately four weeks to gather the \nnecessary paperwork to get their tax returns filed. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant \nhad not reached an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the repayment \nof his delinquent Federal taxes, nor had he reached a repayment agreement with the \nstate\u2019s department of taxation. Post-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant \nshowed that on March 26, 2020, he and his spouse sent FORM 12153, a Request for a \nCollection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing, concerning their delinquent Federal taxes \nowed for tax year 2013. (AE E) Although Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax returns have \nrecently been filed, his delinquent Federal tax debt has not been resolved. (Tr. 36-41, 45; \nGE 3)  \n \n \n Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $9,066 for a charged-off credit \ncard balance. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant stated that he contacted the creditor in December \n2019, and the creditor told him he had two options with the charged-off account:  He could \ndo nothing since the account is no longer in collection, or he could pay the debt. Applicant \nhas not paid any money on this account. His background interview took place in \nNovember 2018, and during the interview the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR were \ndiscussed with Applicant. During the hearing, Department Counsel asked why it took \nApplicant over a year after his interview to make contact with the creditor. Applicant stated \nthat he did not have an answer. He stated that this creditor informed him a 1099-C will be \nissued to him in April 2020. (Tr. 45-48) \n \n \nPost-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant showed that on March 3, \n2020, he and his spouse received a confirmation of settlement offer from the creditor. The \nletter stated that the current balance was $9,067, but if a payment of $4,081 was received \nno later than March 3, 2021, the account would be considered settled. There was no \nevidence submitted to show that the settlement payment of $4,081 was made, therefore, \nthis account is unresolved. (AE F) \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $7,955 \nfor a charged-off credit card balance. Applicant reported that in approximately February \n2020 a default judgment was issued against him, which at the time of the hearing, was \nstill unsatisfied. Applicant stated that he contacted the creditor in December 2019 in an \nattempt to resolve the debt. He admitted that over a year has passed since his \n\n4 \n \nbackground interview in November 2018, where he did not call, email, or contact the \ncreditor in any fashion to resolve this debt. (Tr. 49-50) \n \n \nPost-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant showed that on March 3, \n2020, Applicant\u2019s bank reported to the court that his account had $3,064 available for \ngarnishment. On March 12, 2020, the creditor sent a letter of acceptance for a payment \nplan with the following conditions: Balance due $8,170, and $425 paid by April 17, 2020, \nand $425 paid monthly thereafter until the debt is paid in full. There was no evidence \nsubmitted showing that the any payments have been made on this delinquent debt. This \naccount is unresolved. (AE G) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $2,440 \nfor a charged-off credit card balance. Post-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant \nshowed that on February 28, 2020, the creditor offered a settlement. The settlement offer \nletter stated that the current balance was $2,440, and if Applicant made a payment of \n$1,099 no later than February 28, 2021, the account would be considered settled. There \nwas no evidence submitted showing that the settlement payment of $1,099 was made to \nthe creditor, therefore, this account is unresolved. (Tr. 51 AE H) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $3,027 \nfor an unpaid credit card balance referred for collection. At the hearing, Applicant provided \na document showing that the account had been settled in February 2020 after he made \na payment of $1,200. This account has been resolved. (Tr. 16-20, 51; GE 4; AE C) \n \n \nApplicant admitted there were a couple of more creditors that have developed \nrecently with outstanding balances that were not reported in the SOR. He was unable to \nstate with certainty the total amount of these debts since his wife handles the household \nfinances. Applicant and his wife both purchased new cars in 2015, the same year they \nclosed their restaurant after two years of poor business. Applicant estimated that the cars \nwill be paid off in approximately 18 months. (Tr. 52-54) \n \n \nPost-hearing documentation submitted by Applicant showed that as of March 28, \n2020, he and his spouse did not have sufficient income to pay their monthly expenses \nand the monthly settlement payment for the debt alleged in SOR 1.c. His wife was \nfurloughed by her employer in mid-March 2020, due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Her \nmonthly unemployment income was $2,078, and after paying all of the expenses listed \non their budget, there was a deficiency balance of -$1,620 at the end of the month. (AE \nI) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n5 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n6 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2010 \nthrough 2017, and owes a substantial debt to the IRS for pass-due taxes. He is also \ndelinquent in four credit card accounts totaling over $20,000 that have been delinquent \nfor several years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable but not dispositive. To his credit, Applicant has recently \nfiled the 2010-2017 Federal income tax returns, but his tax debt remains unresolved. His \neventual compliance with his tax obligations does not end the inquiry. A security \nclearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an \n\n7 \n \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. A person who fails repeatedly to \nfulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. \n15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). The \nfact that Applicant has filed his past-due tax returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \nApplicants who begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their \npersonal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s has four credit card delinquent accounts totaling $22,488. He did not \ncontact these creditors for over a year despite that he had been placed on notice during \nhis 2018 background interview that these debts were a concern to the Government. He \nonly contacted these creditors approximately two months before his hearing. He settled \none debt for less than the full value the same month he had his hearing. Applicant has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances, and there is no systematic track record \nof payments to his creditors. There is little evidence of any debt-resolution efforts until his \npost-hearing submission of documents, and there is no evidence of any credit counseling.\n \n \n \nApplicant submitted several settlement offers with a promise to pay the amounts \nagreed upon at some point in the future. A promise to attend to his debts as soon as he \nis able, however sincere, is not a substitute for a track record of repayment. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 99-0447, App. Bd. July 25, 2000 at p. 3 (promise to take remedial steps \nin future concerning delinquent debts is not evidence of reform or rehabilitation). \nApplicant's promises to pay his remaining debts are not a substitute for a consistent \nrecord of timely remedial action. \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt \nreduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter \nof law, to establish that he or she has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All \nthat is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he or she has \u201c. . . established a plan \nto resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that \nplan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. (See Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2(a)) \n \n \nApplicant noted in his post-hearing documents that his wife was recently \nfurloughed and their income was reduced due to the Coronavirus pandemic spreading \nthroughout the United States. Due to this situation, he is unable to pay on the settlement \noffers he obtained from his creditors. This, of course, is unfortunate and certainly a \nsituation beyond his control. However, after reviewing his full financial history, Applicant \nand his spouse ignored their obligation to file income tax returns for eight consecutive \nyears. They jointly earned $150,000 to $170,000 annually, but Applicant did not take any \naction to set up a payment plan with the Internal Revenue Service, or with their other \n\n8 \n \ncreditors, which took place well before the pandemic. Applicant did not mitigate the \nfinancial considerations security concerns arising from eight consecutive years of filing \nlate income tax returns, unresolved delinquent taxes, and credit card debt. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant filed the 2010-2017 delinquent income tax returns in September 2019. \nHe does not have any established payment plan to resolve his Federal tax debt or the \nthree remaining credit card debts totaling approximately $20,000. Given his burden to \ndemonstrate reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the SOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/09/2020\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. \nEligibility for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 3, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On October 26, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nOn November 12, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 3)  A complete copy of \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on January 8, 2020, and he was \nafforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a \ncopy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on January 22, 2020. His response was due on February \n21, 2020. Applicant timely submitted a one-page statement to the FORM with seven \nattachments which were accepted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 5, 2020. The record closed on March 5, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nSOR allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and accompanying \ncomments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence \nin the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a computer operator with his current employer since June 2018. He had previous \nexperience as a quality control inspector (July 2015 until July 2017), and as a drilling fluids \nspecialist (May 2012 until February 2015). He is a 1989 high school graduate. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Navy in April 1992, and served on active duty until he was honorably retired \nas a petty officer first class (E-6) in May 2012.  He was granted a secret clearance in July \n1992. He was married in 1996, and divorced in 2008. He has no children.  \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 6 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated August 4, 2018); Item 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May \n13, 2019); Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 18, 2019); Item 4 (SF 86, dated \nJune 3, 2018); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February 28, 2019); and Item \n3 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to SOR, dated November 12, 2019).  \n \nApplicant reported that he was unemployed due to layoffs on two occasions: from \nFebruary 2012 until February 2015, and from July 2017 until June 2018. (Item 4, at 13-\n14) As a result of the cumulative effect of his layoffs, he underwent periods of financial \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nstrain and got behind on his bills. Several accounts became delinquent, and although he \nattempted to resolve issues with his home mortgage, the house was eventually \nforeclosed.  \nIn his June 2018 SF 86, Applicant candidly listed having five delinquent accounts, \nincluding his foreclosure, attributing them to his unemployment and resulting insufficient \nfunds. (Item 4, at 35-40) In February 2019, during an interview with an investigator from \nthe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant characterized his financial \nsituation as \u201cimproving.\u201d He discussed four specific accounts, and he claimed that he had \nbeen in contact with collection agencies, and he has either been making payment \narrangements to pay off his debts, or he has been making monthly payments to his \ncreditors. (Item 5, at 5) In his Answer to the SOR, he confirmed that since returning to \nwork, he had made arrangements with his creditors, and that payments have been \nregularly made on all accounts. (Item 3, at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s May 2019 credit report reported one foreclosure and four charged-off \naccounts (one of which was listed under both the original creditor and the debt purchaser), \nand reflected that other accounts either were current or had zero balances. (Item 7) His \nDecember 2019 credit report reported that Applicant had made payments to several \naccounts that had resulted in decreases of the remaining balances for several delinquent \naccounts. (Item 8)  \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $35,474, not \napproximately $37,000 as alleged by Department Counsel, as set forth as follows:  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is a credit-card account with a past due and unpaid balance of $16,171 \nthat was charged off in the amount of $16,721. Applicant had been making payments, \nwith the most recent reported $50 payment listed in his December 2019 credit report \nmade in November 2019, and the unpaid balance had been reduced to $15,821. (Item 6, \nat 10; Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 2; Item 5, at 5) However, Applicant submitted two receipts \nfrom the collection agent reflecting $50 payments made in December 2019 and January \n2020, reducing the remaining balance to $15,721 as of January 24, 2020. (Letters, dated \nDecember 23, 2019, and January 24, 2020, attached to his Response to the FORM) The \naccount is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is another credit-card account with a past due and unpaid balance of \n$16,141 that was charged off in the amount of $16,716. Applicant had been making \npayments, with the most recent reported $150 payment listed in his December 2019 credit \nreport made in November 2019, and the unpaid balance had been reduced to $15,091. \n(Item 6, at 9; Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 2; Item 5, at 5) However, Applicant submitted two \nreceipts from the collection agent reflecting $150 payments made in December 2019 and \nJanuary 2020, reducing the remaining balance to $14,792 as of January 23, 2020. \n(Letters, dated November 21, 2019, and January 23, 2020, attached to his Response to \nthe FORM) The account is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a furniture store charge account with an unpaid balance of $3,162 \nthat was charged off and sold to a debt purchaser. Applicant had been making payments, \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nwith the most recent reported $51 payment listed in his December 2019 credit report \nmade in December 2019, and the unpaid balance had been reduced to $2,783. (Item 6, \nat 9; Item 7, at 2; Item 8, at 1; Item 5, at 5) However, Applicant submitted two receipts \nfrom the debt purchaser reflecting $51 payments made in January 2020 and February \n2020, reducing the remaining balance to $2,733 as of January 23, 2020. (Letters, dated \nJanuary 3, 2020, and January 22, 2020, attached to his Response to the FORM) The \naccount is in the process of being resolved. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s contention in February 2019 that his overall financial situation \nwas \u201cimproving,\u201d it is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be \nbecause he did not report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any \nmonthly remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is \nno evidence of a budget. Although he had previously indicated that once his employment \nis secured he planned to seek credit counseling, there is no documentary evidence of \nfinancial counseling. (Item 4) In the absence of additional financial information, it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $35,474. \nThose three accounts became delinquent because of Applicant\u2019s inablility to maintain \nthem in a current status due to his unemployment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been \nestablished, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts \nregardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n  \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all partially or fully apply. As noted above, \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by two events that were largely beyond his \ncontrol: he was laid off from two jobs, and the periods of unemployment left him without \nthe financial means to maintain his accounts in a current status. A review of his credit \nreports reveal that while these particular accounts remained delinquent, he successfully \naddressed most of his other accounts. Throughout the security clearance review process, \nApplicant was proactive and candid. In February 2019 \u2013 approximately nine months \nbefore the SOR was issued \u2013 he characterized his financial situation as \u201cimproving,\u201d and \nhe claimed that he had been in contact with his creditors or their representatives, and that \nhe has either been making payment arrangements to pay off his debts, or he has been \nmaking monthly payments on them. Documentary evidence supports his claims that he \nhas been making periodic payments to each of his three SOR-related creditors. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)). In this instance, there is substantial evidence, supported by \ndocumentation, that Applicant did not merely make promises to pay his debts, but took \ngood-faith corrective actions with respect to them well before the SOR was issued.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n8 \n                                      \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. Although it remains \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen, his actions under the difficult circumstances with which he was confronted, no \nlonger cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. He failed \nto exercise sufficient control over his various accounts to assure that they were \nmaintained in a current status. As a result, three accounts were placed for collection and \ncharged off. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling.  Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. \nHe has been serving as a computer operator with his current employer since June 2018. \nHe had previous experience as a quality control inspector (July 2015 until July 2017). And \nas a drilling fluids specialist (May 2012 until February 2015). He is a 1989 high school \ngraduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1992, and served on active duty until he \nwas honorably retired as a petty officer first class (E-6) in May 2012.  He was granted a \nsecret clearance in July 1992. His financial problems were not self-made difficulties. They \nwere created by two layoffs and two periods of unemployment. As soon as he was \nfinancially able, well before the SOR was issued, he started addressing his accounts. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant\u2019s current track record is fair-to-good and encouraging, commencing \nmeaningful resolution efforts well before the SOR was issued. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, \nApp. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen from China, failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nher familial relationships with individuals who are citizens and residents of China. \nClearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nThe DOD Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the foreign influence guideline on \nSeptember 20, 2019. The DOD CAF took this action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, signed by President \nEisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, \n1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, 2017. Based on the \navailable information, DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that \nthe case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke \nor deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The Government \nserved discovery on Applicant on November 20, 2019. The Government\u2019s discovery \nletter is appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. At the hearing, convened on \nFebruary 27, 2020, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through D without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals received the transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2020.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nregarding the People\u2019s Republic of China (China). Without objection from Applicant, I \napproved the request and the document is appended to the record as HE II. (Tr. 14-15) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 57, has worked for a federal contracting company as a software \nengineer since 2001. She has spent her career working on projects supporting the \nDOD; however, these projects did not require access to classified information. Applicant \ncompleted a security clearance application, her first, in May 2016, disclosing that her \nhusband, mother, and two brothers are residents and citizens of China. These \nrelationships serve as the basis for the SOR. (Tr. 17, 27-29, 37; GE 1)  \n \n \n \nApplicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen from China. China is an authoritarian state \nin which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount authority. CCP \nmembers hold almost all top government and security apparatus positions. Chinese \nleaders are focused on developing the capabilities they deem necessary to deter or \ndefeat adversary power projection and counter third parties including the United States \nin conflicts. China's military modernization is producing capabilities that have the \npotential to reduce core U.S. military technological advantages. The National \nCounterintelligence Executive has identified China and Russia as the most aggressive \ncollectors of U.S. economic information and technology. China's intelligence services, \nas well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese \ncitizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to steal \nsecrets. Agents of the Chinese government are the world's most active and persistent \nperpetrators of economic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information continue and represent a persistent threat to U.S. economic \nsecurity. (HE II.) \n \nIn assessing the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic \nrelationship between the U.S. and China, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission has reported that the Chinese government has conducted \nlarge-scale cyber espionage against the United States. China has compromised a range \nof U.S. networks, including those of DOD, defense contractors, and private enterprises. \nChina's substantial and sustained investment in defense research and development \n(R&D) has helped China improve its military-industrial complex. China's state sponsored \n\n \n3 \n \ntheft of intellectual property and proprietary information has allowed China to fill \nknowledge gaps in its domestic defense and commercial R&D. (HE II.) \n \nThe Chinese government engages in the repression and coercion against \norganizations and individuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, and public \ninterest and ethnic minority issues. Human rights concerns in China include: repression \nof speech, religion, association, assembly, the press, and movement for certain \nminorities; extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention; \ntorture and coerced confessions of prisoners; a lack of due process in judicial \nproceedings; searches of premises without warrants; monitoring of communications \n(including telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, \nand Internet communications); and opening of domestic and international mail. \nAdditionally, citizens lack the right to change their government and had limited forms of \nredress against the government. (HE II.) \n \nBefore immigrating to the United States in 1996, Applicant trained and worked as \na physician for 11 years. She immigrated to the United States to pursue a master\u2019s \ndegree in computer science, and has worked in that field since completing her degree in \n2001. Applicant met her husband in medical school and married in 1987. He also \nworked as a physician until 1997, when he transitioned into a position developing herbal \nmedicine products for a Chinese company. Applicant sponsored her husband\u2019s \nimmigration to the United States and he received permanent resident status in 2007. \nApplicant has reported her relationship and contact with her husband to her employer, \nas required. Applicant\u2019s husband continues to live and work in China, traveling to the \nUnited States three to four times each year to spend time with Applicant and the \ncouple\u2019s U.S.-born son, who is now 14 years old. Each month Applicant\u2019s husband \ntransfers money into Applicant\u2019s U.S. bank account to help her with living and education \nexpenses for their son. Applicant\u2019s husband plans to resign his position in the summer \nof 2020 to move the United States permanently. He plans to sell the condominium in \nwhich he lives. He also plans on cashing out his retirement benefits and transferring the \nassets to a U.S.-based bank account. (Tr. 18-20, 23-25, 27, 31-34, 51-54, 26; GE 1)  \n \nSince immigrating to the United States, Applicant has traveled to China every \nyear. She and her son last visited in the summer of 2019. Each visit lasts approximately \ntwo weeks. Applicant spends the time visiting with her mother and two brothers. She \nreports each trip to her employer as required and completes the required security \nbriefings upon her departure and return. Applicant\u2019s mother, 85, is a retired engineer. \nShe has her own home, but spends time in the homes of Applicant\u2019s brother and \nApplicant\u2019s husband. Applicant\u2019s brothers are also trained as engineers. Her older \nbrother works for a private company. Her younger brother works as a subcontractor for \nprivate companies. Applicant does not provide any financial support to her Chinese \nrelatives. (Tr. 22-23, 26, 39-41, 43, 55, 57; GE 1) \n \nApplicant does not have any China-based assets. She owns her home in the \nUnited States, which is currently valued at $600,000. She also has between $250,000 \nand $300,000 in her retirement savings. (Tr. 35-37, 39, 58) \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites  \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n  \n \n  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests, including . . . business, financial and property \ninterests, are a national security concern if they result in a divided allegiance [or] . . . \nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) An assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign interest is \nlocated, including but not limited to, consideration such as whether it is known to target \nU.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or associated with a risk of \nterrorism.   \n \n \nChinese actors are the world\u2019s most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic espionage against the United States. In the defense industry, foreign-born \nengineers and scientists play a critical role in developing and implementing new \ntechnology and that technology may be of interest to others whose interests are \ncontrary to the United States. One method employed by the Chinese government relies \non the exploitation of Chinese nationals in research positions. The Chinese \ngovernment\u2019s poor human rights towards its citizens also has the potential to create a \nsource of vulnerability for Applicant. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationships and ongoing \ncontact with individuals who are residents and citizens of China create a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. Foreign \ninfluence disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(a) applies. Although Applicant has significant \nU.S- based assets and is rooted to the United States by the presence of her teenage \nson, these ties are not sufficient to mitigate the foreign influence concerns. None of the \nforeign influence mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d). A finding that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by her \nrelationships with her Chinese-national relatives does not suggest that Applicant is \nuntrustworthy or unreliable. It is not a finding that Applicant is unable to follow the rules \nregarding the proper handling and safeguarding classified information. The evidence \nestablishes that Applicant has properly reported her foreign contacts and foreign travel \nas required by her employer. At the hearing, she testified candidly about her foreign \ncontacts, travel, and the activities of her Chinese-national relatives  \n \n \nIn cases such as this one, the Government need not prove an applicant is a bad \nperson before it can deny or revoke access to classified information. Even good people \ncan pose a security risk because of facts and circumstances not under their control \u2013 \nsuch as having close relatives who are citizens or residents of foreign countries. (ISCR \nCase No.01-26893 at 8 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002); See also Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 527-28 (1988). Applicant\u2019s familial relationships with Chinese nationals \npresents an unacceptable security risk given the Chinese government\u2019s acts of \nespionage against the United States. As a result, Applicant should not be placed in a \nposition where she might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and \na desire to assist her relatives living in China who might be coerced by entities \noperating in that country. \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n",

A Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nwas issued under Guideline F, financial considerations, due to delinquent student loans \nand other delinquent debt. He provided sufficient evidence addressing his financial \ndifficulties. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.  \n \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 14, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). (SOR Response) On December 11, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on January 15, 2020.  \n \nFour Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 4) and seven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 G) \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open following the \nhearing to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On February 7, 2020, six \nadditional documents were received and admitted into evidence without objection as Ex. \nH \u2013 M. On March 11, 2020, an additional document was received and admitted into \nevidence without objection as Ex. N.

(Tr. 19, 38) His \nannual salary is $71,000. (Tr. 38) He is not married. (Ex. 1) After obtaining his current job, \nhe used his salary to address debts not listed in the SOR including credit card accounts, \nmedical accounts, truck payment, and loans, and he started addressing his student loan \nobligations. (Tr. 44) He asserted he was not neglecting his other debts. (Tr. 44) \n \nApplicant has not served in the military. He was unemployed from October 2017 \nthrough July 2018. He had been laid off due to a slowdown in work. (Tr. 33) During his \nunemployment, he used funds from a severance package of a few thousand dollars, \nunemployment compensation, saved funds, and money borrowed from his mother to \ncontinue making payments on his obligations. (Tr. 36) During the period of \nunemployment, he moved back in with his parents to save expenses. (Tr. 34) In July \n2018, he obtained a position as an estimator with an annual salary of $65,000. (Tr. 35) \nHe used part of his salary to repay the money borrowed from his mother. (Tr. 36)  \n \nIn 2009, Applicant obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree. Prior to his graduation, he \nobtained a number of student loans to pay for his education. (Tr. 30) He is currently \nenrolled in a three-year study program leading to a master\u2019s degree paid for by his \nemployer. (Tr. 31)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he denied all of the delinquent obligations \nexcept for two student loan obligations. (SOR Response) He indicated a number of the \naccounts had been paid, a number had been reconsolidated, and he was working with \nthe Department of Education to bring his student loan account back into good standing. \nAt the time of his response, he was waiting for documentation to support his assertions. \n \n\n \n3 \nThe SOR alleges seven past-due accounts that totaled $1,119, ten collection \naccounts that totaled approximately $15,000, and a student loan account (SOR 1.q) of \n$47,772 that was placed for collection. Six of the past-due accounts, for which he was \napproximately $700 past due, was owed the same creditor. Additionally, another single \ncreditor was owed six collection accounts (SOR 1.a \u20131.f) totaling $14,205 are owed the \nsame creditor. Fourteen of the eighteen delinquent accounts in the SOR were student \nloans. In November 2019, his Direct Loan Consolidation including the six student loan \naccounts listed in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f, was completed. (Ex. A. Tr. 21) He has a $405 monthly \npayment on the consolidation loan with the payment being made by automatic draft. (Tr. \n21, 45) In 2005, 2006, and 2007, he satisfied the smaller student loan obligations listed \nin SOR 1.j \u2013 1.p. (Ex. J, Tr. 47)  \n \nOnly four of the SOR delinquent obligations were for other than student loans. In \nAugust 2019, the telephone account (SOR 1.g, $191) that had been in collection, for \nservice at an apartment where he once lived with his brother, was paid in August 2019. \n(Ex. B, Tr. 22) The account was the last month\u2019s telephone bill and came due after \nApplicant had moved from the location. (Tr. 23) Applicant never received a copy of the \nbill and believed his brother had paid it. (Tr. 23)  \n \nIn August 2018, Applicant made a repayment agreement to repay the credit card \naccount (SOR 1.i, $413) that had been in collection. (Ex. C) He made $100 monthly \npayments between August 2018 and January 2019 for a total of $613 in payments. (Ex. \nC, Tr. 24) As of March 2019, the account had a zero balance. (Ex. C) In May 2018, he \npaid the medical debt listed in SOR 1.r ($351). (Ex. E, Tr. 26) The SOR lists a $60 medical \ndebt (SOR 1.h). Applicant is unaware of the origin of this debt and has been attempting \nto gain information about the source of the obligation so it can be addressed. (Tr. 28) \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant starting making $532 monthly payments on his $47,772 \nstudent loan (SOR 1.q). (Ex. D) As of January 2020, the amount owed on this debt had \nbeen reduced to $43,696 through the repayment agreement. (Ex. M) In February 2020, \nan additional monthly payment of $532 was made. (Ex. O) \n \nApplicant was working on addressing his $2,739 student loan (SOR 1. k). The SOR \nindicated this debt had been $428 past due. Since March 2019, Applicant has been \nmaking $405 monthly payments on another student loan. (Ex. G, Ex. K, Tr. 27, 50) Since \nthen until November 2019, the balance on the loan has been reduced from $2,167 to \n$1,134. (Ex. G) In December 2019 and January 2020, two additional payments of $405 \nwere made, reducing the outstanding balance to $324. (Ex. K, Ex. L) \n \nApplicant makes regular contributions to his company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. \n39) He has approximately $3,500 in his checking and savings accounts. (Tr. 41) He has \nno vehicle payments. He has reviewed his credit reports and has received on-line \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 51) He has created a monthly budget and is willing and able to \npay his debts. (Ex. H, Ex. I, Tr. 53, 60)  \n\n \n4 \nApplicant\u2019s direct manager stated Applicant works thoroughly to meet customer \nrequirements. Applicant checks with co-workers to confirm all procedures and processes \nare correctly followed. (Ex. F, Tr. 27)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n5 \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n\n \n6 \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nPrior to 2009, Applicant obtained student loans in order to pay for his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He was current on his debt payments until becoming unemployed in October \n2017. His unemployment lasted until July 2018. While unemployed, he used funds from \na severance package, unemployment compensation, saved funds, and money borrowed \nfrom his mother to continue making payments on his obligations. Additionally, during this \nperiod, he moved back in with his parents to save money. In July 2018, he obtained a \nposition as an estimator with an annual salary of $65,000. At that time, he started repaying \nthe money borrowed from his mother, and making payments on his credit card accounts, \nmedical accounts, his truck payment, and other loans, and he started addressing his \nstudent loan obligations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because the debts were incurred some time ago and Applicant \nhas acted reasonably by making payments on his delinquent obligations. He is still \nattempting to locate the holder of a small $60 medical collection account. AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies because Applicant experienced a period of unemployment from October 2017 \nthrough July 2018. Once he had a job, he began repaying his creditors. This shows that \nhe has acted responsibility under the circumstances. \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that he has paid each of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to show that he has a plan to resolve his \ndebts and that he has taken significant steps to implement his plan. This he has done. He \nhas paid off several of his debts and is making monthly payments on his remaining \nstudent loans. \n\n \n7 \nWhile Applicant is credited with obtaining financial counseling online, not enough \nis known about the counseling to conclude that it satisfies AG \u00b6 20(c).However, AG \u00b6 \n20(c) applies in part because there are clear indications that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies because he paid the telephone \nservice debt (SOR 1.g), the credit card debt (SOR 1.i), the medical debt (SOR 1.r), some \nof his student loan debts (SOR 1.j through 1.p), and he is making monthly payments on \nhis remaining student loan debts (SOR 1.a through 1.f and 1.q). \n \nApplicant\u2019s other existing debt obligations are being paid on time. The $60 medical \ncollection debt and remains unaddressed, but it is not sufficiently large enough to result \nin a security concern. Applicant has made substantial progress toward resolving the \nissues of concern to the DoD. Under all of these circumstances, Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial consideration security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant provided extensive \nevidence of payments, payment plans, and additional action to resolve the delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. Many of the obligations were paid prior to the issuance of the \nSOR. His actions show he has acted with financial responsibility. Questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information have been \nmitigated. The record shows good judgment and a willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. He currently maintains a monthly budget and reviews his credit reports. He \n\n \n8 \nis willing and able to pay his debts. Applicant has amply demonstrated that he can be \ncounted on to fulfill his obligations, and his financial situation is stable. \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014the \nmajority of his delinquent obligations are being addressed\u2014it is whether Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See \nAG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about his \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.r: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on November 26, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 6, \n2020. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n\n \n2 \n \n(NOH) on March 3, 2020, scheduling the hearing for March 11, 2020. Applicant waived \nthe 15-day hearing notice required by the Directive. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n(Tr. at 72) \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified; he did not call any witnesses or present any documentation. \nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until April 8, 2020, and he presented \ndocumentation which I collectively marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and admitted in \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 17, \n2020. (Tr. at 15-19) \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations except \u00b6 1.f, which he \ndenied. He is 31 years old, single, and does not have children. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 9; GE \n1) \n \n \n Applicant graduated from high school in 2007. He then served in the U.S. military \nfrom 2007 until he was honorably discharged in September 2015. He was discharged \nfrom the National Guard (NG) in late 2017. As of the date of the hearing, he worked as \nan aircraft mechanic for his employer, a DOD contractor, since September 2018. He was \nfirst granted a security clearance in 2008. (Tr. at 5-7, 21-25, 36-38; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent consumer accounts totaling $32,761 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n- 1.e) and a delinquent $358 U.S. Government overpayment (SOR \u00b6 1.f). The debts are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and 2018 and 2019 credit reports. Applicant also \ndisclosed and discussed his debts in his 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and \nduring his 2019 background interview. (GE 1-4) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debt to a period of self-employment from \nFebruary to July 2016 and a period of underemployment from July 2016 to September \n2018. Having worked as a truck driver from September 2015 to February 2016, he formed \nan owner-operator business in which he was contracted by a company to haul \nrecreational vehicles (RVs) from the manufacturer to dealerships around the country. To \ndo so, he purchased a business vehicle for which he was responsible for carrying \ninsurance, as further discussed below. He earned approximately $8,000 monthly during \nthis period of self-employment. (Tr. at 21-77; GE 1, 4) \n \nIn May 2016, Applicant\u2019s anticipated two-week NG training unexpectedly lasted for \nfive weeks. He did not earn income from his business during this period and he did not \nget paid for his NG training until September 2016. When he returned from NG training, \nthe company to which he was contracted did not provide him with as many RV units to \nhaul. He was consequently unable to make the monthly payments on his business \nvehicle, it was repossessed in around September 2016, and his business faltered. He \nthen worked on an as-needed basis for $15 hourly in home entertainment installation, \nand he supplemented his income as a ride share service driver. From approximately July \n2017 to September 2018, he worked for a fast food restaurant in which he earned $28,000 \n\n \n3 \n \nannually as a shift leader and then $40,000 annually as a general manager. He also \nincurred $5,000 in out-of-pocket expenses for his cross-country move in 2018 for his \ncurrent employment. (Tr. at 21-77; GE 1, 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a $28,081 charged-off automobile account related to Applicant\u2019s \npurchase of a business vehicle, as previously discussed. Applicant financed \napproximately $72,000 in February 2016 to purchase an $80,000 truck. When he \npurchased this vehicle, he turned in two other vehicles and made a minimal down \npayment. Within the cross-country RV hauling community, it was common business \npractice to purchase a vehicle that was reliable and served as a place to sleep. His \nmonthly payment was $1,300. He received delinquent notifications by e-mail when he did \nnot make his monthly payments, beginning in around May 2016. The vehicle was \nrepossessed in September 2016. He did not learn that his outstanding balance after \nrepossession was $28,081 until he checked his credit report and communicated with the \ncreditor in early to mid-2017. As of the date of the hearing, he had not yet taken action to \nresolve this account because he lacked the financial means to do so. Additionally, he \nfocused on addressing his daily living expenses to ensure he did not incur additional \ndelinquent debt and was paying his smaller delinquent SOR debts, as discussed below. \nHe intends to resolve this debt. (Tr. at 24-36, 38, 71-72, 74; GE 1, 2, 3, 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a social group membership account, placed for collection for \n$2,635. Applicant signed paperwork for a one-year membership with the group in July \n2017. He attended the group\u2019s events and paid its monthly membership dues for three \nmonths, after which time he stopped attending the group\u2019s events but was still charged \nfor the remaining dues. He did not understand the one-year financial commitment he \nmade when he joined the group. He provided documentation reflecting that he paid this \naccount in March 2020. (Tr. at 38-41, 73-74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a cellular wireless account placed for collection for $1,077. \nApplicant believed he paid this account before he switched carriers in 2015. He first \nbecame aware that it was delinquent when he observed it on his credit report in late 2018, \nat which point he telephoned the underlying creditor and was told that they did not have \na record of the account. After he received the SOR, he telephoned the collection agency \nand unsuccessfully disputed the outstanding amount. He began receiving delinquency \nnotices from the collection agency in February 2020. He intended to resolve this account \nwith his anticipated tax refund for tax year 2019. He provided documentation reflecting \nthat this collections account was removed from his credit bureau report between March \n27 and April 2, 2020. (Tr. at 41-44, 71, 73-74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a supermarket credit card placed for collection for $493. Applicant \nused this credit card for both business and personal expenses. It became delinquent in \naround July or August 2016. He provided documentation reflecting that he settled and \npaid this card in March 2020. (Tr. at 44-46, 71, 74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a credit card placed for collection for $475. Applicant could not \nrecall when this card first became delinquent. He provided documentation reflecting that \nhe settled and paid this card in March 2020. (Tr. at 46-48, 71, 74; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a U.S. Government life insurance overpayment that was placed \nfor collection for $358. Applicant recalled receiving a notice from the U.S. Government \nbetween approximately February and April 2019, indicating that the overpayment was \nresolved through a garnishment of his income tax refund for tax year 2018. This debt is \nonly reflected in Applicant\u2019s October 2018 credit report; it is not reflected in his most recent \ncredit report from June 2019. (Tr. at 48-49; GE 2, 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant has earned $70,000 annually, or a net income of $4,000 monthly, since \nSeptember 2018. His monthly rent is $600. He owns two cars, a $15,000 truck that he \nfinanced with a five-year loan in July 2017, and a $29,000 compact crossover that he \nfinanced with a $25,000 five-year loan in April 2019. His truck and insurance payments \nwere $525 and $125 monthly, respectively, and he withdrew $4,000 from his retirement \nsavings account to pay his truck loan in 2019 so that he could have more disposable \nincome. He is current on his payments of $500 monthly for his compact crossover and \ninsurance of $100 monthly. He has a credit card with a $400 limit, which he uses to rebuild \nhis credit. He tries to set aside his estimated monthly net remainder of $600 for savings, \nand had $600 in savings as of the date of the hearing. He has used a tax preparation \ncompany to file his taxes and was current on his annual income tax filings; he also paid \nthe taxes associated with his $4,000 withdrawal from his retirement savings account.  He \nreceived financial counseling when he was discharged from the U.S. military, and he \nmonitors his credit by checking his credit report. He does not have any other delinquent \ndebt. (Tr. at 21-22, 51-70, 74; GE 4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c).  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financing of $72,000 towards the purchase of an $80,000 business \nvehicle was not a condition beyond his control. His decision to purchase such a vehicle, \nhowever, was motivated by the common business practice within the cross-country RV \nhauling community of purchasing a reliable vehicle that also served as a place to sleep. \nHe made his monthly payments of $1,300 from February to May 2016, when his ability to \ncontinue to do so was impeded by conditions beyond his control. Thus, the first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. With his limited income, he prioritized his \nexpenses and took steps to pay his smaller delinquent debts. While he could have taken \nsuch efforts sooner had he used his discretionary income to pay his delinquent debts after \nhe purchased a car in 2017, instead of buying a second car in 2019, he nonetheless \nresolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f.   \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant received financial counseling in 2015. He is current on his annual income tax \nfilings. He does not have any other delinquent debts. With his monthly net remainder of \napproximately $600, he has the capacity and intends to resolve the sole remaining debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant credibly testified \nat the hearing that he intended to resolve his remaining delinquent debt and take the \nnecessary steps to avoid future financial delinquencies. I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:    \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/02/2020 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 28, 2018. On October \n10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \nApplicant received the SOR on October 30, 2019; answered it in an undated \ndocument; and requested a decision on the written record without a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on February 11, 2020, and sent a \n\n \n2 \n \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant, who was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on February 20, 2020, and submitted a \nmulti-page document, which was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A and admitted in \nevidence without objection from Department Counsel. The case was assigned to me on \nMay 12, 2020.  \n \n \nThe FORM included a summary of an interview of Applicant conducted by a \nsecurity investigator in January 2019. (FORM Item 3.) The interview summary was not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant \nthat he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the interview summary; make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the interview \nsummary on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant submitted a detailed \nresponse to the FORM but did not comment on the accuracy or completeness of the \ninterview summary, nor did he object to it. I conclude that he waived any objections to the \ninterview summary. Although pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they \nare expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the \nDirective. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.d-1.i and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. I have treated his admission of \nSOR \u00b6 1.e as a denial for the reasons set out below. His admissions in his answer are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor. He was \nunemployed from December 2007 to February 2009. He served on active duty in the U.S. \nMarine Corps from February 2009 to February 2013 and received an honorable \ndischarge. He was unemployed from February 2013 to September 2015, while attending \nschool and being financially supported by the GI Bill. He was employed in the private \nsector from September 2015 until he was hired by his current employer in January 2018. \nHe received a security clearance in July 2009, while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps. \n \n \nApplicant married in July 2012 and divorced in January 2015. He has a five-year-\nold child. The record does not reflect whether he is obligated to pay child support. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $31,977. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from February 2020, August 2019, and October 2018. (FORM \nItems 4, 5, and 6.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: car loan charged off for $4,606. This loan was for a car that Applicant \npurchased in May 2014. The car was a total loss after an accident in 2016. Applicant \nbelieved that his auto insurance would pay off the loan, but the amount paid by the \ninsurance company apparently was less than the balance on the loan. During the January \n2019 security interview, Applicant admitted that he had received some collection \n\n \n3 \n \nattempts, but he attributed these attempts to the insurance company\u2019s delay in paying off \nthe loan. (FORM Item 3 at 4.) He settled the remaining balance on the car loan for less \nthan the full amount in March 2020. (AX A at 1.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: telecommunication bill charged off for $211. This debt was for \nunreturned equipment. It was charged off in April 2017. Applicant paid it in full in February \n2020. (AX A at 21.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: car loan placed for collection of $4,606. This debt is a duplicate of \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for the same amount to \nthe same creditor, and the nine-digit account number alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is the same \nas the first nine digits in the account number alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: installment sales contract charged off for $1,260. This account was \nopened in November 2009, while Applicant was on active duty in the Marine Corps, and \nthe debt was charged off in June 2012. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that \nthis debt was settled. The October 2018 credit report reflects that the account is closed \nbut does not indicate that it was resolved. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) The debt is not reflected \nin the August 2019 and February 2020 credit reports.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: jewelry store account placed for collection of $9,934. In his answer \nto the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt but contended that it was for jewelry he ordered \nbut never received. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had contacted the creditor \nin an effort to settle the debt. The October 2018 credit report reflected that the debt was \ndisputed. In his response to the FORM, he included a press release from the state \nattorney general announcing the conviction of the owner of the jewelry store for felony \nconspiracy to engage in illegal financing and debt-collection practices targeting sailors \nand marines. The owner of the jewelry store was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three \nyears of felony probation, ordered to pay restitution to victims, and required to cancel the \noutstanding debts incurred by victims. (AX A at 42-44.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: collection account for $7,712. This debt was for early termination of \na lease. During his security interview in January 2019, Applicant told the investigator that \nhe was uncomfortable living in an apartment after he learned that a previous occupant \nhad died there. He requested that he be allowed to move into another apartment in the \nsame complex. When his request was denied, he moved out of the apartment six months \nbefore the end of the lease term and stopped paying rent. (FORM Item 3 at 4.) In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that the debt was resolved, but he submitted \nno documentary evidence to support his claim. Applicant received an offer in 2019 to \nsettle the debt for $3,900, payable by May 7, 2019. (AX A at 25.) However, he submitted \nno evidence that he paid the agreed amount by the due date. The debt is not reflected in \na credit report dated January 30, 2020, submitted by Applicant in response to the FORM, \nor in the credit report dated February 7, 2020, included in the FORM. (FORM Item 4; AX \nA at 29-41.). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: telecommunications account placed for collection of $2,133. This \ndebt, a cellphone account, was placed for collection in March 2017. It was settled for less \nthan the full amount in March 2020. (AX A at 22.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: collection account for $1,395. This debt was referred for collection \nin July 2018. The nature of the debt is not reflected in the record. In Applicant\u2019s answer, \nhe stated that the debt was paid in full. When he was interviewed by a security investigator \nin January 2019, he told the investigator that he paid the debt in November 2018. He did \nnot provide documentary evidence of payment in his answer to the SOR or his response \nto the FORM. The debt is reflected in the October 2018 credit report (FORM Item 6 at 9), \nbut it is not reflected in the credit reports from August 2019 and February 2020 (FORM \nItems 5 and 6), nor is it reflected in the February 2020 credit report submitted by Applicant \nin his response to the FORM. (AX A at 29-41.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: insurance debt placed for collection of $120. In the January 2019 \nsecurity interview, Applicant admitted that this debt was referred for collection in 2017. \n(FORM Item 3 at 4.) It was paid in full in March 2020. (AX A at 20.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\n \n5 \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c allege the same debt. When the same conduct is alleged twice \nin the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) \n(same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, because the creditor\u2019s \nfraudulent conduct was a condition beyond his control, and he acted responsibly by \ncontacting the creditor and filing a dispute with the credit bureau. However, this mitigating \ncondition is not established for the other debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment from December 2007 to February 2009 occurred before any of the debts \nalleged in the SOR were incurred. His unemployment from February 2013 to September \n2015 was a voluntary choice and not a condition beyond his control. The car accident that \nwas the cause of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a could have been a condition largely \nbeyond his control, depending on the circumstances and the degree to which Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \nwas at fault. However, he has not established that it was a condition largely beyond his \ncontrol, because he provided no information about the circumstances in which it occurred. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial situation is not yet under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Although Applicant has been continuously employed \nsince September 2015, he did not resolve the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b until February \n2020, and he did not resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.g, and 1.i until March \n2020, after he was questioned about his debts by a security investigator in January 2019 \nand received the SOR in October 2019. Payment of debts under pressure to obtain or \nretain a security clearance does not constitute \u201cgood faith.\u201d An applicant who waits until \nhis clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). Applicant claimed that he had resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.h, but he provided no documentation supporting his claim. The debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.h are not reflected in recent credit reports. However, the fact that a \ndebt no longer appears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent \nevidence as to the disposition of the debt. Debts may fall off credit reports for various \nreasons, including the passage of time. See ISCR Case No. 18-01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. \n13, 2019). Applicant submitted evidence that he received a settlement offer for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but he submitted no evidence that he accepted the offer and paid \nthe agreed amount. When an applicant claims to have resolved a debt, he or she is \nexpected to present documentary evidence supporting that claim. See ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He admitted this debt \nin his answer to the SOR but stated that he had not received the items he had ordered. \nHe disputed the debt, and he provided evidence of fraudulent conduct by the creditor in \nhis response to the FORM. This mitigating condition is not established for the other debts \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant submitted no evidence that he disputed any of the debts \nwith the original creditor, the collection agencies, or the credit-reporting bureaus.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n8 \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the U.S. Marine \nCorps and his recent efforts to resolve his delinquent debts. He has resolved several of \nhis delinquent debts, but he has not yet established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a \nhearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, and 1.f-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn September 13, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. (HE 2) On \nOctober 3, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3)    \n \nOn November 20, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On November \n26, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On December 20, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for January \n16, 2020. (HE 1C) The hearing was cancelled, and on January 17, 2020, it was \nrescheduled for February 6, 2020. (HE 1A; HE 1B) The hearing was held as rescheduled \non February 6, 2020.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, and Applicant \nobjected to admissibility of three credit reports because he believed they were inaccurate. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 19-22; GE 2-4) Applicant said he was the victim of identity theft; his credit \nreport contained some debts that were not his debts; and he employed a credit repair \ncompany (CRC1) to help with his credit. (Tr. 19) He said, \u201cI was in limbo trying to figure \nout what I was responsible for and what I wasn\u2019t. Some things [on his credit report] I just \nknow I didn\u2019t personally put on my credit.\u201d (Tr. 19) Applicant\u2019s objection went to the weight \nand not the admissibility of his credit reports, and I overruled his objection. (Tr. 19-22; GE \n1-4) Applicant was provided a full opportunity to challenge the individual entries on his \ncredit report during and after his hearing. Applicant offered one exhibit; there was no \nobjection; and Applicant\u2019s exhibit was admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 21-22; \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A)  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request for additional time to submit documentation. On \nFebruary 19, 2020, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. I received two post-hearing \nexhibits, which were admitted into evidence without objection. (AE B, AE C) The record \ninitially closed on March 6, 2020. (Tr. 71) On March 9, 2020, I received comments from \nDepartment Counsel about Applicant\u2019s exhibits. (HE 4) Applicant requested, and on \nMarch 7, 2020, I approved an extension until March 13, 2020, to enable Applicant to \npresent evidence about his income tax returns and student loans. (AE D) Applicant did \nnot provide any documentation after March 7, 2020. \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR decisions and the \nDirective are available at https://ogc.osd.mil/doha/isp.html.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.m. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old information technology specialist, and he has been \nemployed by his current DOD contractor since October 2019. (Tr. 6, 9) In 2006, he \ngraduated from high school, and in 2013, he received a bachelor of science degree in \nmanagement communication systems. (Tr. 7) In 2016, he received a master\u2019s degree in \ncomputer science and information technology. (Tr. 8-9, 25) He served in the Army from \n2007 to present, including an 11-month tour in Iraq from April 2009 to February 2010 as \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \na combat engineer. (Tr. 7; GE 2) He is a sergeant (E-5) in the Army National Guard, and \nhis current military occupational specialty (MOS) is military police resettlement specialist. \n(Tr. 7-8) His highest military award is an Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM). (Tr. 8) \nHe has never married, and he does not have any children. (Tr. 9-10) \n  \nFinancial Considerations \n \nIn the past three years, Applicant was unemployed once and that was for two \nmonths in 2019. (Tr. 9, 29-31) He said he was the victim of identity theft. (Tr. 24) In 2017, \nhe employed CRC1 to correct his credit reports. (Tr. 62, 33-35, 64-65; GE 2 at 7) He also \nreceived some financial counseling from CRC1. (Tr. 62-63) He wanted CRC1 to arrange \nconsolidation of his verified debts; however, the CRC1 was too slow. (Tr. 32-33) In March \n2018, he ended his employment of CRC1, and he decided that his sister-in-law was a \nbetter choice to handle his debt resolution. (Tr. 33, 65) Based on his sister-in-law\u2019s advice, \nhe decided to pay one debt at a time. (Tr. 33-34, 66) He learned about most of the \ndelinquent debts on his SOR in 2017 when he employed CRC1 to repair his credit. (Tr. \n32, 35) He has a written budget. (Tr. 67)  \n \nApplicant provided an agreement with a different credit repair company (CRC2) \ndated February 11, 2020; however, the agreement was unsigned. (AE C) In return for a \nflat fee of $1,200, CRC2 agreed to provide the following services: (1) assess Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent financial situation; (2) provide a detailed review of his income, assets, and \nexpenses; (3) provide personalized options based on his goals, which may include social \nservice referrals, educational materials and resources, and a debt management plan; and \n(4) assist with either a debt management plan or debt consolidation. (AE C) \n \nApplicant did not provide any documentation to corroborate his hearing statement \nthat he paid any of his debts. He said he paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l, and \nthose three debts were removed from his most recent credit report. The other SOR debts \nthat he said were resolved were still listed on his most recent credit report of record.     \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling $27,598 as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant has a utility debt placed for collection for $255. \nApplicant said he owed the debt. (Tr. 32-34) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.m allege, and \nApplicant admitted that he has three medical accounts placed for collection for $84, $212, \nand $97. (Tr. 34-36, 53; HE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant has a charged-off telecommunications debt for \n$848. (Tr. 28) Applicant contacted the creditor and learned the debt was sold to another \ncreditor, and he asked about settling the debt. (Tr. 36-37) He did not indicate the creditor \nproposed a settlement amount.   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f allege that Applicant has two debts placed for collection that \nare owed to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for $875 and $286. The VA overpaid \nApplicant for his tuition. (Tr. 38) Applicant said the two debts were paid when the VA \nreceived his Army National Guard drill pay. (Tr. 38-39) The two debts are still shown as \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \ndelinquent on his most recent credit report. He did not provide Army National Guard \nrecords showing any payments to the VA. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant has a charged-off bank debt for $1,160. Applicant \nadmitted responsibility for the debt, and he said he had not made any payments to the \ncreditor. (Tr. 41-42) He planned to pay the debt. (Tr. 42) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant has a charged-off debt for $22,330. In 2014, \nApplicant borrowed funds to enable his sister to have a vehicle, and Applicant is the only \nborrower on the loan agreement. (GE 2 at 7; GE 3) His sister told Applicant that she would \npay the debt. In 2016, she defaulted on the loan, and in 2017, the vehicle was \nrepossessed. (GE 2 at 7; GE 3) His August 19, 2019 credit report indicates the charged-\noff amount was $22,330. (GE 3) Applicant\u2019s June 27, 2018 Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) states that Applicant planned to \nresolve the $7,000 debt with a lump-sum payment by April 2019. (GE 2 at 7) Payment \nwas delayed because Applicant wanted to verify that the creditor seeking payment was \nactually the creditor holding the debt. (Tr. 43-46) On January 2, 2020, the creditor wrote \nthe outstanding balance is $14,035; the creditor offered to settle the debt for $2,105; and \nApplicant was offered the option of making six $351 monthly payments to resolve the \ndebt. (AE A) At his hearing, Applicant said he intended to make his first payment after his \nhearing on February 22, 2020. (Tr. 48, 72) Department Counsel reminded Applicant about \nproviding proof of the $351 payment. (AE B) However, the record closed on March 13, \n2020, and he did not provide proof of the first $351 payment.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant has a charged-off bank card debt for $913. \nApplicant admitted responsibility for this debt. (Tr. 49; HE 3) SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that \nApplicant has a store credit card placed for collection for $279. Applicant said he paid the \ndebt in 2018, and CRC1 was able to get it removed from his credit report. (Tr. 50) \nApplicant\u2019s August 19, 2019 credit report does not include the SOR \u00b6 1.j debt, and \nApplicant is credited with paying it. (GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges that Applicant has a telecommunications debt placed for \ncollection for $151. Applicant said he paid the debt in 2018. (GE 2) He also said the debt \nwas resolved when he turned in cable equipment. (Tr. 51-52) This debt does not appear \non his August 19, 2019 credit report, and Applicant is credited with resolving it. (GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant has an insurance debt placed for collection for \n$108. Applicant said he paid the debt in 2018; he disputed his responsibility for this debt; \nand it was removed from his credit report. (Tr. 52-53; GE 2; GE 3) Applicant is credited \nwith resolving this debt. \n \nIn addition to the SOR-alleged debts, Applicant is making payments on a state tax \ndebt that resulted from an error in his tax return for tax year 2014. (Tr. 54) When he began \nmaking payments, he owed $2,200. (Tr. 54) Payments are being taken out of his \npaycheck, and he currently owes $770. (Tr. 54) Applicant has student loans totaling about \n$50,000 that are in deferment. (Tr. 69-70; GE 3) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of \nIRS Form 1040s for the last five years, documentation showing the status of his state tax \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \ndebt, his request for deferment of his student loans, and any approval of deferment of his \nstudent loans. (Tr. 70-73) After his hearing, Applicant provided a document showing he \nwas applying for an Income-Driven Repayment plan to address his student loans. (AE B) \nHe did not provide the previous request for deferment, and I reiterated my request for a \ncopy of his student loan deferral and approval. (AE D) Applicant traveled to Panama in \n2017 and to Jamaica in 2018 for tourism. (Tr. 58-60; GE 2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s June 27, 2018 OPM personal subject interview provided notice to \nApplicant of the delinquent status of several accounts. (GE 2) For several of the debts, \nhe indicated CRC1 was resolving the debts. (GE 2) For others, he said he was unaware \nof the delinquent debts. (GE 2)   \n \nApplicant emphasized that he has been in the Army for 13 years, and he is \npursuing promotion to staff sergeant. (Tr. 24) He needs a security clearance for his Army \nemployment and his DOD-contractor employment. (Tr. 24, 29-30) He intended to improve \nhis financial decisions and financial responsibility. (Tr. 24-25)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cIt means such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation omitted). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nevidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Applicant paid, settled, \nor resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j ($279), 1.k ($151), and 1.l ($108). He sought financial \nassistance from CRC1, his sister-in-law, and CRC2. (AE C) He received some financial \ncounseling, and he generated a budget. He indicated his finances were harmed through \nidentity theft; however, he did not indicate any of the specific debts on his SOR were the \nproduct of identity theft. He did not prove that identity theft adversely affected his finances. \nHe did not provide evidence that his financial problems were largely beyond his control \nand that he acted reasonably under the circumstances. He did not describe any lengthy \nperiod of unemployment or reduction in his income in the last three years. He received \nample warning through the OPM PSI and SOR of the security issue pertaining to the \ndelinquent debts and his finances. His June 27, 2018 OPM PSI states that Applicant \nplanned to resolve the $7,000 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h with a lump-sum payment by April 2019. \nHowever, as of the date of his hearing, he did not provide proof of any payments to \naddress this debt.  \n \nThe timing of the resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts is a pertinent consideration. The \nAppeal Board has observed, \u201cApplicants who begin to resolve their debts only after having \nbeen placed on notice that their clearances or trustworthiness designations are in \njeopardy may be disinclined to follow rules and regulations when their personal interests \nare not at stake.\u201d ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent SOR debts totaling $27,598, after deducting the \nthree debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l, 10 debts totaling $27,060 remained. The SOR \ndebt in \u00b6 1.h was listed for $22,330; however, the debt was actually $14,035. The creditor \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h offered to settle the $14,035 debt for $2,105. He did not establish that he \nwas unable to make greater progress sooner paying or resolving these 10 debts.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that his student loans and income taxes raised a \nsecurity concern. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be \nconsidered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Without supporting documentation, the \nstatus, rationale for deferment, and payment history of Applicant\u2019s $50,000 student loan \ndebt is unclear. He said he had a student loan deferment; however, he did not provide \ndocumentation showing the basis for deferment. Instead, he sent documentation showing \nhe was requesting a student loan payment plan. The record does not show his student \nloans were delinquent, and if so, the magnitude of the delinquency. He said he was \nmaking payments on a state tax debt from 2014. I requested state and federal tax returns \nto show the status of his taxes and to show his annual income; however, he did not provide \nthe requested tax information.  \n \n\u201c[I]t is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about \nthe resolution of specific debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02912 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2018) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016)). \u201cThis implies something \nthat independently substantiates the resolution of debts.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03462 at 5 \nn.7 (App. Bd. Dec. 18, 2018) (noting absence of IRS tax transcripts and citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016)). Failure to provide requested financial \ninformation \u201cwithout explaining why it was that such a document was not available\u201d may \nundermine a determination that Applicant met his burden of persuasion. See ISCR Case \nNo. 16-02322 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018) (reversing grant of security clearance in part \ndue to failure of Applicant to provide an IRS tax transcript). \n \nThe non-SOR allegations do not necessarily establish a security concern as his \nrecent tax returns may have been timely filed and paid. His student loans may have been \nlegitimately deferred. The record did not include recent information about unemployment, \ncollege attendance, recent active duty military service, or other reasons for student loan \ndeferment. See Debt.org website, https://www.debt.org/students/forbearance-deferment/; \nNelNet website, https://www.nelnet.com/postpone-your-payments. Applicant has a \nresponsibility to provide reasonably available requested financial information, and failure \nto provide that information reduces mitigation. The issues of his taxes and student loans \nwill not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner resolving his delinquent SOR debts. There are not clear \nindications his financial problems are under control. Applicant failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old information technology specialist, and he has been \nemployed by the current DOD contractor since October 2019. In 2013, he received a \nbachelor of science degree in management communication systems, and in 2016, he \nreceived a master\u2019s degree in computer science and information technology. He served \nin the Army from 2007 to present, including an 11-month tour in Iraq from April 2009 to \nFebruary 2010 as a combat engineer. He is a sergeant in the Army National Guard, and \nhis current MOS is military police resettlement specialist. His highest military award is an \nARCOM. There is no evidence of violation of security rules or responsibilities while \nserving with U.S. forces in a combat zone. See ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. \nJan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d but commenting that \nsecurity concerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \n \nApplicant did not establish he was unable to make greater progress sooner \nresolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i and 1.m. His actions under the Appeal \nBoard jurisprudence are insufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all \nof which can raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate \nfinancial considerations security concerns.   \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j through 1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He was interviewed by a government investigator on June 20, 2018, \nand answered a set of interrogatories from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on September 16, 2019. After reviewing the information gathered during the \nbackground investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse) on November 22, 2019.

(\u00b6 1.a) His SOR admission and those at his hearing are incorporated as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He attended college \nbetween September 2000 and April 2002, but did not complete a degree. He then \nattended a trade-technical school (apprenticeship) between August 2003 and January \n2007, and qualified as a journeyman electrician.

Applicant has been working for federal contractors \nsince about 2004, and has possessed a security clearance since at least 2007. He has \nbeen working for his current employer and clearance sponsor since January 2007. \nApplicant submitted his most recent SCA on August 3, 2017. In his responses to \nQuestion 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed \nthat he illegally used marijuana between February 2015 and March 2017.

He \nindicated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because it was \u201cnot worth \nbeing in trouble/illegal and family more important.\u201d (GE 1) \nOn June 20, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a background investigator from \nthe Office of Personal Management (OPM). He confirmed to the interviewer his illegal \nuse and purchases of marijuana between February 2015 and March 2017, while \npossessing a clearance. He told the investigator that he smoked marijuana two to three \ntimes per month by himself. He stated that he did not use marijuana with anyone else \nand that he purchased the marijuana through random people (unknown names).

When \nasked how he obtained the marijuana, Applicant explained that between February 2015 \n(when he claimed he started using marijuana) and July 2016 (when he claimed he \npurchased marijuana for the first time) he \u201cbought the marijuana through the friend of a \nfriend.\u201d (Tr. 18) \nWhen confronted with the discrepancy about how he acquired the marijuana, that \nhe was using before he started purchasing it, Applicant testified: \nA: I apologize. I don't want to get anybody else in trouble. I did use \nmarijuana with a friend of mine. We both played guitar, I did do that a few \ntimes, and that was it. So I was able to get it through him. \nQ: \nOkay. So you used it with your friend? \nA: \nA couple of times, yes, when we worked together. \nQ: \nAll right, but most of the time you were alone? \nA: \nMost of the time I was alone. (Tr. 18) \nWhen asked to explain what he meant by \u201cgoing through a phase\u201d and why he \nsuddenly started to use marijuana in February 2015, after claiming he never used it \nbefore, Applicant testified: \nWhen I was introduced to it, I do play guitar and it enhanced the effect of \nme playing the guitar. So just like any drug, I guess once you try \nsomething you can sort of become addicted to it. Can I guess become \naddicted to it. So I did use it to enhance the effects of me playing the \nguitar or the piano anything like that. (Tr. 20) \nApplicant further explained that he used to play in a band. And, they went to \nshows and made money playing as a side-business. Because Applicant now has \nchildren, playing is more of a hobby for him. (Tr. 20) He used to smoke marijuana in his \nhome and at his parent\u2019s home. \nApplicant acknowledged that he has possessed a clearance since at least 2007, \nand that he was aware that the Government has a policy against people holding a \nclearance and using illegal drugs. He testified that he stopped smoking marijuana in \nMarch 2017, because he knew it was wrong, and he also believed that using marijuana \nwas beginning to adversely affect his memory. Applicant is still in contact with the friend \nwith whom he shared (smoked) and provided him with marijuana. (Tr. 22) He presented \nno evidence to show that he sought or received any medical or psychological treatment \nor counseling for substance abuse. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern for the illegal use of drugs: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nBetween February 2015 and March 2017, Applicant illegally purchased and used \nmarijuana while possessing a security clearance. He has possessed a clearance since \nat least 2007. He acknowledged knowing that the use of marijuana was illegal, and that \nthe Government has a policy against security clearance holders using illegal drugs. AG \n\u00b6 25 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe record established the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (c), and \n(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a securit\n \ny clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a history of illegal \nmarijuana purchase, possession, and use. Applicant illegally used marijuana between \nFebruary 2015 and March 2017, while possessing a security clearance. He knew that \nthe use of marijuana is illegal, and that the Government has a policy against people \nholding a clearance and using illegal drugs. He stopped smoking marijuana in March \n2017, because he knew it was wrong. \nApplicant was aware that the illegal use of marijuana would create a security \nconcern and adversely affect his eligibility for a clearance. Notwithstanding, Applicant \nillegally purchased, possessed, and used marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s purchase, possession, and use of marijuana cast doubts on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations, and suitability to hold a clearance, especially because his \nsubstance misuse occurred while he possessed a clearance. He was aware of the \ngovernment\u2019s policy against illegal drug use, and the adverse security consequences for \nsuch use. Nevertheless, he was unable or unwilling to stop using marijuana. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony demonstrates that he was less than \ncandid when he answered his 2017 SCA, and that he deliberately mislead or made \nfalse statements to the government investigator about the circumstances surrounding \nhis purchase and use of marijuana. Presumably, to protect his marijuana-using friend \nand facilitator. He also continues to associate with his marijuana-using friends. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nApplicant denied his intent to illegally purchase and use marijuana in the future. \nIn light of the record as a whole, I consider Applicant\u2019s statement to be unreliable and to \nlack credibility. Applicant knew the adverse security clearance consequences of his \nsubstance misuse, and that did not dissuade him. More time without recurrence of \nsubstance misuse is needed for Applicant to establish his reliability, trustworthiness, \nability to comply with laws rules and regulations, and suitability for a clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for a \nfederal contractor and possessed a security clearance since at least 2007. Applicant\u2019s \nlack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations continue to \nraise questions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. The sincerity of his commitment to not use any illegal \ndrugs in the future is unclear. The drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/31/2020 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant is a longtime marijuana user who continued to use the drug while holding a \nsecurity clearance. He was not candid about his marijuana use on security clearance \napplications completed in February 2008 and February 2018. While he now indicates that \nhe would stop using marijuana for his job, his drug use in violation of his clearance \nobligations and his lack of candor about his marijuana use continue to cast doubt about his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Clearance eligibility is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 15, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant, detailing a security concern under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR explained why the DCSA CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DSCA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for national security eligibility or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 2, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn January 29, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to \nproceed to a hearing. The case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On February 3, 2020, I scheduled a hearing for March 6, 2020. \n \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. At the Government\u2019s request, and without objection \nfrom Applicant, SOR \u00b6 2.b of the SOR was amended to correct a typographical error as to \nthe date of an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). Applicant \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on March 17, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from \napproximately 2004 to approximately September 2019, including after being granted \naccess to classified information in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that during a December 4, \n2018 interview with an authorized investigator for the Department of Defense (DOD), \nApplicant expressed his intent to continue to use marijuana, despite knowing it is illegal \nunder federal law and prohibited by his employer (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Under Guideline E, \nApplicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his February 12, 2018 e-QIP by denying \nthat he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years, and \nby denying that he had ever illegally used or been involved with a drug or controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Additionally under Guideline \nE, Applicant is alleged to have also falsified his February 15, 2008 e-QIP by denying any \nillegal drug use in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant answered the SOR before \nthe amendment to correct the date of the e-QIP in SOR \u00b6 2.b from February 15, 2018, to \nFebruary 15, 2008. He admitted the allegations without comment. (Answer.) After \nconsidering the pleading, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is 36 years old and unmarried. Shortly after graduating from high school he \ntook a three-month class in web design. He was employed outside the defense industry as \na machinist from August 2003 until February 2008, when he began working for his defense-\ncontractor employer as an assembler. (GEs 1-2.) \n \nOn February 15, 2008, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an e-QIP. He \nresponded negatively to an inquiry concerning any illegal use of a controlled substance, \nincluding marijuana, within the preceding seven years. (GE 1.)  He disclosed no issues of \npotential security concern and was granted a DOD secret clearance in approximately April \n2008. (Answer; GE 2.) \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in 2004. He passed a pre-employment drug \nscreen, and abstained from using marijuana for about seven to eight months after he was \nhired by his current employer because he knew marijuana was illegal both under federal \nand his state\u2019s laws (Tr. 43), and he should not use it. He resumed using marijuana \nrecreationally, despite holding a DOD secret clearance. (GEs 1-3.) \n  \nOn February 12, 2018, Applicant completed an e-QIP for a periodic reinvestigation \nfor his security clearance eligibility. He responded negatively to SF 86 inquiries concerning \nwhether he had illegally used any drug or controlled substance in the last seven years, and \nwhether he had ever illegally used or otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance. (GE 2.) \n \nOn December 4, 2018, Applicant was interviewed for his background reinvestigation \nby an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked \nif he had ever illegally used any drugs or controlled substances, Applicant initially \nresponded negatively before admitting that he had smoked marijuana by choice on and off \nsince the age of 18 with family and friends. He described the current frequency of his \nmarijuana use as a couple of times per week \u201cin a responsible manner\u201d because he enjoys \nit. He denied ever being impaired by marijuana while driving or working. He expressed no \nplan to cease his marijuana use, while asserting that he would be able to stop, adding that \nhe would do what he needed to do to pass a drug test, but then would resume using \nmarijuana. He had never failed a drug screen and had never had any counseling or \ntreatment for his drug use. Applicant admitted that he purchased his marijuana from a \nfriend, spending up to $100 or $200 per month on occasion. Applicant initially explained \nthat he had not disclosed his marijuana use on his security clearance application because \nhe knew that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. After the state in which he works \nbut not resides decriminalized recreational use of marijuana, his employer posted on its \nwebsite that marijuana remains illegal under federal law. When asked whether he \nintentionally concealed his drug use, Applicant responded that he would not say that. \nHowever, he later acknowledged that he did not disclose his drug involvement on his \nclearance application because of fear of losing his job and being regarded as a criminal or \nas someone who is always high. (GE 3.) \n \n \nAt DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant reviewed a copy of the summary report of his \ninterview with the OPM investigator. On September 18, 2019, Applicant attested that the \nsummary was accurate, but he also stated: \n \nRe-evaluated from previous answer. I would stop and not start again. My job \nis more important. Usage has also changed primarily too [sic] a sleep aid at \nthis point. Usage around others even less than before. Quantity consumed \ndown greatly. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn response to an interrogatory asking him to report his drug use, Applicant indicated \nthat he used marijuana between 2004 and September 5, 2019. As to its frequency, \nApplicant responded that he previously used marijuana several times a week, but \u201cstopped \non reception of this.\u201d He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future. (GE 3.) \n\n4 \n \n \nAt his March 2020 hearing, Applicant admitted that he had intentionally failed to \ndisclose his marijuana use when he completed his February 2008 e-QIP because he knew \nof several people who had passed drug screens for employment with his employer but then \nwere not hired for failure to receive a clearance because of self-reported cannabis use.  (Tr. \n17-18, 36.) Applicant also admitted that he had falsified his February 2018 e-QIP because \nhe wanted to retain his job. (Tr. 36.) Applicant expressed regret for failing to disclose his \ndrug use, adding that the possibility of him having to answer for it has been at the back of \nhis mind for the past 12 years of his employment. Applicant testified that he made a \n\u201cconscious effort to disclose\u201d his marijuana use during his December 2018 personal subject \ninterview because he never wanted to hide the information. He felt guilty about hiding it and \nwanted to \u201cremedy that and not hide something that [he] should never have hidden to begin \nwith.\u201d Applicant expressed his agreement with those states in the United States who have \nlegalized or decriminalized some form of marijuana use, and described the federal \ngovernment\u2019s prohibition as \u201ca bit wonky.\u201d Applicant acknowledged his \u201creally poor decision \nin an attempt to try and keep [his] clearance.\u201d (Tr. 17-21.) \n \n \nApplicant refrained from marijuana use for a month or two after he told DOHA in \nSeptember 2019 that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. Suffering from \ninsomnia to where his lack of sleep and exhaustion was beginning to affect his job \nperformance, Applicant resumed using marijuana as a sleep-aid. He smoked \u201cjoints\u201d or \nthrough a pipe, and purchased his marijuana from the same friend who has supplied him \nfor the last 10 to 12 years. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant tried a couple of different drugs, including \nAmbien and melatonin, four to six years ago, but cannabis relaxed his mind without the \nnegative effects he felt from other drugs. (Tr. 25-28.) Applicant used marijuana as a sleep \naid when needed, sometimes two or three times a week. (Tr. 29.) He used marijuana as a \nsleep aid as recently as March 2, 2020. (Tr. 24.) He used marijuana recreationally with his \ngirlfriend within a few weeks of March 2020. Applicant described his recreational use as \n\u201cpretty minimal at this point,\u201d and limited to his girlfriend\u2019s apartment.  He testified that he \n\u201cnever touches the stuff\u201d before work or driving a vehicle. Half of his job is spent on lifts and \nusing a crane, so he has to ensure that he can operate safely. (Tr. 31-32.) Applicant now \nmaintains that he would be willing to cease using marijuana to keep his clearance so that \nhe can retain his job. He testified it would make things difficult for him as far as his sleep \nissues, but he is willing to go back to doctors or try additional homeopathic remedies. (Tr. \n37-38.) \n \n \nApplicant likes his job and states that he has excelled at every task. (Tr. 36-37.) He \nworked his way up to the top of the labor grade in his union before recently being laid off \nfrom that position and returned to his previous job in the middle of the labor grades. (Tr. 18-\n19, 22.) His current job as an assembler requires clearance eligibility at the secret level. \n(Tr. 22.) Applicant understands that should he lose his clearance, he could possible be \ntransferred to another department where a clearance is not required. He enjoys his present \nwork and would like to stay in his department. (Tr. 23.)  \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n\n6 \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant illegally used marijuana from 2004 to at least March 2020. He continued to \npurchase and use marijuana after being granted a secret clearance and while working for a \ndefense contractor, knowing that marijuana use is illegal under federal law and his state\u2019s \nlaw, and prohibited by his employer.  During his personal subject interview in December \n2018, he expressed an intention to continue using marijuana. Four disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 25 apply. They are: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement in substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 25(c), Applicant illegally purchased his marijuana from a friend \nover the years. He has had the same supplier for the past 10 to 12 years. His purchases of \nmarijuana cannot be considered as a separate basis for disqualification because marijuana \npurchase was not alleged in the SOR. However, I cannot ignore the circumstances of his \nmarijuana use, and he was in possession of marijuana when he used it, including as \nrecently as March 2, 2020. \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nan individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n7 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility;  \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Regarding AG \u00b6 26(a), Applicant\u2019s \nrecreational use of marijuana may well have declined over the years, but he used \nmarijuana with his girlfriend as recently as a few weeks before his March 2020 hearing. He \nused marijuana as a sleep aid only four days before his hearing. Under Appendix B of the \nAGs, the grant or renewal of a security clearance is prohibited for any covered individual \nwho is an unlawful user of a controlled substance. Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana to \nwithin four days of his security clearance hearing triggers that prohibition. Although he \ntestified that he would be willing to cease his drug use, he can reasonably be considered \n\u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d as of the adjudication of his security clearance \neligibility. \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b), Applicant has established no significant period of abstinence. \nHe continues to associate with his girlfriend, who uses marijuana. As to his willingness to \nabstain from marijuana going forward if required to maintain his clearance, Applicant told \nthe DOD on September 18, 2019, that he did not intend to use any marijuana in the future. \nHe apparently abstained from marijuana for only a month or two before resuming his use of \nmarijuana, not only as a sleep aid but also recreationally with his girlfriend. Applicant has \nused marijuana for the past 15 years, and has known for 12 of those years that it could cost \nhim his job. He has had an ample opportunity to cease using marijuana, as required by his \nclearance eligibility, and failed to do so. It shows the extent to which marijuana is part of his \nlifestyle. There is a very real risk if not reasonable expectation that Applicant will continue to \nuse marijuana. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are not \nmitigated. \n \n\n8 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nApplicant admits that he falsified his initial security clearance application completed \non February 15, 2008, and on his security clearance application completed on February 12, \n2018, to update his security clearance eligibility. He deliberately did not disclose his use of \nmarijuana in February 2008 because he feared he would not obtain the security clearance \nneeded for his current employment. He concealed his drug use in February 2018 because \nhe wanted to keep his job and clearance, and because he did not want to be regarded as a \ncriminal or as someone habitually high on marijuana. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) \nand 16(e) apply. They provide: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nOne or more of the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 could apply in \nwhole or in part: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n\n9 \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do  not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant is credited with disclosing his marijuana use to the OPM investigator in \nDecember 2018, but that correction comes too late for a prompt rectification under AG \u00b6 \n17(a). Applicant was granted a secret clearance in approximately April 2008 based on \ninformation that he knew was false. He concealed his marijuana use again in February \n2018 because he knew that it was contrary to his obligations as a clearance holder \nemployed by a defense contractor and in violation of federal as well as his state\u2019s law. \nMoreover, with respect to his disclosure of his drug use during his subject interview, he \ninitially responded negatively when asked about any illegal drug involvement. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(b) was not shown to apply. Applicant chose to conceal his marijuana use \nout of self-interest and not in response to professional advice. By falsely certifying to the \naccuracy of his security clearance applications in 2008 and 2018, Applicant twice \ncommitted felonious conduct. His lack of candor on forms relied on by the government in \nconducting his background investigators is serious, repeated, and because of the 2018 \nfalsification, too recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) and AG \u00b6 17(e) warrant some consideration. Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his \ndrug involvement during his December 2018 interview and his candid testimony about his \nmarijuana use, including that he used marijuana as recently as four days before his March \n2020 hearing, show some reform under AG \u00b6 17(d). At least as to the DOD, Applicant \nmitigated vulnerability concerns under AG \u00b6 17(e). That being said, I have to evaluate \nwhether his belated disclosures are enough to mitigate his 12 years of active concealment \nof his marijuana use from the DOD and his employer. As a clearance holder, Applicant was \n\n10 \n \nobligated to report known adverse information that could potentially impact his clearance \neligibility. His belated candor is not enough to mitigate the concerns about his personal \nconduct. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nApplicant can disagree with federal drug law and policy without negative \nconsequences for his security clearance eligibility provided he does not act to violate the \nlaw or policy. By using marijuana as recently as March 2020 in knowing violation of his \nclearance, after he had told the DOD that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future,  \nApplicant casts serious doubt about whether he can be counted on to comply with the \nrequirements for handling classified information. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for past \ntransgressions. Yet it is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The \nGovernment must be able to rely on those persons granted security clearance eligibility to \nfulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and policies, and without regard \nto their personal interests. Applicant\u2019s long history of marijuana use, his failure to \ndemonstrate a commitment to abstinence in the future, and his years of concealment about \nhis drug involvement, raised enough doubt in that regard to where I am unable to conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n11 \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate finance concerns relating to his accumulated debts. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 25, 2019, Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 11, 2019, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on January 22, 2010, and interposed no objections to the materials in \nthe FORM. He did not supplement the record.  \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly is indebted to three creditors: one for child \nsupport arrears in the approximate amount of $40,000; one for a charged-off credit card \ndebt in the approximate amount of $23,851; and another for a charged-off credit card \ndebt in the approximate amount of $15,307. (Item 1) Allegedly, these delinquent debts \nremain unresolved and outstanding.  \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations of \nindebtedness with explanations. He claimed his child support arrears are owed to his \nex-wife and not the state of her residence. He claimed he took a job in March 2015 in \nanother state that pays much less (by about 40%) than his previous job, so that he be \ncloser to his family. With his reduced income, he claimed he has not been able to keep \nup with his financial obligations. Additionally, he claimed his intentions are to pay off his \ndebts \u201cno matter how long it takes.\u201d (Item 2)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old aviator for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \n \nBackground \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1996 and divorced in May 2009. (Item 3) He has three \nchildren from this marriage (ages 20, 17, and 15). He remarried in October 2012 and \nhas five stepchildren from this marriage (ages 39, 28, 18, 15, and 12). (Item 2) Applicant \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 1994. He joined the Air Force in June 1994 \nfollowing his college graduation and served 10 years of active duty and four years of \nactive reserve before receiving his honorable discharge in October 2008. (Item 8)  \n \n \nSince February 2017, Applicant has been employed as an aviator by his current \ndefense contractor. (Items 3 and 4) Between March 2015 and January 2017, he was  \nemployed by another company in the same capacity, located in a state closer to his \ncurrent state of residence. GE 1; Tr. 140) And, between March 2008 and March 2015, \nhe was employed by other employers as an aviator in other states much farther away \nfrom his current state of employment and residence. (Items 3-4)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \n \nIn March 2015, Applicant took a lower paying aviator\u2019s position in a state much \ncloser to his current state of residence to be nearer to his wife and children. (Items 1-4) \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nWith this lower paying position, he encountered difficulties keeping up with his child \nsupport and consumer obligations and fell behind in his payment responsibilities. (Items \n1-4)  \n \nIn an effort to address his child support arrears (in excess of $40,000), Applicant \napplied in 2015 to his state\u2019s child services agency for an adjustment to his ordered \nchild support payments. (Items 2-4) While waiting for a child support reduction decision \nfrom the enforcing state agency, he ceased making payments on his child support \nobligations altogether. Credit reports confirm that he has been delinquent with two credit \ncard accounts listed in the SOR, \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($23,851) and 1.c ($15,307), since April 2016 \nand November 2017, respectively. Both credit card accounts have since been charged \noff. \n \nUntil Applicant finds a higher paying job, he is not financially positioned to \naddress either his child support arrears or his charged-off credit card delinquencies. \n(Items 2-4) While he remains committed to addressing these debts when he finds a \nbetter paying job, he has provided no updates on his job searches. He provided no \nevidence of financial counseling or budgeting. \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligation may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator \nof, other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive \ngambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse \nor dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n \nBurdens of Proof \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1.  \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of child support \narears and two charged-off credit card debts. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties \nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial \nconsideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Both of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted child support arrears and delinquent credit card debts \nnegate the need for any independent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; \nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006) each of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts is fully \ndocumented and creates some judgment issues. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies. \n \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (app. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \ncited circumstances (reduced income from the lower paying job he accepted to be \ncloser to his family) provide some extenuating benefit. While mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 \n20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019s debt situation, it is not \nenough by itself to satisfy minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance. \n \n \nBecause Applicant has failed to undertake any affirmative steps to address his \nchild support arrears and charged-off credit card debts in the years since they became \ndelinquent, or provide more detailed and convincing explanations of why he has not \nbeen able to address them, mitigating credit cannot be extended to him under any of the \npotentially available mitigating conditions. MC \u00b6 20(b) has only very limited availability in \nlight of his documented failure to initiate any efforts (modest or otherwise) to address his \ndelinquent obligations with the income available to him from his lower paying aviator \nassignments. \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \ndelinquent debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) In \nApplicant\u2019s case, he has failed to take any steps to address his child support arrears \nand two charged-off credit cards. His failure to initiate even minimum payment efforts \nwith the resources available to him preclude favorable findings and conclusions with \nrespect to raised security concerns over the state of his finances. \n \nWhole-person assessment \n \n \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with the minimum standards  \nfor holding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to considerable credit for his military \ncontributions to the Air Force and continued service as a civil aviator, his efforts are not \nenough at this time to overcome his inability to maintain his finances in a sufficiently \nstable manner to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nGuideline E (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n        Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: William H. Henderson, Personal Representative \n05/26/2020 \nDecision \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 4, 2017. \nOn October 4, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 26, 2019, and initially requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On January 23, 2020, he withdrew his request \nfor a hearing and requested a decision on the written record without a hearing. On \nJanuary 31, 2020, the Government sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a \nfile of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. \nHe was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, \n\n \n2 \n \nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on February 2, 2020, and timely submitted his response, to which \nthe Government did not object. Applicant did not object to Items 1 through 4. Items 1 \nand 2 are the pleadings in the case. Items 3 and 4 are admitted into evidence. Applicant \nobjected to Items 5 and 6, which are the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice requests \nconcerning Taiwan and China. Given the nature of the documents, Items 5 and 6 are \nappended to the record as hearing exhibits (HE I and II, respectively) rather than as \nevidentiary exhibits. Applicant\u2019s objections are addressed in the Procedural Matters \nsection, below. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents that are marked and admitted into \nevidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H. Applicant\u2019s FORM response included \ndocuments containing his objections to the Government\u2019s Administrative Notice \nrequests and an Administrative Notice request about Taiwan that are appended to the \nrecord as HE III through V. His response also contained another Administrative Notice \nrequest that is marked and admitted into evidence as AE I. AE I and Item 4 are further \ndiscussed in the Procedural Matters section, below. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 11, 2020. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nItem 4 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 4. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise any objection to Item 4 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat Item 4 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not raise an \nobjection to Item 4 in his FORM response or otherwise. \n \nApplicant objected to my taking administrative notice of the U.S. Government\u2019s \npronouncements concerning Taiwan and China, as outlined in HE I and HE II. The \nobjection is overruled. These pronouncements are relevant to Applicant\u2019s specific \ncircumstances. They reflect the official position of the U.S. government, derived from \nofficial U.S. government publications, and therefore, are factual and relevant within the \ncontext of the security clearance determination. Paragraph 6 of Guideline B of the AG \nrequires consideration of the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact \nor financial interest is located. HE I and HE II contain facts that reflect the U.S. \nGovernment\u2019s official positions regarding the internal and external affairs of foreign \ncountries, as well as their international relations with the U.S. and other countries, which \nare essential to the analysis in Guideline B cases.  \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the facts about Taiwan and China that are \ncontained in HE I, II, and V. Those facts are not repeated verbatim, but are summarized \nin the Administrative Notice section, below. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nI, sua sponte, declined to take administrative notice of the facts contained in AE I \nbecause I am unable to conclude that they are the official positions of the U.S. \nGovernment. AE I is a technical report analyzing the data of a DOD agency, which was \nauthored by a private-sector individual on behalf of a defense contractor and distributed \nby that agency. There is no indication either within the report or proffered by Applicant \nthat the agency adopted the analysis and conclusions of the author. Nevertheless, \nbecause AE I was proffered by Applicant without objection by the Government, I have \nconsidered it as a learned treatise. Because this sua sponte action did not affect either \nthe relative positions of the parties or my decision, prior notice to the parties was not \nrequired. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted each of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. Applicant, age 51, has been married since 1997. He has two \nchildren, ages 16 and 20. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree (in 1991) and master\u2019s degree \n(in 1993) in Taiwan. He earned a second master\u2019s degree (in 2000) in the United \nStates. He has been employed as a software engineer by two employers since he \narrived in the United States \u2013 the first from 1999 through 2016; and the second, a \ndefense contractor, since 2016. This is his first application for a security clearance. \n(Items 1, 3) \n \nApplicant and his wife are Taiwanese citizens by birth. Applicant entered the \nUnited States in 1997. His first U.S. employer sponsored his green card. At their first \nopportunity, he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2010. Their children are \nU.S. citizens by birth. His wife earned her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in the United \nStates. She works for a U.S. private-sector employer. (Items 1, 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His mother, \nage 75, is a homemaker. His father, age 86, retired from the Taiwanese Navy in 1986 \nas instructor at the military service school. Applicant visits his parents in Taiwan once \nper year. He communicates with his father by phone once per month, and with his \nmother by phone once every week. (Items 1, 3, 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Brother 1, age 49, \nretired from the Taiwanese Army in 2012 as an aircraft mechanic. From 2013 through \n2016, he attended and then graduated from a theological seminary. He has been \nemployed as a pastor by a community church since 2017. Brother 1 is married with two \nschool-aged children. Brother 1\u2019s spouse is a homemaker and part-time piano teacher. \nApplicant visits Brother 1 in Taiwan once per year, and communicates with him by \nphone or email two times per year. (Items 1, 3, 4) \n \nBrother 2, age 47, is employed as an engineer by a private-sector electronics \ncompany. His company, an original design manufacturer with 64,000 employers, \nproduces computers, computer-related equipment, and televisions for a variety of \nclients around the world. Brother 2 is married with two school-aged children. Brother 2\u2019s \nspouse is a homemaker and an elementary-school substitute teacher. Applicant visits \n\n \n4 \n \nBrother 2 in Taiwan once per year, and communicates with him by phone or email once \nevery two to three months. (Items 1, 3, 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law (MIL), age 73, is a homemaker. He visits her in Taiwan \nonce every one to two years. He communicates with her by phone once every three \nmonths. His father-in-law is deceased. (Items 1, 3, 4) \n \nApplicant has traveled to Taiwan every year since 1997, except for 2002 and \n2009, to visit the family members described above. During his trips to Taiwan, Applicant \nis accompanied by his wife and children and they stay with Applicant\u2019s parents. They \nhave never experienced any security-significant issues while in Taiwan. (Item 1 at 12; \nItem 3 at 10-12, 39-50; Item 4 at 2, 4) \n \nApplicant has owned his home in the United States since 2002. His wife \nmaintains a bank account with a balance of $600 or less in Taiwan that is only used for \nconvenience during trips to Taiwan. His wife co-owns, with her mother and brother,1 two \nproperties in Taiwan that they inherited from his wife\u2019s father. His wife\u2019s one-third \ninterest in those properties totals $33,000. The value of his wife\u2019s bank account and \nproperty interests in Taiwan represent less than 2.5 percent of their family\u2019s overall net \nworth and is not important to their overall financial situation. The value of the assets \nthey own in the United States totals approximately 1.4 million dollars, including their \nhome (the mortgage on which has been paid off), education and retirement savings, \npersonal property, and regular savings. (Item 1 at 11; Item 3 at 33-37; Item 4 at 5)  \n \nAlthough Applicant has never had access to classified information, both of his \nU.S. employers have entrusted him with sensitive proprietary information. He received \ntrainings on information, personnel, and physical security procedures from his first U.S. \nemployer. As a defense contractor, he has received basic security indoctrination training \nand annual online training regarding the safeguarding of sensitive material, protection of \npersonal information on social media, export controls, and handling/reporting of \nsuspicious contacts. He is \u201cvery security conscious at work\u201d and has \u201cnever been \ninvolved in a security violation.\u201d If he is ever approached by anyone and asked to \nprovide information concerning his work, classified or not, to any foreign country or \nentity, he will decline immediately and notify the FBI. He will immediately report any \nsuspicious contact, including those with Taiwanese nationals, to his employer\u2019s security \nrepresentative. He keeps the contact information for the FBI and his employer\u2019s security \noffice in his mobile phone so that he will have it with him at all times. To-date, he has \nnever been involved in any conduct or situation that needed to be reported. (Item 1 at \n12) \n \nApplicant and his wife chose to remain and raise their children in the United \nStates because they \u201crecognized and agreed with the freedom, quality, politics, and \nmany other aspects of life in the [United States].\u201d They value the \u201ccareer opportunities, \nwork environment, education system, and healthy living environment available [in the \nUnited States].\u201d Applicant\u2019s experience living in and visiting Taiwan has made him more \n                                                          \n1 There are no other facts about Applicant\u2019s brother in the record. It is unknown in which country he \nresides or of which country he is a citizen. \n\n \n5 \n \nappreciative of the rights, privileges, freedoms, and way of life that he and his family \nenjoy in the United States. The United States has been his home for 22 years, which is \nmost of his adult life, and is the only country to which Applicant feels loyalty, allegiance, \nand attachment. (Item 11, 13) \n \n \nWith respect to the potential conflict of interest his Taiwanese family poses, \nApplicant stated: \n \nI would never do anything for the benefit of another country that might \nwork to the disadvantage of the [United States]. I would never do anything \nthat might be detrimental to the national security interests of the [United \nStates]. I am willing to support the defense of the United States against \nother country[sic], including Taiwan should the relationship between the \n[United States] become adversarial. . . .  \n \nI feel familial affection and obligation to my relatives in Taiwan, but my \ndesire and obligation to maintain the security of the United States \nsupersedes my obligation to my relatives in Taiwan. I can say without \nequivocation that I feel no divided loyalty or allegiance between the United \nStates and Taiwan. The only country to which I feel national allegiance \nand loyal[sic] is the United States of America. . . . I could never be \ninfluenced to do anything detrimental to the interests of the [United \nStates], even under threat of harm to my relatives in Taiwan. If I were ever \nasked to choose between the security interests of the United States and \nthe safety, security, and wellbeing of my relatives in Taiwan, I would chose \nthe security interest of the United States without hesitation. . . . (Item 1 at \n9, 12) \n \n \nFriends and colleagues who know Applicant well commended his character, \njudgment, and work ethic. They also praised his patriotism and loyalty towards the \nUnited States. Applicant is active in his church and community. His supervisors lauded \nhis work performance. (AE A through H)  \n \nAdministrative Notice  \n \nThe United States recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China \nas the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is \nbut one China and Taiwan is part of China. In 2019, China made clear its increasingly \nuncompromising stance towards Taiwan\u2019s independent status and sense of urgency \nregarding unification.  \n \nThe United States does not support Taiwan independence. However, the United \nStates and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act \nprovides the legal basis for this relationship and enshrines the United States\u2019 \ncommitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability. In 2019, the United \nStates took significant steps to demonstrate support for and expand cooperation with \nTaiwan in the areas of defense and security. \n\n \n6 \n \nChina poses a serious threat to the national security of the United States. It \nremains the most active strategic competitor responsible for cyber espionage against \nthe U.S. Government. China\u2019s pursuit of intellectual property, sensitive research and \ndevelopment plans, and U.S. person data remains a significant threat to the U.S. \nGovernment. Taiwan has been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that \nhave sensitive military applications. Numerous cases have arisen involving the illegal \nexport or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n7 \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe following are potentially relevant disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(d): counterintelligence information, whether classified or \nunclassified, that indicates the individual's access to classified information \n\n \n8 \n \nor eligibility for a sensitive position may involve unacceptable risk to \nnational security; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct ties to his mother, father, two brothers, and mother-in-law \nestablish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) based on the heightened risk associated with Taiwan and \nthe potential conflict of interest that arises from his connection to them. His indirect tie to \nhis mother-in-law through his wife establishes AG \u00b6 7(e). Applicant\u2019s father and \nbrothers\u2019 employment in the Taiwanese military and technology sector establishes AG \u00b6 \n7(d). A heightened risk is associated with Taiwan due to China\u2019s espionage against the \nUnited States and its own active collection of U.S. economic technologies that have \nsensitive military applications. Applicant bears the burden of persuasion to mitigate \nthese concerns. (ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000)  \n \nApplication of the AG is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely \nan acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices \nthat could be important to a loved one, such as a family member. (ISCR Case No. 08-\n10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Family relationships can involve matters of \ninfluence or obligation. (ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003). As a matter \nof common sense and human experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a \nperson has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the \nperson\u2019s spouse. (ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s marital relationship provides a conduit for susceptibility to foreign influence \nbecause of the vulnerabilities associated with his in-laws that may pass to him through \nhis wife. (ISCR Case No. 03-24144 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005)  \n \nThe following mitigating condition under this guideline is established: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. \n \nApplicant has resided in the United States for 23 years and chosen it as his \npermanent home. Since he immigrated, Applicant pursued his second postgraduate \ndegree from a U.S. university and has had a successful career working for U.S. \ncompanies, including a defense contractor. At their first opportunity, Applicant and his \nwife became naturalized U.S. citizens. Their children are U.S. citizens by birth. All of \ntheir significant assets are in the United States, including their home, which they have \nowned for over 17 years and is mortgage-free. \n \n\n \n9 \n \nApplicant maintains strong familial ties to a country associated with a heightened \nrisk. While the positions previously held by his father and brother have no lingering \nsecurity significance, his brother\u2019s employment in the technology sector remains a \nconcern. Despite these compelling familial ties to Taiwan, his much deeper ties are in \nthe United States. Applicant and his wife\u2019s significant financial interests, plans for their \nfuture, and loyalties are longstanding and firmly rooted in the United States. Therefore, I \nconclude that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. Accordingly, Applicant has met his heavy burden to mitigate the Government\u2019s \nGuideline B concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nAG, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. In evaluating \nthe relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). I weighed the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluated all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person and the heightened risk associated with Taiwan. Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his ties to citizens and residents of Taiwan. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR failed to \n\n2 \naddress all of the allegations, and a letter was sent on January 6, 2020, instructing him \nto do so. He received the letter on January 26, 2020, and subsequently filed another \nanswer in which he answered all of the allegations except \u00b6 2.a, which he again failed to \naddress. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM), and Applicant received it on March 3, 2020. He was afforded an opportunity to \nfile objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days \nof receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, \nor submit documents. Items 1 through 5 are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on May 12, 2020.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, except the allegation in \u00b6 2.a, which \nhe failed to answer. His failure to answer will be considered to be a denial. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. He served in the military from 1986 to 1990 and was \nhonorably discharged. He has a grown child from a previous relationship. He married in \n2003 and has 16-year-old child and 20-year-old stepchild.  \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to periods of unemployment, which he \ndisclosed in his security clearance application (SCA) were from January 2016 to June \n2016; January 2015 to May 2015; and February 2014 to June 2014. He was employed \nby a government contactor from 2007 to January 2014. He also attributed it to his wife\u2019s \nloss of job due to medical issues. She reentered the workforce four months later, but her \nmedical issues recurred and she was again unable to work. Applicant did not provide the \nspecific dates when his wife lost her job, but said she was out of work a couple of years \nago for two years. It is unknown whether she is currently working. (Item 2) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are substantiated by Applicant\u2019s admissions and \ncredit reports from June 2018 and January 2019. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($24,145) is a vehicle repossession. The account was \nopened in January 2015 and the last activity on it was November 2017. Applicant wrote \non the SOR: \u201cI admit. I owe the money. But I turned the car in voluntarily.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s \nnarrative answer to the SOR, he stated: \u201c[w]e tried to keep the [car] but with only one \nperson working I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d (Item 2) Applicant did not provide documentary \nevidence to substantiate he has paid, made arrangements to pay, or otherwise resolved \nthis delinquent debt. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($7,217) and 1.g ($277) are charged off accounts \nfrom the same creditor. Applicant avers that he is making payments on both. He provided \na letter from November 2019 indicating an agreement to pay $50 in the next week. \nApplicant did not provide documentary evidence that he made the agreed upon $50 \n\n3 \npayment or that he has made other payments on the agreement and it is resolved. (Items \n2, 4, 5) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,813) is a telecommunications debt that Applicant admits \nand stated he is on a payment plan. The debt resulted when he switched cell phone plans. \nHe has not provided documentary evidence to show he has paid, made arrangements to \npay, or otherwise resolved this debt. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nApplicant indicated he was on a payment plan with the creditor for the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d ($909). He provided a November 2019 letter from the collection agency that holds \nthe account reflecting a settlement agreement with Applicant to make a payment of $25 \nin November 2019 and December 2019, and a final payment of $632 in January 2020. \nApplicant did not provide documentary evidence to show he made any of the three agreed \nupon payments, or that he has otherwise resolved the debt. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nApplicant provided proof that in November 2019, he paid the delinquent medical \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($137). Applicant admits he is responsible for the telecommunications \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($833). He provided a letter from the collection agency holding the \naccount that reflects it agreed to settle the account with payments of $25 in November \nand December 2019, and a final payment of $366 in January 2020. Applicant did not \nprovide documentary evidence to show he made the agreed upon payments or has \notherwise resolved the debt. (Items 2, 4, 5) \nApplicant completed a SCA in April 2018. Section 26 asked if in the past seven \nyears he had any property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed; bills or debts turned \nover to a collection agency; any accounts charged off; or if he was currently over 120 \ndays delinquent on any debt. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all of those inquiries and failed \nto disclose his repossessed vehicle, charged off debts, and debts in collection as alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a though 1.d and 1.g. When responding to the SOR, Applicant wrote next to \n\u00b6 1.a that he voluntarily turned in the vehicle. He stated in his answer that he attempted \nto keep up with the vehicle payments, but was unable to because he was the only one \nworking. The last activity on this account was November 2017. Applicant was aware his \nvehicle was repossessed and he was past due on payments when he submitted his SCA. \nHe deliberately failed to disclose this information on it. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n4 \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n5 \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant has delinquent debts totaling approximately $35,194 that have not been \npaid or resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; and\n\n6 \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant admitted he owed all of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He \nprovided documentary proof that he paid the small medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e after he \nreceived the SOR. He stated he had settlement agreements on some debts, but failed to \nprovide documentary evidence to substantiate any payments made toward the debts or \nother evidence of efforts to resolve these debts. I am unable to conclude that financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubts on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s loss of job due to medical \nissues. A specific time line was not provided. Applicant also attributed his financial \nproblems to his periods of unemployment. These were conditions beyond his control. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant failed to provide documentary evidence \nto substantiate any payments he made to settle or resolve the debts alleged. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas limited application. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.e. There is no evidence he has \nreceived financial counseling or that his debts are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply.  \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR confirms he was aware his vehicle had been \nrepossessed, and he was having difficulty meeting his financial obligations, at the time he \nsubmitted his SCA. He deliberately failed to disclose these issues on his SCA as was \nrequired. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies.  \n\n7 \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 17(a). There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that Applicant made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his \nomissions. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because deliberately failing to disclose information on \na SCA and swearing to its accuracy is not a minor offense. I find Applicant\u2019s omissions \nare serious and cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n8 \nApplicant is 54 years old. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph  2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n_____________________________ \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s request for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 12, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of a \nsubsequent background investigation, adjudicators at the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine that it was clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified \ninformation, as required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive \n5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn October 28, 2019, the DOD CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR \nwere issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective \nfor all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) \nand requested a decision without a hearing. \nOn April 24, 2020, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contained six documents (Items \n1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relied to establish the facts alleged in the SOR. The \nGovernment also included documents from the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \n(Item 7), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (Item 8), and the Department of \nJustice (Item 9) that present policy guidance germane to issues in this case. Items 7 \u2013 9 \nare not evidence pertaining to issues of fact in this case and I have not considered them \nfor that purpose; however, I have taken administrative notice of the information and policy \nguidance presented therein. \nApplicant received the FORM on May 18, 2020. He was informed therein that he \nhad 30 days from the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the \nFORM and to submit additional information in response to the FORM. Applicant did not \nsubmit any additional information or file any objections to the use of any of the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits within the time allotted. The record closed on June 17, 2020, and \nI received this case for decision on July 21, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged that between October 2017 and at least April 2019, Applicant \nused CBD with varying frequency (SOR 1.a); that he purchased and used marijuana in \nOctober 2017 (SOR 1.b); and that he illegally purchased and used both substances while \nholding a security clearance (SOR 1.c). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all \nthree SOR allegations. He also stated that he chose to use CBD and marijuana as natural \nalternatives to chemical medications prescribed by his doctors. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has \nworked as a technical support specialist since October 2008. He served on active duty in \nthe United States Air Force from May 2005 until he was honorably discharged for medical \nreasons in November 2007. Applicant first received a security clearance when he entered \non active duty in the Air Force. Since October 2011, he has held an industrial security \nclearance as part of his current defense contractor employment, and he is now applying \nto renew his clearance eligibility. (FORM, Items 3 and 5) \nApplicant was born and raised in State A. After leaving the military, he returned to \nlive and work there in July 2008. He has been married since April 2018. A previous \nmarriage began in April 2011 and ended by divorce in February 2018. While he and his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \nex-wife were separated and going through his divorce in 2017, Applicant lived with a \ngirlfriend in State A, where marijuana is illegal, but CBD containing less than 0.3 percent \ntetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the federally-controlled substance in marijuana, is legal. On \nOctober 13, 2017, police responded to a domestic disturbance at Applicant\u2019s house \ninvolving his girlfriend and his estranged wife. During that incident, police found a small \namount of marijuana. Applicant was not present when the police arrived, but when he \narrived at the house, Applicant told police the marijuana was his. He subsequently \ndisclosed this incident to his facility security officer (FSO) at work and stated the drugs \nactually belonged to his girlfriend, but that he had lied to the police so his girlfriend would \nnot get in trouble. (FORM, Items 3 \u2013 6) \nApplicant started using marijuana and CBD to relieve stress from his divorce and \nto help him deal with seizures he experienced after suffering a stroke in June 2017. He \nbelieves the stroke was brought on by the stress of work and his pending divorce. \nApplicant started using marijuana while visiting his brother in State B, where marijuana \nand CBD use are legal. He purchased the marijuana and CBD at a dispensary licensed \nby State B. As part of his background investigation, Applicant was interviewed in April \n2019 by a government investigator. In discussing the October 2017 domestic incident and \nhis use of marijuana, Applicant stated that he would continue to use CBD in State A, \nwhere it is legal as long as it contains less than 0.3 percent THC, the active ingredient in \nmarijuana that makes marijuana a controlled substance. Applicant further stated his intent \nto resume using marijuana in State A if that state makes it legal. (FORM, Items 3 \u2013 6) \nI take administrative notice of the information presented by the Government in \nItems 7 \u2013 9 to find that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, the use and \npossession of which is a criminal violation of federal law. Those exhibits, along with \nguidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in February \n2013, make clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this issue, \nApplicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana, regardless of location, is illegal. Further, \nillegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces and on all military installations by \ncivilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nBecause the Government did not specifically address in the FORM the allegation \nof CBD use, I note sua sponte that CBD is not uniformly regulated in the United States \nand many CBD products contain more than 0.3 percent THC. Accordingly, just as with \nmarijuana, use of CBD is prohibited throughout the federal workplace and in the military. \nThe only exceptions to this ban are for rare instances involving medical prescriptions. In \nhis April 2019 interview, Applicant stated that he does not use products containing THC; \nhowever, in response to the SOR and the FORM, he has not produced any information \nto show what he has been using does not contain THC, or that establishes he has a \nmedical exemption from the DOD ban on CBD use. (FORM, Item 4) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant illegally purchased and used marijuana in October 2017. Between then \nand at least April 2019, he also has used CBD in contravention of federal prohibitions \nagainst its use. He purchased and used these substances while he held a security \n4 \n\nclearance. This information reasonably raises a security concern that is stated at AG \u00b6 \n24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \nI also have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: . . . \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant to present \ninformation that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. In response to \nthe SOR and the FORM, Applicant did not present information that would support any of \nthese mitigating conditions. His use of marijuana occurred almost three years ago, but he \nhas continued to use CBD despite federal workplace prohibitions against it. As to whether \nit occurred under unusual circumstances and is unlikely to recur, he claimed that he uses \nthese substances to deal with a medical condition. Applicant did not establish that he is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nentitled to any medical exemption that would allow him to use CBD. Instead, available \ninformation shows Applicant is using illegal substances as a means of self-medication \nwhen proven, legal methods are readily available to him. If he was not satisfied with those \nlegal methods, he could have engaged legitimate medical professionals to come up with \nan acceptable regimen for dealing with whatever medical issues Applicant has. Finally, \nApplicant stated his intent to continue using CBD and, if legalized in the state where he \nlives and works, to resume using marijuana. \nAlthough potentially legal under certain state laws, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and \nCBD are still impermissible under federal controlled substances laws as well as DOD \nindustrial security policy guidance. On balance, Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns established by the Government\u2019s information. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). I note that Applicant served in the \nAir Force and that there is no other indication of misconduct presented in this record. \nNonetheless, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana and CBD while holding a security clearance, \nand despite government policies against such conduct, now raises doubts about his \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations regarding the \nprotection of sensitive information. Because the protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal goal of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without any comments, nearly all of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.e.) and drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). He failed to address the remaining allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a driver with his current employer since October 2018. He previously served as a delivery driver with another company from October 2016 until October 2018, and as a warehouse inventory control with a different company from May 2007 until May 2016. He is a 1973 high school graduate. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance. Applicant was married in 1991. He has no biological children. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Applicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was marijuana. He used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about January 1975 until at least September 2018, for a period of over four decades. He reported that he generally used marijuana while alone or when he was at the beach with others who were partying and having a good time. (Item 4 \u2013 Subject Contact, dated May 30, 2",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n01/10/2020\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 17, 2019, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On October 4, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and H \n(Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), and detailed reasons why the DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a notarized statement, dated October 18, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 31, 2019, and he was \nafforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days, to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished \na copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. \nApplicant received the FORM on November 7, 2019. His response was due on December \n7, 2019. Applicant did not submit any response to the FORM. The case was assigned to \nme on January 3, 2020.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without any comments, nearly all of \nthe factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.e.) and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). He failed to address the \nremaining allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).  Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and \nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a driver with his current employer since October 2018. He previously served as a \ndelivery driver with another company from October 2016 until October 2018, and as a \nwarehouse inventory control with a different company from May 2007 until May 2016. He \nis a 1973 high school graduate. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never \nbeen granted a security clearance. Applicant was married in 1991. He has no biological \nchildren. \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nApplicant was a recreational substance abuser whose substance of choice was \nmarijuana. He used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about January 1975 until at \nleast September 2018, for a period of over four decades. He reported that he generally \nused marijuana while alone or when he was at the beach with others who were partying \nand having a good time. (Item 4 \u2013 Subject Contact, dated May 30, 2019, at 12)  In May \n2016, after being involved in a vehicle incident in which the unsecured battery of his \ncompany vehicle fell out of the vehicle as it turned a corner, his on-site supervisor, in \ncompliance with company procedures after a vehicle incident, directed that Applicant be \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ntaken to a medical facility where he was administered a urine test. Applicant was \nsuspended for one week pending the test results. Applicant\u2019s test results were positive \nfor marijuana. In compliance with the employer\u2019s zero-tolerance drug policy, Applicant \nwas immediately terminated from his employment. (Item 4 \u2013 Subject Contact, dated May \n23, 2019, at 10; Item 4 \u2013 Subject Contact, dated May 30, 2019, at 11-12)  \n \nWhile Applicant received treatment and counseling for alcohol abuse in 2001, he \nhas never received treatment or counseling as a result of his illegal use of drugs or \ncontrolled substances. (Item 4 \u2013 Enhanced Subject Interview, dated March 6, 2019, at 7) \nAlthough his termination took place in May 2016, Applicant admitted that he continued \nusing marijuana for two and a quarter more years. He acknowledged that his wrongful \nmarijuana use caused issues at home with his wife. (Item 4 \u2013Subject Contact, dated May \n30, 2019, at 12) He claims that he no longer uses drugs and that he stopped doing so in \nSeptember 2018. He also claimed that he no longer socializes or works with people who \nare involved in criminal activity. (Item 4 \u2013 Enhanced Subject Interview, dated March 30, \n2019, at 7; Item 4 \u2013 Subject Contact, dated May 30, 2019, at 12) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant has a history of a lack of candor. On January 17, 2019, when Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86, he responded to certain questions pertaining to his employment \nrecord found in Sections 13A \u2013 Employment Activities; 13B \u2013 Employment Record; and \nhis illegal use of drugs or drug activity found in Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity. The most significant questions, and the ones alleged in the SOR, were essentially \nas follows:  \n \n(Section 13A): Applicant was asked if he had left a particular employment by \nmutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance, and he said \u201cyes,\u201d that \nhe had left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. He \nclaimed the reason for the unsatisfactory performance was personal. Those responses \nwere false, for Applicant had been terminated for a positive urinalysis and violation of the \nemployer\u2019s zero tolerance drug policy, not for unsatisfactory performance. (Item 3, at 13-\n14) \n \n(Section 13C): Applicant was asked if, in the last seven years, he had been fired \nfrom a job; quit a job after being told he would be fired; left a job by mutual agreement \nfollowing charges or allegations of misconduct; left a job by mutual agreement following \nnotice of unsatisfactory performance; or received a written warning, been officially \nreprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as violation \nof a security policy. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions. His response was false, for \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose that he had been terminated from employment for \na positive urinalysis and violation of the employer\u2019s zero-tolerance drug policy. (Item 3, at \n14-15) \n \n(Section 23): Applicant was asked if, in the last seven (7) years, he had illegally \nused any drugs or controlled substances. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question. (Item \n3, at 30) He omitted and concealed his subsequently admitted use of marijuana.  \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nApplicant certified that his responses to those three sets of questions were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief. In fact, because of his \nomissions and concealments, the responses to those questions were, in fact, false.  \n \n \nOn March 6, 2019, Applicant underwent an interview with an investigator from the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). In response to an inquiry regarding any \ninvolvement with illegal drugs in the last seven years, Applicant falsely responded \u201cno,\u201d \nand deflected the inquiry to alcohol issues. (Item 4 \u2013 Enhanced Subject Interview, dated \nMarch 6, 2019, at 6-7) On May 23, 2019, Applicant acknowledged that he had been \nterminated because of his failed drug test. On May 30, 2019, Applicant was confronted \nwith his false response on his SF 86 with respect to his illegal substance use. He \nexplained that he had said \u201cno\u201d because he feared a true answer (\u201cyes\u201d) would be \ndetrimental to his employment. (Item 4 \u2013 Subject Contact, dated May 30, 2019, at 12)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).) \n \n The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7)  Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24:       \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \n \nThe guideline notes a condition under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security concerns \nin this case:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \n \nApplicant was admittedly a recreational substance abuser. He used marijuana, a \ncontrolled substance, with varying frequency, for a period of over four decades, reportedly \nending as recently as September 2018. He claimed that he generally used marijuana \nwhile alone or when he was at the beach with others who were partying and having a \ngood time. AG \u00b6 25(a) has been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies, but no other condition applies. Applicant used \nmarijuana for a period of over four decades, reportedly ending as recently as September \n2018. As such, there was nothing infrequent about his marijuana use, and there is no \nevidence to indicate that it happened under such circumstances that it was unlikely to \nrecur. In fact, even after he was terminated for violation of his employer\u2019s zero tolerance \ndrug policy following a positive urinalysis for marijuana, Applicant continued using \nmarijuana for two and a quarter more years. He acknowledged that his wrongful use of \nmarijuana caused issues at home with his wife. While Applicant now acknowledges his \npast drug involvement and substance misuse, he has only stated that he is abstinent \nsince September 2018. There is no documentation that might support his position. Also, \nalthough he claims to have no intention of future drug involvement and substance misuse, \nhe has not submitted a formal statement acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, but \nin this instance, after over four decades of marijuana use, the most recent drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, was in September 2018.  Continued abstinence is to \nbe encouraged, but the relatively brief period of such abstinence is in stark contrast to the \nlengthy decades-old period of marijuana use, and is considered insufficient to conclude \nthat the abstinence will continue. Given Applicant\u2019s cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, \nand regulations, his use of marijuana, despite knowing that such use was prohibited by \nboth the Government and his employer, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \n \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. At the time Applicant completed his SF 86 in January 2019, he \nintentionally concealed any references to his history of drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. When he was subsequently interviewed by an OPM investigator, he again denied \nany such involvement and deflected the inquiry to alcohol issues. It was only after he was \nconfronted with the developed facts regarding his employment termination and positive \nurinalysis that he opened up about the truth of his lengthy history of marijuana use. \nApplicant explained that he had denied and concealed any drug references, or \nemployment issues with respect to his marijuana use because he feared a true answers \nwould be detrimental to his employment. Furthermore, since he had already been \nterminated in 2016, it would appear to be a reasonable conclusion that he continued to \ndeny his decades of marijuana use because it might have negative impact of his security \nclearance eligibility.  \n \nI have considered the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions of the SOR \nallegations. Applicant did not controvert the falsification allegations. In other words, he \nintentionally concealed his substance misuse and falsified his responses. As to the \ndeliberate falsifications on the 2019 SF 86 and his OPM interviews regarding his drug \nactivity, and his employment issues arising from those activities, pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b. through 1.e., AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(c) have been established. With respect to \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana and his termination from employment, pertaining to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a., 2.a., and 2.b., AG \u00b6 16(e) has been established.  \n \n\n9 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nNeither of the conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s false responses to the SF 86 inquiry \noccurred in January 2019, and he finally told the truth to the OPM investigator in May \n2019, after a series of interviews. Before his May 30, 2019 interview, he made no efforts \nto correct the omissions, concealments, or falsifications associated with his SF 86 or his \nearlier interviews. Applicant\u2019s refusal to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, as well \nas with employment rules and policies, lasted over four decades. Despite his claimed new \ncompliance with all of the above, Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006))  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 64-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a driver with his current \nemployer since October 2018. He previously served as a delivery driver with another \ncompany from October 2016 until October 2018, and as a warehouse inventory control \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nwith a different company from May 2007 until May 2016. He is a 1973 high school \ngraduate. He finally confessed to the OPM investigator in May 2019 that he had previously \nused marijuana; the impact on him about using it; that he has not used marijuana since \nSeptember 2018; and that he no longer intends to use it in the future. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from about January 1975 until at least \nSeptember 2018, for a period of over four decades. He generally used marijuana while \nalone or when he was at the beach with others who were partying and having a good \ntime. After a vehicle incident in 2016, he was directed to undergo a urinalysis. The test \nresults were positive for marijuana. In compliance with the employer\u2019s zero-tolerance drug \npolicy, Applicant was immediately terminated from his employment. Nevertheless, he \ncontinued to use marijuana until at least September 2018. When he completed his SF 86 \nin January 2019, and was interviewed by an OPM investigator several times thereafter, \nApplicant repeatedly falsely denied any negative employment issues or drug issues. It \nwas only after he was confronted by the OPM investigator in May 2019 with known facts \nthat Applicant finally confessed. Applicant has never received treatment and counseling \nas a result of his illegal use of drugs or controlled substances. He acknowledged that his \nwrongful marijuana use caused issues at home with his wife.  \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse; and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He used an Iraqi identification card to obtain a job in Iraq. He is in \nextended leave from that job, and has the ability to return to that job at any time. \nForeign influence and foreign preference security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 13, \n2017, seeking clearance eligibility for a position as a linguist with a federal contractor. \nAfter reviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 13, \n2019, alleging security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline C \n(foreign preference). Applicant answered the SOR on December 27, 2019, and \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nFebruary 28, 2020. Applicant received the FORM on March 5, 2020. He was granted a \nperiod of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the FORM and \n\n \n2 \n \n \nto provide material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the concerns. Applicant did not \nrespond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on May 12, 2020. Applicant raised \nno objections to the Government\u2019s proffered evidence. I admitted and considered the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed evidence.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts \nconcerning the Federal Republic of Iraq, its internal and external affairs, and its relations \nwith the United States, to determine whether foreign influence security concerns are \nraised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. (FORM) Applicant did not object to me taking \nadministrative notice of those facts, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion.  \n \nIn Guideline B cases, I am required to consider, among other things, the nature \nof a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord to assess the likelihood that an applicant or his family members are vulnerable to \npressure or coercion. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the source \ndocuments included in the FORM and will not be repeated here. I note; however, that \nthe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq due to \nterrorism and armed conflict.\u201d Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups, criminals, and \nmilitias are active in Iraq and regularly attack Iraqi citizens and threaten U.S. personnel \nand interests in Iraq. Human rights abuses continue without punishment for those \ninvolved. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. Under Guideline B, the SOR \nalleged that: his mother, two brothers, and four sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-c); and that one brother works for the Iraqi government in an important \nposition of trust (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline C, the SOR alleged that Applicant applied \nfor employment with the city of Baghdad in 2016, worked there for about six months and \nwent on extended leave in July 2017. He has the ability to return to work at any time \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). Applicant anticipates receiving a pension from the government of Iraq \nstarting at age 50 (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant, his parents and siblings were born and raised in Iraq. He is 50 years \nold. He claimed that in the 1990s, he and a brother protested against the government of \nSaddam Hussein. In 1995, they both left Iraq for Lebanon, afraid for their lives, and \nreceived refugee status. He resided in Lebanon until he entered the United States in \n2000. Applicant married his wife, a U.S. citizen, in 2003, and they have three children, \nages 16, 14, and 12. He became a U.S. citizen in 2008. Applicant stated that he \nrenounced his Iraqi citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSince leaving Iraq, Applicant has maintained close contact with his family \nmembers, most of whom are residents and citizens of Iraq. He has weekly telephone \ncontact with his 73-year-old mother. His most recent in-person contact with his mother, \nsiblings, and friends in Iraq was in 2017.    \n \n \nApplicant has four brothers born and raised in Iraq, ages 59, 53, 43, and 40, and \nfour sisters, ages 51, 47 (2), and 41. The brothers, ages 59 and 40, and all four sisters \nare Iraqi resident-citizens. The 53-year-old brother immigrated to the United States and \nis a naturalized U.S. citizen. The 43-year-old brother is a citizen of Iraq, but residing in a \nforeign country because of his important position of trust for the Iraqi government. \nApplicant has weekly or monthly telephone contact with his brothers and sisters.  \n \n \nApplicant has in-person contact with his siblings, extended family members, and \nfriends whenever he visits Iraq. Applicant has traveled to Iraq frequently, specifically as \nfollows: November 2009 \u2013 March 2010; March 2013 \u2013 April 2013; August 2014 \u2013 \nOctober 2014; June 2015 \u2013 July 2015; May 2016 \u2013 June 2016; and November 2016 \u2013 \nJuly 2017. In addition to his contacts with family members, Applicant communicates \nquarterly with a brother-in-law who is a member of an Iraqi government commission, \nand two to three times a year with a high school classmate. Two of Applicant\u2019s sisters \nare teachers working for the Iraqi government.  \n \n \nDuring his trip to Iraq in November 2016, Applicant applied for a job with the city \nof Baghdad. Applicant used an Iraqi identification card that he renewed in 2008-2009 to \napply for his Iraqi job. He explained that he renewed his Iraqi identification card because \ntravelling within Iraq using U.S. identification documents is dangerous. After working for \nthe city of Baghdad for about six months, Applicant went on extended leave in July \n2017. He is able to return to his job at any time. Applicant took the job with the city of \nBaghdad to earn benefits under an Iraqi government program that allows prior refugees \nto receive a retirement of about $325 monthly starting at age 50.  \n \n \nApplicant initially failed to disclose in his SCA and to government investigators \nduring an interview that he had an Iraqi identification card that he renewed it in 2008-\n2009. He also failed to disclose his use of the Iraqi identification card to travel within \nIraq, or about him using it to obtain employment from the city of Baghdad. Applicant \nomitted during a counterintelligence interview that he was hired by the city of Baghdad, \nand he claimed that he traveled to Iraq three times between November 2016 and July \n2017, when in fact he was working in Baghdad during the whole period. \n \n \nBetween 2006 and about 2015, Applicant conducted business in Iraq by \npurchasing vehicles in the United States and shipping them to Iraqi customers for a \nprofit. His sibling in the United States and those residing in Iraq assisted him with the \nbusiness transactions. \n \nConcerning Iraq, I took administrative notice that the U.S. Department of State \nwarns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous and the ability of the U.S. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nEmbassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk \nfor kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active \nin Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias and criminal elements may also threaten U.S. citizens and \nwestern companies throughout Iraq.  \n \n \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \n  \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, three brothers, and four sisters are citizen-residents of Iraq. \nHe maintains a close relationship with his relatives in Iraq as demonstrated by his \nfrequent contacts, communications, frequent travel, and long stays in Iraq. One of his \nbrothers holds an important position of trust with the government of Iraq. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:    \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nThere is substantial evidence of a significant threat of terror, sectarian violence, \ncriminal activity, and ongoing human rights problems in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts may create a potential conflict of interest, and there is evidence of a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to his family members and their \nconnections to Iraq are sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b).  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:   \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iraq as well as each individual \nfamily tie. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nTravel within Iraq remains very dangerous and the ability of the Iraqi government \nor the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are \nat high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent \ngroups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias and criminal elements may also threaten U.S. citizens and \nwestern companies throughout Iraq. Severe human rights problems are widespread in \nIraq. Sectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of \ngovernment and society weakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective \nhuman rights protections.  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find it is likely that because of his \nrelatives in Iraq, Applicant would be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a family member, an Iraqi person, group, organization, of government \ninterest and the interests of the United States. Additionally, he submitted little evidence \nof his ties to the United States. I considered that Applicant immigrated to the United \nStates in 2000, married his wife (U.S. citizen) in 2003, and they have three children born \nin the United States. I also note his interest in working as a linguist for federal \ncontractors. Notwithstanding, he failed to introduce evidence to demonstrate his \u201cdeep \nand long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States\u201d. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) \nare not mitigated. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the concerns about foreign preference stating: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline C, the SOR alleged that Applicant applied for employment with \nthe city of Baghdad in 2016, worked there for about six months and went on extended \nleave in July 2017. He has the ability to return to work at any time. Applicant anticipates \nreceiving a pension ($325 monthly) from the government of Iraq starting at age 50. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 10 indicates four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, \nor political office in a foreign government or military organization . . . . \n \n \nAlthough not alleged, Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA and to government \ninvestigators that he kept an Iraqi identification card and renewed it in 2008-2009. He \nlater explained to other government investigators that it was dangerous for him to travel \nin Iraq using U.S. identification documents. \n \n \nApplicant used his Iraqi identification card to obtain employment with the \ngovernment of the city of Baghdad in 2016, worked there for about six months, and \nwent on extended leave in July 2017. He has the ability to return to work at any time. He \nanticipates receiving a pension ($325 monthly) from the government of Iraq starting at \nage 50. I find the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 10(d)(1) is established. \n \n \nI considered all of the foreign preference mitigating conditions outlined under AG \n\u00b6 11 and found them to be inapplicable to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 \n11(e): \u201cthe exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not present a \nnational security concern\u201d. I find that under the circumstances of this case, Applicant\u2019s \nexercise of the entitlements or benefits of an Iraqi citizen present a national security \nconcern. He claimed he resigned his Iraqi citizenship, but kept and renewed an Iraqi \nidentification card without providing notice of his actions to U.S. authorities. He then \nused the Iraqi identification card to travel within Iraq, and used it to obtain employment \n\n \n9 \n \n \nand pension rights. I find that his actions indicate a preference for Iraq over the United \nStates. Applicant was less than candid to U.S. authorities about his Iraqi identification \ncard, his employment in Baghdad, and his period working there. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns. Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security of the United States to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated foreign influence and foreign preference \nsecurity concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is \nnot warranted.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n   \n\n \n10 \n \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his February 14, 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (or SCA) by responding negatively to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency involving enforcement (any tax liens in the last seven years and current delinquency on any federal debt) (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and to inquires concerning delinquency on routine accounts (any bills or debts turned over for collection and any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last seven years) (SOR \u00b6 2.b). When he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.e, 1.g-1.h, and 1.j-1.y, but indicated that several of them, including all but one of his medical collection debts, have been paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.x); that he was making payments on his Federal tax debt and had reduced the balance t",

He falsified his February 2018 security clearance application \n(SCA) by denying any financial delinquencies, including any Federal debts. Clearance \neligibility is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 31, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe SOR explained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DoD CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \n\n2 \n \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn December 5, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On April 21, 2020, the Government submitted a File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), including 16 exhibits consisting of its documentary evidence. \nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, and instructed him that any response \nwas due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on May 13, 2020. No \nresponse was received by the June 12, 2020 due date.  \n \nOn June 30, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on July 10, 2020. \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as exhibits 6 and 7 to the FORM summary reports of \npersonal subject interviews (PSIs) of Applicant conducted on August 7, 2007, and October \n17, 2018. The summary reports were included in DOD reports of investigation (ROI) in \nApplicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may \nbe received in evidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is \notherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary reports did not \nbear the authentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following important notice: \n  \nThe enclosed summaries of your Personal Subject Interviews (exhibits \n6 and 7) are being provided to the Administrative Judge for \nconsideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to this [FORM], you can comment on whether the summaries \naccurately reflects [sic] the information you provided to the authorized \ninvestigator(s) and you may make any corrections, additions, deletions, \nand updates necessary to make the summaries clear and accurate. \nAlternatively, you may object on the ground that the reports are \nunauthenticated by a Government witness and the documents may not \nbe considered as evidence. If no objections are raised in your response \nto this FORM, or if you do not respond to this FORM, the Administrative \nJudge may determine that you have waived any objections to the \n\n3 \n \nadmissibility of the summaries and may consider them as evidence in \nyour case. \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe PSI summaries, to comment on them, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the PSI summaries. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. \nIn the absence of any comment or objections, it is reasonable to infer that he does not \nobject to consideration of the summaries or the other documents relied on by the \nGovernment. Accordingly, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through 16, including Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR (GE 3), are accepted into evidence for consideration in this case. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR (GE 1) alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 31, 2019, Applicant \nowed delinquent debts totaling $62,518: charged-off automobile loan debts of $7,305 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and $5,917 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a collection debt of $1,378 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a cable television \ndebt of $231 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); utility debts of $195 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $153 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a \nFederal income tax lien of $28,058 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a loan debt of $8,055 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); an \ninsurance debt of $234 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); a judgment debt of $9,418 (SOR \u00b6 1.y); and medical \ncollection debt totaling $1,574 on 15 accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.j-1.k, and 1.m-1.x). Under \nGuideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his February 14, 2018 \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (or SCA) by responding \nnegatively to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency involving enforcement (any tax \nliens in the last seven years and current delinquency on any federal debt) (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and \nto inquires concerning delinquency on routine accounts (any bills or debts turned over for \ncollection and any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled in the last \nseven years) (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \n \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, \n1.e, 1.g-1.h, and 1.j-1.y, but indicated that several of them, including all but one of his \nmedical collection debts, have been paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.x); that he was making payments \non his Federal tax debt and had reduced the balance to $10,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and that the \njudgment case for $9,418 was \u201cclosed\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.y). Applicant denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c-1.d and 1.f, stating that they had been paid, and SOR \u00b6 1.i, stating that the account \nwas closed. Applicant admitted the alleged falsifications of his SCA and explained that he \nhad not checked into his tax issue. He added that he was working diligently to correct all of \nhis delinquencies; that the majority of his debts had been paid, and he was working \ntowards paying off the others; and that he currently had only two delinquent accounts on \nhis credit report. (GE 3.) \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (GE 3), \nI make the following findings of fact: \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor (company X) involved in \nground-based operational surveillance systems. He has worked in the defense industry \nsince his July 2010 discharge from the United States military. (GEs 5, 7.) Applicant married \nhis current spouse in January 2018. His first marriage ended in divorce in June 2012. \nApplicant has a 24-year-old son from his first marriage with whom he has no contact. (GE \n7.) Applicant has a 19-year-old stepson and a six-year-old adopted daughter with his \ncurrent wife. (GEs 5, 7.) \n \nOn his graduation from high school in June 1990, Applicant enlisted in the United \nStates Marine Corps. He was granted a DOD secret clearance for his military duties. \nApplicant and his first wife married in June 1995, and they apparently had financial \nproblems from the start. On April 8, 1997, they filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \nThe evidentiary record about the bankruptcy consists of a case summary that shows it \ncovered consumer debt and was discharged on October 23, 2001. The case summary \ndoes not show the creditors, debt amounts, or payments to a trustee. (GE 9.)  \n \n While serving at the rank of staff sergeant, Applicant completed an SCA on May 10, \n2007, to renew his security clearance eligibility for his military duties. He responded \nnegatively to all questions regarding issues of potential security concern, including financial \nrecord inquiries into whether he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the \nlast seven years and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. He \nindicated on his SCA that he and his first wife had been separated since December 3, \n2002. (GE 4.)  \n \n On August 7, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about some adverse information that was \napparently on his credit record at the time. Applicant explained that he and his spouse \nwere in divorce proceedings, and she had his power of attorney. He denied knowledge of \nthe debts on his credit record except for a car loan for a vehicle that was voluntarily \nrepossessed around 2005. He indicated that he would investigate the eight accounts of \nconcern on his credit record and attempt to pay his legitimate debts. With $678 per month \ngoing to his estranged wife and $1,886 in recurring expenses (rent, utilities, insurance, \n$316 car payment, gasoline, food, cable and Internet, and cell phone costs), he estimated \nthat he had about $914 per month for discretionary expenses and to pay past-due debts. \n(GE 6.) \n \nOn October 18, 2007, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility \n(DON CAF) granted Applicant a secret clearance despite expressed concerns about the \npast-due debts then on his credit record and his failure to list those debts on his SCA. \nApplicant was advised of the seriousness of financial irresponsibility and required to \nimmediately contact his command\u2019s financial counselor for assistance in making \narrangements to resolve his delinquent debts. The DON CAF warned him that failure to \naddress his delinquent debts would be cause for reconsideration of his eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant was also reminded that he is responsible for ensuring that \nany future SCAs are complete and accurate prior to their submission. (GE 8.) \n \n\n5 \n \nIn July 2010, Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. military. He worked \nas a trainer for a defense contractor for about a year before relocating in August 2011 to \nhis current area for a position with company X. In December 2013, he accepted a training \nconsultant position with another defense contractor. (GE 5.) \n \nOn February 14, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of an SCA \non which he responded negatively to all the financial record inquiries, including the \nfollowing: \n \nIn the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or \nother taxes when required by law or ordinance?; In the last seven (7) years, \n[have] you had a judgment entered against you . . . ; In the last seven (7) \nyears, [have] you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay \ntaxes or other debts . . . ; [Are] you currently delinquent on any Federal debt. \n. . .; In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to \na collection agency? . . .; and In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had \nany account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to \npay as agreed? . . .  (GE 5.) \n \n \nAs of March 1, 2018, one or more of the three credit reporting agencies were \nreporting that Applicant owed delinquent debt on several accounts. (GE 14.) The record \nevidence for each debt in the SOR is as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a charged-off automobile loan debt for $7,305. (GE 1.) Applicant and a \nco-borrower obtained a loan for $13,295 in October 2014. The loan became delinquent in \nOctober 2016. In June 2017, the account was charged off for $7,891. (GEs 14-16.) \nApplicant asserts that his ex-wife was supposed to make the payments (GE 7), but he did \nnot explain why she would be responsible for a loan that credit reports show was opened \nafter his divorce was final. After a $1,457 payment in August 2018, the balance of the debt \nwas $7,305. (GE 16.) There is no evidence of any subsequent payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off vehicle loan for $5,917. (GE 1.) Applicant obtained a \n$25,525 loan for a truck in October 2013. Applicant made no payments on the loan after \nJune 2015, and his truck was repossessed. In September 2015, his account was charged \noff for $5,916. When interviewed by an authorized investigator for the OPM in October \n2018, Applicant surmised that the $5,916 must be the deficiency balance on his loan. He \nindicated that was never told that he had to pay the remaining balance on the loan after the \ntruck was sold, but that he would pay the debt if required. (GE 7.) As of March 2020, \nApplicant had made no payments toward that debt, which was still adversely affecting his \ncredit. (GEs 14-16.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a collection debt for $1,378. (GE 1.) Applicant moved in with his \ncurrent spouse in November 2017. (GE 5.) In March 7, 2018, a default judgment was \nentered against Applicant for $1,378 in restitution and court costs owed to a property \nmanagement company. (GE 13.) As of April 2019, the debt was in collection with a $1,378 \nbalance. (GE 15.) He claims he paid the debt. (GE 3.) As of March 2020, the debt was no \n\n6 \n \nlonger on his credit report (GE 16), but the court was reporting no progress by Applicant on \nresolving the judgment debt. (GE 13.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a satellite television debt in collection for $231. (GE 1.) A delinquent \nbalance of $231 from March 2015 was placed for collection in March 2018. As of March \n2019, the debt had not been paid. (GE 15.) The debt was no longer on his credit report as \nof March 2020. (GE 16.) Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but he provided no \ncorroboration for his assertion. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a medical collection debt for $200. (GE 1.) In February 2018, a medical \ncreditor placed a $200 debt from September 2017 for collection. As of February 2020, the \ndebt had not been paid. (GEs 15-16.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a $195 collection debt for utility services. (GE 1.) A $195 debt from \nMarch 2018 was placed for collection in May 2019. (GE 15.) Applicant paid the debt on \nOctober 18, 2019. (GE 16.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a $153 collection debt for utility services with the same creditor named \nin SOR \u00b6 1.f. (GE 1.) The account became delinquent in September 2015, and the creditor \nplaced a $152 balance for collection in November 2016. The debt had not been paid. (GEs \n3, 15-16.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is a Federal tax lien for $28,058. (GE 1.) On November 1, 2016, a \nFederal tax lien of $28,058.76 was filed against Applicant for unpaid taxes and \nassessments of $2,209.59 for tax year 2011, $1,190.45 for tax year 2012, and $24,658.72 \nfor tax year 2013. (GEs 10, 14.) The Federal tax lien was issued to Applicant at the \naddress where he resided from February 2011 to August 2011. (GEs 5, 10.) As of March \n2018, the debt had not been paid. (GE 14.) Applicant denied any knowledge of the tax lien \nas of October 2018. (GE 7.) In December 2019, he asserted that he was currently making \npayments and that the balance was $10,000 (GE 3.) He provided no evidence of any \npayments or a more recent assessment by the IRS to substantiate the claimed balance. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a loan in collection for $8,055. (GE 1.) As of March 2018, Equifax was \nreporting that Applicant was a co-maker on a loan that was referred for collection in \nJanuary 2019 because of nonpayment since November 2011. (GE 14.) The debt was no \nlonger on his credit record as of April 2019. (GE 15.) Applicant disputes the debt and \nindicates that the account is closed. (GE 3.) He provided no proof that he is not legally \nliable for repayment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a $342 medical debt in collection. (GE 1.) A medical debt from October \n2013 was assigned for collection in January 2014. As of February 2018, the debt balance \nof $342 had not been paid. (GE 14.) The debt was no longer on his credit record as of April \n2019. Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but he submitted no evidence of payment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a $237 medical debt in collection. (GE 1.) The debt was reportedly in \ncollection as of March 2018. (GE 14.) It was no longer on his credit record as of April 2019. \n\n7 \n \n(GE 15.) Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but he submitted no evidence of \npayment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is an insurance debt in collection for $234. (GE 1.) The account became \ndelinquent in June 2015 and was assigned for collection in September 2015. As of March \n2020, the $234 balance had not been paid. (GEs 14, 16.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is a medical debt in collection for $125. (GE 1.) The debt, which is from \nFebruary 2018, had not been paid as of March 2018. (GE 14.) As of April 2019, the debt \nwas no longer on his credit record. (GE 15.) Applicant claims it has been paid (GE 3), but \nhe submitted no evidence of payment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.x are medical debts in collection, ranging from a low of $22 to a high \nof $99 and totaling $670. (GE 1.) The debts were incurred between October 2012 and \nOctober 2015. Applicant had not paid them as of March 2018. (GE 14.) The debts had \nbeen dropped from his credit record by April 2019. (GE 15.) Applicant claims all of those \nmedical debts have been paid (GE 3), but he submitted no evidence of payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.y is a $9,418 judgment debt from February 2018. (GE 1.) On November \n21, 2017, a creditor filed for a judgment against Applicant and a co-debtor. On February 1, \n2018, a default judgment was entered against them for $9,418.91. (GE 11.) The debt does \nnot appear on Applicant\u2019s credit reports from March 2018 (GE 14), April 2019 (GE 15), or \nMarch 2020 (GE 16). On July 9, 2018, Applicant\u2019s then employer reported to the DOD CAF \nthat the company had received an order of garnishment. (GE 12.) Later that month, \nApplicant became re-employed by company X, who won the contact from the company that \nfiled the incident report. (GE 7.) Applicant was credited with payments totaling $2,736.93 \nbetween July 2, 2018, and August 28, 2018, to reduce the debt balance to $7,135. (GE \n11.) It is unclear whether those payments were made through wage garnishment. Applicant \npresented no evidence of any subsequent payments toward the $7,135 balance.  \n  \n \nOn October 17, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe OPM about the delinquent accounts reported on his credit record as of March 2018 and \nabout his failure to list them on his February 2018 SCA. He volunteered that he had several \naccounts placed for collection, including medical debts for allegedly unbilled co-payments, \nand that he also had a truck repossessed. His explanation for not listing any debts on his \nSCA was that he lacked information regarding the accounts. He asserted that his former \nspouse had opened accounts in his name without his knowledge, and she failed to pay the \nbills. He did not realize that his ex-wife had damaged his credit until after their divorce, \nwhen accounts became delinquent, and he could not afford to pay them. When confronted \nabout the specific debts, Applicant stated that he first became aware of them when they \nwent to collections. He claimed to have paid all but four of his medical debts in collection. \nHe believed the $342 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.j) had not been paid, but indicated that he \nwould address all of his remaining medical collection debts within the next few months. \nApplicant did not recognize the $153 utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.g), the $234 insurance debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l), or the $237 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and $59 (SOR \u00b6 1.t) medical debts. He surmised that \nthe $8,055 collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) was opened by his former spouse without his \n\n8 \n \nknowledge. He claimed that the $7,305 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was on a joint loan for his ex-\nwife\u2019s vehicle. He acknowledged that the $5,917 deficiency balance (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was for \nhis repossessed truck. Applicant denied any knowledge of the Federal tax lien, but \nindicated that he would look into it. He asserted that he lives within his means and that he \nhad not filed for bankruptcy or received any credit counseling. Applicant did not avail \nhimself of opportunities during and after the interview to submit documentation regarding \nhis financial issues. (GE 7.) \n \nThe DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant on October 31, 2019, because of the \noutstanding delinquencies on his credit record and because of his failure to list any past-\ndue debts on his February 2018 SCA. (GE 1.) In response, Applicant stated in December \n2019 that several of his debts had been paid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.f, 1.j-1.x), and that he had \nmade payments to reduce the balance of his Federal tax delinquency to $10,000. (GE 3.) \nHe provided no documentation showing satisfaction of any debts, although his latest credit \nreport (GE 16) corroborates the payment of the $195 utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant \ndisputed the $8,055 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i), stating that it was \u201cclosed,\u201d although he provided no \ndocumentation to substantiate his dispute. He acknowledged the $9,418 judgment debt, \nbut indicated that it had been \u201cclosed.\u201d Applicant maintained that he was working diligently \nto correct all his debts, and that he had only two delinquent accounts currently on his credit \nrecord. Applicant responded \u201cAccept\u201d to the alleged falsifications of his February 2018 \nSCA, but added that he had not checked for the tax lien and was working on his tax debts. \n(GE 3.) \n \nAs of March 2020, Equifax was reporting three unpaid collection debts, of $200 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), $153 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), and $234 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), and the two charged-off vehicle loan \nbalances of $7,305 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $5,917 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant was making timely \npayments of $316 per month on an unsecured installment loan opened in May 2015 for \n$12,352 and on a credit card opened in July 2019 with a credit limit of $5,000. Applicant \npaid $300, which was more than his monthly scheduled payment of $101, to reduce the \nbalance to $5,048 as of February 2020. Applicant was also making timely payments of \n$454 per month on a vehicle loan with a $22,016 balance that was obtained in December \n2019. (GE 16.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n\n9 \n \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \n\n10 \n \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Available court records, the notice of Federal tax \nlien, and credit reports substantiate Applicant\u2019s record of financial delinquency on the SOR \ndebts, except perhaps for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Applicant\u2019s denial of the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d, 1.f because of payment is not a dispute as to his legal liability for or the \ndelinquency of those debts. Applicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report shows that the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f was paid in October 2019. There is no evidence confirming payment of the other \ndebts. \n \nApplicant denies the $8,055 loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Under \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, \nthe Government bears the burden of establishing controverted allegations. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence consists of a single credit listing on Applicant\u2019s March 2018 credit \nreport showing that he was a co-maker on the account, which was placed for collection in \nJanuary 2017 after inactivity since November 2011. During his August 2018 PSI, Applicant \nsurmised that the debt may have been incurred by his ex-wife without his knowledge. \nUnder Equifax\u2019s reporting codes, a co-maker (or co-signer) is a guarantor and liable for \nrepayment if the borrower defaults. Applicant has not accepted payment responsibility for \nthe debt. He indicates that the account has been \u201cclosed,\u201d but he provided no details. Even \nassuming he has no legal liability for that debt, his delinquency in excess of $50,000 on the \nother SOR accounts amply establishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n11 \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply, even though several of the accounts first \nbecame delinquent over four years ago. Applicant\u2019s Federal tax liability is for tax years \n2011, 2012, and 2013. His medical collection debts were largely incurred between October \n2012 and October 2015. He defaulted on his truck loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b in 2015, and he and a \nco-borrower defaulted on the vehicle loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2016. The satellite television \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, the utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and the insurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l, are \nfrom 2015. However, none of those debts had been resolved as of his February 14, 2018 \nSCA. Financial judgments were entered against him in February 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.y) and \nMarch 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). His lack of documented progress on resolving the debts after he \nbecame aware of them precludes favorable consideration of AG \u00b6 20(a). His debts are \nconsidered recent because an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing \ncourse of conduct. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2018) (citing e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \n \n \nDuring his October 2018 PSI, Applicant stated that his ex-wife opened accounts in \nhis name that he learned of after their divorce, and she left him with the bills, which he \ncould not afford. While such a circumstance could be a mitigating factor under AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant did not provide proof of debts incurred in his name without his knowledge. \nAccording to the credit reports in the record, the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a was not obtained \nuntil October 2014. He and his first wife divorced in June 2012. Applicant may not have \nknown about the Federal income tax lien before his PSI. The lien was apparently mailed to \nhim at an old address. However, he failed to explain how he could have been unaware of \nhis tax liability. Even assuming that his ex-wife held a power of attorney during their \nmarriage, he was divorced well before his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nand 2013 would have been due. Some $24,658 of his Federal tax delinquency is for tax \n\n12 \n \nyear 2013. The medical collection debts also post-date his divorce. His claim that he was \nnot billed for the debts is difficult to believe, given the number of accounts (15) referred for \ncollection. He obtained the truck loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) in October 2013, more than a year after \nhis divorce was final. It was not adequately shown that his default of his truck loan was \ncaused by factors outside of his control rather than by financial irresponsibility. \nFurthermore, Applicant does not receive full mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because he \ndid not establish that he acted reasonably with respect to resolving his old delinquencies. \nHe indicated during his October 2018 PSI that he would investigate the debts on his credit \nrecord and arrange for repayment, but he presented no documentation of any such efforts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report corroborates that the $195 utility debt from \nMarch 2018 was paid in October 2019. Applicant claimed in December 2019 that he had \nalso paid several other debts, including most of his medical debts and the $1,378 debt \nowed to a former landlord. Given that most of his medical collection debts were small (less \nthan $100), he could have paid many of them. Yet it is difficult to accept his \nunsubstantiated claims of debt satisfaction for even those debts, given the issues about his \ncredibility, not only because of his failure to report any delinquent debts on his SCA, but \nalso because the court record shows no payments toward the $1,378 as of March 2020. \nMoreover, even if he satisfied most of the medical collection accounts, he has not had any \nfinancial counseling, which is required under AG \u00b6 20(c), and he has not made any \npayments toward the $13,222 in charged-off vehicle loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) or towards the \n$7,135 balance of judgment debt in SOR \u00b6 1.y. While he is not required to establish that he \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board stated in ISCR \nCase No. 17-00263 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan \nfor debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences \na serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have minimal applicability. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies only to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, which was paid before the SOR \nwas issued. Applicant provided no documentation to corroborate his dispute of the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, so AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to that debt. Applicant\u2019s unsubstantiated claims of \ntax payments to reduce his Federal income tax delinquency to $10,000 as of December \n2019 fall short of the evidence needed to establish mitigation of his significant tax liability \nunder AG \u00b6 20(g). \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s March 2020 credit report contains some positive financial indicators. He has \nmade timely payments of $316 per month on an unsecured installment loan opened in May \n2015 for $12,352 and on a credit card opened in July 2019 with a credit limit of $5,000, \nalthough as of February 2020, the balance on that account exceeded his credit limit by \n$48. He was making timely payments on a vehicle loan obtained in December 2019 for \n$22,351, but he has yet to establish a sufficient track record of timely payments on that \naccount to guarantee that he can be counted on to make his $454 monthly payments on \n\n13 \n \ntime. However, a reasonably accurate assessment of Applicant\u2019s financial situation cannot \nbe made without knowing his present income and expenses. It cannot yet be determined \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are behind him. The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nApplicant responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries on his February \n14, 2018 SCA, including questions concerning whether, in the last seven years, he had a \nlien placed against his property for failure to pay taxes or other debts; whether he was \ncurrently delinquent on any Federal debt; whether he had any bills or debts turned over to \na collection agency in the last seven years; and whether, in the last seven years, he had \nany accounts or credit cards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay them \non agreed upon terms. Without an opportunity to confront Applicant in person and assess \nhis credibility on the issue, it is particularly difficult to discount the objective evidence of \nfinancial delinquency that clearly should have been reported on his SCA. Applicant does \nthat dispute that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the lien and Federal debt inquiries, but explained that \nhe \u201chad not checked.\u201d  He denied any knowledge of the tax lien when he was interviewed \nby an OPM investigator in October 2018. There is no evidence that Applicant ever received \nthe Notice of Tax Lien. Applicant had moved from the address on the notice in August \n2011, and the forwarding time would have expired as of the issuance of the tax lien in \nNovember 2016. That being said, it is difficult to believe he did not know that he owed back \ntaxes for 2013, given the IRS assessment of $24,658 for that year. Applicant clearly knew \nthat he had lost a truck to repossession within the seven years preceding his February \n2018 SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \n\n14 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) and AG \u00b6 17(e) have some applicability because Applicant volunteered \nduring his October 2018 PSI that he had accounts go into collections and had a vehicle \nrepossessed. A generalized admission to financial delinquency some eight months after his \nSCA falsification does not fully mitigate the personal conduct security concerns in this \ncase, however. He indicated that he had paid all but four of his medical collection accounts \nbut that he was unable to recall details about his accounts. He claimed not to know why a \ntax lien was issued against him.  Applicant was advised by the DON CAF in October 2007 \nthat he is responsible for ensuring that any future SCAs be complete and accurate prior to \ntheir submission. His false denials to the SCA\u2019s financial record inquiries in February 2018 \nraise considerable concerns about his reform. His explanation for denying any debts on his \nFebruary 2018 SCA\u2014that he lacked all the information about the debts\u2014does not justify \nhis knowing omission of delinquent debts. Persuasive evidence is lacking on the issue of \nwhether the Government can reasonably rely on Applicant\u2019s representations. The personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n\n15 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nApplicant was cautioned by the DON CAF in October 2007 that financial \nirresponsibility has serious implications for his continued security clearance eligibility. He \nlargely attributes his record of subsequent financial delinquency to his ex-wife, who left him \nwith some bills that strained his finances, but several accounts were opened by him after \nhis divorce. \n \n \nIt was incumbent on Applicant to show that his financial situation is sufficiently stable \nand not likely to present an ongoing security concern. As discussed above, too many \nunanswered questions exist about his financial situation. Moreover, because Applicant \nchose to have his security clearance eligibility evaluated without a hearing, I was unable to \nassess his sincerity and demeanor. The record evidence left me with doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s candor with respect to his SCA omissions. He presented no employment or \ncharacter references attesting to his judgment and reliability in handling his personal and \nwork affairs. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until \nan applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or \nrevoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. \n29, 2009, citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled \nthat once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n16 \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.y: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 23, \n2015. On January 3, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 10, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March \n11, 2020, and the case was assigned to me on June 17, 2020. On July 14, 2020, the \n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for July 20, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant waived the \n15-day notice required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. (Tr. 12.) Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and \n2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR included \nthree documents, which have been marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A, B, and C. At \nthe hearing, Applicant testified and submitted AX D. AX A through D were admitted \nwithout objection. I kept the record open until August 3, 2020, to enable him to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX E through H, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 29, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old systems administrator employed by a federal \ncontractor since April 2012. In July 2011, he moved from his previous residence, where \nhe lived with his mother, to the city where he now lives. He has lived at his current \naddress since February 2015. He was employed in various private-sector jobs from \nMarch 2007 until he was hired by his current employer. He received a security \nclearance in June 2012.  \n \n \nApplicant attended a community college from September 2009 to January 2010 \nbut did not receive a degree. He attended a technical school from August 2011 to \nFebruary 2012 and received a certificate in information technology. He has never \nmarried. He and his cohabitant have a daughter, born in December 2019. (Answer at 4.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts, which are reflected in a credit report \nfrom March 2019. The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: auto loan charged off for $22,656. Applicant disclosed this debt \nwhen he submitted his SCA in February 2015, and he explained that he was trying to \nset up a payment plan to resolve it. He had purchased a three-year-old used car in April \n2013 and financed it with a loan of about $22,000. (GX 2.) The loan was cosigned by \nhis mother. He neglected to obtain insurance for the car, as required by his loan \ncontract, and the lender bought insurance on his behalf. (AX D.) He made his loan \npayments on time until about April 2014.  \n \nWhen Applicant applied for a title to the car, he learned that there was an \noutstanding citation for a fire-lane violation in his previous state of residence, and it cost \nhim about $1,300 to resolve it. (Tr. 39-40.) About two months after he purchased the \ncar, he damaged the right side when he struck a tree branch, and he incurred repair \ncosts of an unspecified amount. The repairs were poorly done, which depreciated the \nvalue of the car. (Tr. 20-21.) At about the same time, his student-loan payments of $325 \nper month became due, and he fell behind on his car payments in order to make the \nstudent-loan payments. (Tr. 22.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant parked the car within the condominium property where he resided while \nhe went on vacation for 10 days. When he returned from vacation, he found that the car \nhad been impounded by the condominium association because it was parked in an area \nrequiring a permit. The car was impounded for 43 days, and the condominium charged \nhim about $150 or $200 per day for storage, which he could not afford. (Tr. 17, 31-33) \nThe lender for the car loan intended to repossess it, but could not reach an agreement \nwith the condominium association to gain access to it. Applicant testified that he does \nnot know whether the condominium association disposed of the car. He testified that he \nbelieved that insurance company from whom the lender purchased insurance treated \nthe car as a total loss and settled the debt with the lender. (Tr. 17.) In April 2014, the \nlender charged off the loan for $22,029, and the account was closed. (AX C at 9; AX E.)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that the debt was forgiven by the \nlender, and he was waiting for the lender to send him an IRS Form 1099-C. (Answer at \n1.) As of the date the record closed, he had not received the form, because it will be \nissued for tax year 2021. (Tr. 29.)  \n \nApplicant remained in contact with the lender, as evidenced by the lender\u2019s \ncorrespondence in December 2017, refunding some of the insurance premiums paid to \nthe lender because of overlapping insurance coverage (AX D.) At the hearing, he \ntestified that the lender sent the documentation showing resolution of the debt to his \nmother, who had cosigned the loan, but that she no longer had the documentation and \nprobably had disposed of it, thinking that the matter was resolved. (Tr. 28.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: delinquent medical bill for $131. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe stated that this debt was a co-payment that was paid but not processed because of \nchange of health-insurance companies. It was referred for collection in February 2018. \n(GX 2 at 2.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated the bill was paid in full on February 6, \n2020. He submitted a copy of the bill, on which he had written \u201cpaid,\u201d but he provided no \ndocumentation of payment. (AX A.) In his post-hearing submission, he submitted a \ncredit report reflecting that the account was referred to a collection agency, that the \noriginal amount was $77 (reflected as \u201chigh credit\u201d in GX 2), had increased to $131 in \nFebruary 2019 (the amount alleged in the SOR and reflected in GX 2), and was paid in \nfull in February 2020. (AX F at 4.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account referred for collection of $45. The date of last \nactivity on this account was in June 2013, and it was referred for collection in February \n2015. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he paid this bill in full on April 3, \n2020. He provided documentation of a zero balance on this account. (AX B.))  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he earns about $74,000 per year. He owns a car that is \ndebt free, his student loans are paid, and he has no delinquent debts. (Tr. 29.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s senior program manager, who has known him for eight years, \nsubmitted a statement supporting Applicant\u2019s application to continue his clearance. He \n\n \n4 \n \nstated that Applicant has \u201cgrown immensely\u201d as a person and as a technician during the \ntime he has known him and has received multiple promotions because of his hard work \nand technical skills. (AX G.) \n \n \nThe chief of the regional network center for whom Applicant works has known \nhim since August 2017. He regards Applicant as \u201cextremely dependable,\u201d one of their \nbest employees, and has a work ethic unmatched by his peers. (AX H.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \n\n \n5 \n \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish two following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d).  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n\n \n6 \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and \nmultiple. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts reflect a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as \u201crecent\u201d for the purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions. ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). Although \nApplicant\u2019s debts are \u201crecent,\u201d he receives some mitigating credit based on the passage \nof time. The delinquent car loan is the main item of concern in this case, and it was \nincurred more than six years ago and was the result of Applicant\u2019s immaturity and \ninexperience.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts were incurred under circumstances making them \nunlikely to recur. The car loan was charged off more than six years ago. He now has a \ngood job and is financially secure. The testimonials of his supervisors indicate that he \nhas matured and become a responsible and dependable employee. He has paid off his \nstudent loans, purchased a car that is debt free, and has incurred no other delinquent \ndebts. I am satisfied that his previous financial irresponsibility is unlikely to recur and \nthat the six-year-old charged-off debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a does not cast doubt on the \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant bought a car that he could not afford. He \nparked it in a restricted area, causing it to be impounded. He incurred a large fine and \npenalties for a fire-lane violation. These circumstances do not qualify as conditions \nlargely beyond his control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. Applicant \nhas not submitted documentary evidence that the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nhas been resolved.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n\n \n7 \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, \nsincere, and credible at the hearing. He has held a security clearance since June 2012, \napparently without incident. He has worked steadily to achieve financial stability. He has \nmatured and become financially responsible. He received strong endorsements from his \nsupervisors.  \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that he has resolved all his delinquent debts except \nfor the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He has remained in contact with this creditor and has \nmade good-faith efforts to obtain documentation showing resolution of the debt. The \ndebt is more than six years old and is not indicative of Applicant\u2019s current judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.
