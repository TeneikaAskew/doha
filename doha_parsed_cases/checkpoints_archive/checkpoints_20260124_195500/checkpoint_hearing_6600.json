Applicant answered the SOR 24 October 2008, and requested\n1\na decision without hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 11 June 2009. The record in\nthis case closed 21 May 2009, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) was due.\nJune 30, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, and a January 2007 domestic\ndispute (SOR 3.a.). He denied the falsification allegations. He is a 51-year-old electronic\nmaintenance technician employed by a defense contractor since July 2004. He appears\nof have held a clearance while in the U.S. Army 1975-1995.\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and government exhibits substantiate, ten\ndelinquent debts totaling over $28,000. Five of the debts are medical debts totaling less\nthan $750. He claimed, without corroboration to have paid two medical debts totaling\n$52 in October 2008, and to be paying two more totaling $128 in November 2008. He\nhas not contacted any of the remaining creditors.\nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his separation and divorce in 2000,\nand being unemployed from February 2001 to July 2004. He provided no explanation\nwhy he was not able to find any employment between 2001 and 2004. \nWhen Applicant applied for a security clearance in July 2006 (Item 4), he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to two questions (28.a. and b.) eliciting any recent financial\ndelinquencies However, he stated in the remarks section: \u201cI\u2019m not too sure of my current\ncredit status. During the period of 2001 to July 2004 I was unemployed, and used up all\nof my financial resources. I couldn\u2019t pay any of my creditors and as a result, my credit\nratings were extremely poor.\u201d\nSince becoming employed full-time in July 2004, Applicant has paid three\ndelinquent medical bills (not alleged) totaling about $300. He looked into debt\nconsolidation, but took no action because he could not afford the monthly payment or\nadministrative fees. His financial statement reflects positive monthly cash flow of $134.\nIn January 2007, Applicant got into a verbal altercation with a person who was\nharboring his runaway step-daughter. Because he was alleged to have brandished a\nbaseball bat during the dispute, he was arrested for \u201cterroristic threat.\u201d The prosecutor\ndeclined prosecution and the charges were dismissed.    \nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) . . . the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent\n3\nto pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n6\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n3\nF (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. While Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nare reasonably attributable to his divorce in 2000 and his loss of employment in 2001,\nhe has been unwilling to take effective action to address his debts despite being\nemployed full time since July 2004.3\nApplicant meets only one of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  While his separation and\n4\nunemployment are clear circumstances beyond his control, he got a new job in July\n2004, and he has not acted responsibly in addressing his debts since then.  There is no\n5\nevidence that he has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under\ncontrol.  There is very little evidence, and no corroboration, of a good-faith effort to\n6\n\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n4\nsatisfy his debts.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling,\n7\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial problems\nbehind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government did not establish a case for disqualification under Guidelines E\nand J. Department Counsel acknowledged in the FORM that Applicant\u2019s general\ndisclosure that he used up all his financial assets and stopped paying his creditors when\nhe was unemployed was adequate disclosure of the delinquencies for which he lacked\nspecifics. Both the circumstances and the disposition of the threat case suggest it lacks\nsecurity significance. I resolve Guidelines E and J for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a- j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 47 years old and has been employed by his employer since August 1988. He is currently a range technician. He has held a security clearance since 1989. He seeks a Secret clearance. There are 14 delinquent debt allegations listed under paragraph 1 (financial considerations) of the SOR. Applicant admitted most of the debts and/or stated that four other debts belonged to his brother. Applicant denied subparagraph 1.e. without 1 explanation or any independent evidence to support his position. The 14 delinquent accounts total $19,136.00. Most of the accounts are credit cards, and one account ($1,869.00) represents the balance due after Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed in 2005. Two debts were transferred for collection more than five years ago in 2002, and four debts were transferred for collection recently in 2006. As of the date of the hearing (December 18, 2007), Applicant had made no payment on any of the listed debts.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on October 16,\n2006. On August 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 31, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on October 25,\n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 3, 2007, and the case was heard\non December 18, 2007. The government offered 4 exhibits (GE1-4). Applicant testified\non his own behalf. He offered no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\nJanuary 31, 2008\n\n Applicant provided no documentation to support his claim that four of the debts belonged to his brother.\n1\n2\n(Tr.) on January 4, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 47 years old and has been employed by his employer since August\n1988. He is currently a range technician. He has held a security clearance since 1989.\nHe seeks a Secret clearance. \nThere are 14 delinquent debt allegations listed under paragraph 1 (financial\nconsiderations) of the SOR. Applicant admitted most of the debts and/or stated that four\nother debts belonged to his brother.  Applicant denied subparagraph 1.e. without\n1\nexplanation or any independent evidence to support his position. \nThe 14 delinquent accounts total $19,136.00. Most of the accounts are credit\ncards, and one account ($1,869.00) represents the balance due after Applicant\u2019s car\nwas repossessed in 2005. Two debts were transferred for collection more than five\nyears ago in 2002, and four debts were transferred for collection recently in 2006. As of\nthe date of the hearing (December 18, 2007), Applicant had made no payment on any\nof the listed debts. \nOn June 15, 2007, Applicant provided information (GE 2, answers to\ninterrogatories) pertaining to his financial obligations. In his personal financial statement\n(PFS), a form provided by the government for applicants to fill in their gross and monthly\nincome, monthly expenses, monthly debt, net remainder, and assets, Applicant\nprovided estimates of his monthly income and expenses. He indicated his gross\nmonthly pay was 1,438.46, his net pay was $1017.58 a month, with monthly expenses\nof $400.00 in groceries, $200.00 in car expenses, and $510.50 a month in child support.\nHe indicated in the PFS, and in other locations of the exhibit that he was making no\npayments towards the listed debts. \nIn GE 2, Applicant also stated he intended to place the listed debts in a\nconsolidation plan to pay them off. He noted he was a single parent helping his two\ndaughters with their education expenses. When asked at the hearing about his\ncontributions for his daughters\u2019 education, he testified he was paying $350.00 a month\nto support one daughter in nursing school, and about $150.00 a month for the other\ndaughter in college. \nAt the hearing, Applicant provided more information about his indebtedness.\nWhile all his explanations will be reviewed, I find the primary reason he slid into financial\ndifficulty was a lack of management of his finances. He stated, \u201cI think I just got lax on it\nand didn\u2019t pay attention. I make good money.\u201d (Tr. 20) Another of his explanations was\nthat in August 1997, his mother and father lived with him for about six months while she\nrecuperated from a broken hip. Applicant was also raising three children at the time.\n\n These figures are different from those provided in his answers to interrogatories. (GE 2) Applicant\n2\nprovided no explanation for the discrepancy. \n3\nAfter his parents returned to their home, he began receiving phone calls from creditors\ndemanding payment. He recalled telling them he would initiate repayment after the\ncreditors submitted verification he was responsible for the debts.\nApplicant also provided more information about his earnings at the hearing. He\nhas been employed by his current employer for 18 years, living in a trailer on his\nemployer\u2019s land without having to pay rent, or a mortgage, or utilities. He also provides\nafter hours security for his employer. He quoted his net earnings at about $2,000.00 a\nmonth.  Whether his earnings from the security job are included in his monthly net\n2\nearnings is unknown. Applicant\u2019s monthly bills include (1) a car payment of $350.00 for\na car he recently purchased, (2) $80.00 in car insurance, (3) $500.00 in education\nexpense for his daughters, (4) $300.00 in groceries, and (5) a cable bill. Assuming the\ncable bill is $75.00 a month, and subtracting the expenses from his net monthly\nearnings, the total monthly remainder is approximately $700.00. In addition to the net\nremainder, Applicant estimated he had about $10,000.00 in his retirement account. \nApplicant was aware of the delinquent debts when he filled out the SCA in\nOctober 2006, and when he received the SOR in August 2007. In his answer to the\nSOR, Applicant indicated several of the debts were the responsibility of his brother.\nThose debts are identified in subparagraphs 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.h., and 1.n. of the SOR.\nWhen asked why he accused his brother of certain debts, Applicant claims he did not\nknow his brother was establishing credit in Applicant\u2019s name. No additional information\nwas provided. Applicant testified he intended to pay off his brother\u2019s debts too. \nThough he has never contacted any of the creditors, he declared he would start\npaying off the debts in June 2008. Applicant has never had financial counseling. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG, the\nentire process is a careful thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nInability to pay bills on time places the individual debtor at risk of committing\nillegal acts to generate funds. \nAnalysis\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems percolated in August 1997 when his parents came\nto live with him. He recalled the creditors began contacting about delinquent accounts\nshortly after his parents departed. Ten years later, Applicant owes 14 creditors\n$19,136.00. Some of the debts became delinquent in 2002 while others did not reach\nthe delinquent status until various dates in 2006. The disqualifying conditions (DC)\nraised by Applicant\u2019s overdue debts are FC DC 19.a. \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts,\u201d and FC DC 19.c. \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of more than $19,000.00 in debt by August 3, 2007 shows an inability to\npay creditors, and also demonstrates a record of not paying debts that he voluntarily\ncreates. \n\n5\nThere are only two mitigating conditions (MC) potentially available for Applicant.\nFC MC 20.a. \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The accumulation of four of 14\ndelinquent debts falling delinquent less than two years ago militates against the\napplicability of FC MC 19.a. \nFC MC 19.b. \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted reasonably under the\ncircumstances\u201d receives some favorable consideration based on the financial burden\nApplicant confronted when he had to provide for his parents and three children.\nHowever, the passage of nine years of uninterrupted employment provides little or no\nmitigation for Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his past due debts. \nApplicant also attributed his failure to pay the listed debt on the $500.00 a month\ncontribution he is making towards his daughters\u2019 education. Applicant is to be\ncommended for helping his daughter\u2019s realize their educational dreams. However, his\ndecision to help his daughters was his own choice, not a circumstance beyond his\ncontrol. Based on Applicant\u2019s living accommodations that have existed for about 18\nyears, where he pays no mortgage or rent, no utilities or telephone, and given the\nearnings and expense estimates he provided, he currently has at least a $700.00-a-\nmonth remainder. This sizeable remainder could have been used to pay off about six of\nthe past due debts in one payment or a limited number of payments. Payments of some\nof the smaller debts would have interposed more credibility in Applicant\u2019s statement of\nintention to satisfy the creditors. Instead, the little mitigation he does receive under FC\nMC 20.b. is insufficient to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion. \nThe remaining two mitigating conditions are not applicable. FC MC 20.c. \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d is not applicable\nbased on Applicant\u2019 admission he has never had financial counseling. Without financial\ncounseling or indications of control over the problems, FC 20.c. is inapplicable. The\nmost effective way to show control of the problem is through payment of debts. Since\nApplicant has paid none of the creditors, he gets no mitigation under FC MC 20.d. \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved\ndebts.\u201d All factual allegations under the FC guideline are resolved against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at pages 18 and 19 of the AG: \u201c(1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\n\n6\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2c., the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nThe disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the FC guideline have been\nevaluated in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When\nApplicant\u2019s parents came to live with him during his mother\u2019s recuperation, Applicant\nwas 36 years old and living on his employer\u2019s property with no major expenses except\nhis three children. Though it had to be an extra financial burden to take care of his\nparents, their stay was only for a short period. Applicant had plenty of time to readjust\nhis lifestyle to address his creditors. Yet, he did nothing. He furnished no evidence to\neven suggest a constructive change in his financial habits. While he gets credit for\nproviding money to help his two daughters finish school, he should have been\nredirecting these funds toward payment of his overdue debt. Alternatively, he could\nhave applied the monthly remainder to some of the smaller debts in the SOR. Without\nany documented action showing that some of the creditors have been paid or that a\nplan has been set in motion to pay the creditors, Applicant\u2019s current financial difficulties\nwill persist in the future. Applicant has not overcome the adverse evidence under the FC\nguideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                                                 \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn July 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 11, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 22, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nNovember 13, 2008.  The hearing was rescheduled for December 5, 2008 and\nconvened on that date for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application\nfor a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of seven\nJanuary 28, 2009\n\n2\nexhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and eight exhibits.  The transcript\n(R.T.) was received on December 15, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nPrior to the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend sub-\nparagraph 1.a of the SOR to designate the referenced tax lien as a state lien instead of\na federal lien.  Applicant did no object to the amendment, and Department Counsel\u2019s\nmotion to amend was granted.\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented partnership tax lien information and information material to\ncreditor\u2019s 1.g\u2019s default judgment.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 10\ndays to supplement the record.  The Government was afforded two days to respond.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with an explanatory e-mail\ncovering conversations he had with an IRS representative about the tax liability status of\nhis personal and corporate tax liabilities and copies of tax returns filed in behalf of\nhimself and his sons for the tax years of 1995 through 1998.\nApplicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as exhibits I through L.  He followed up\nhis submissions with e-mail accounts of his unsuccessful efforts to enlist the same IRS\nrepresentative to forward a non-collection letter (see ex. M).  He did not produce an IRS\nletter covering the cessation of collection activities against his corporation and/or his\nsole proprietorship, and recounted in a final e-mail that the IRS representative told him\nshe could not send such a letter.  Nor did Applicant provide any documentation of the\ndissolution of his product design corporation.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated (a) IRS tax liens in\nNovember 1998, November 1999, March 2001, and April 2008, respectively, for tax\nyears 1996 through 2003, that exceed $42,000.00 in the aggregate, (b) accumulated\nadditional tax debts with the IRS for tax year 2004, (c) submitted an offer in compromise\nto the IRS in May 2008 for $3,000.00 to settle all federal taxes owed by him and/or his\nbusinesses for tax years 1996 through 2005 (no response to date), (d) a debt with a\nmedical provider for $282.00, and (e) a personal judgment against him in the amount of\n$8,711.16 in February 2007 that is unsatisfied.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to falsified the security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) he completed in February 2006 by (i) omitting IRS liens filed against\nhim when responding to question 27 and (ii) omitting his debts over 180 and 90 days\ndelinquent, respectively, when responding to question 28(a) and (b). \n\n3\nUnder Guideline J, the falsification allegations are incorporated by reference and\ncover the same underlying alleged facts alleged under Guideline E.  The Guideline J\nallegations add a criminal component to Applicant\u2019s alleged e-QIP omissions\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted his federal tax lien of April 2008\nand his still pending offer in compromise, his medical debt, and the judgment entered\nagainst him in February 2007.  He denied the remaining allegations without explanation\nor comment.           \n                                               \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 68-year-old self-employed owner and operator of a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant divorced his wife of 14-years in September 1983 (ex. 1).  He has two\nchildren from this marriage (ages 41 and 39, respectively).  \nApplicant started his original product design company (a graphics design\nbusiness) in 1971.  Around the same time, he founded a temporary personnel company\nto support his product design business,  and ran it for five to six years (to 1976) before\nfolding it into a new product design-personnel company (according to the information he\nfurnished in his e-QIP).  This consolidated enterprise he incorporated in 1981 (R.T., at\n29-30).  Besides his incorporated graphics business, Applicant owns a product design-\npersonnel company, which he started in the late 1990s and operates as a sole\nproprietorship (R.T., at 38).  He was the president and only officer of his now defunct\ncompany (R.T., at 34-38).\nThe founding mission of his product design business was to develop technical\ndata for major defense contractors (see ex. H).  At one time, his company employed 43\nemployees and was a profitable enterprise (earning close to $700,000.00 a year\nbetween 1994 and 1996); it now has no employees and is no longer operational as of\nJanuary 2008 (R.T., at 36-37, 46, 82).  While his product design business does not\nrequire a security clearance in Applicant\u2019s judgment, he has not provided any\ndocumentation of his winding up the corporation\u2019s affairs.  So, whether his product\ndesign corporation is formally dissolved or merely dormant is unknown at this time. \nAtt present, the only one of Applicant\u2019s companies that has a facility security\nclearance is the personnel company he started in the late 1990s and  operates as a\nsole proprietorship (R.T., at 36-42).  The primary mission of his personnel company is to\nplace temporary employees with major defense contractors (R.T., at 43).  Applicant\nreceives no salary from his product design-personnel company, and currently operates\nit out of his garage and home (R.T., at 38).  His company has had a facility security\nclearance from its inception.  His two employees have security clearances (R.T., at 44).\n\n4\nApplicant himself does not have a clearance and does not need one except to satisfy\nthe facility requirements for his company (R.T., at 31-33, 43-44). \nApplicant\u2019s two sons (A and B) have a company that they own and operate\nseparately from Applicant.  Although A and B operate their partnership business out of\nApplicant\u2019s home (R.T., at 95-97), their company has a different name, and they use a\ndifferent zip code for mailing purposes (see exs. I and J; R.T., at 58-60, 97-99).\nBetween 1998 and 2005, Applicant and his sons encountered financial difficulties\nwith their companies.  Records reflect that their state of residence filed a tax lien against\nA/B\u2019s company in November 1998 to cover owed taxes in the amount of $336.00 (see\nexs. A, A-1, B and K).  Neither Applicant nor A/B paid the taxes secured by the lien.\nAnd the lien has not been discharged to date. The IRS filed a tax lien against A/B and\ntheir company in November 1999 to cover taxes owed by A/B and their company in the\namount of $405.34 (see exs. A, A-1, C and L).  This lien remains unsatisfied as well.\nThe IRS filed a lien against Applicant\u2019s product design corporation in March\n2001; this lien covered delinquent taxes totaling $30,992.11 for the inclusive tax years\nof 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 (see exs. 2, D and E).  Applicant never paid the taxes\ncovered by the lien in behalf of his wholly owned corporation, and the lien has not been\nreleased to date.  Records report that Applicant\u2019s corporate business is in debt to the\nIRS for back taxes for the 2004 tax year in the amount of $2,064.18 (see ex. 2; R.T., at\n107).  This tax debt has not been satisfied to date either.  Albeit, it is not included in the\nIRS\u2019 2008 lien (see exs. 2 and E).\nIn April 2008, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant\u2019s sole proprietorship  to\ncover delinquent taxes of $9,687.55 for tax years 1998, 1999, and 2003 (see exs 2 and\nE).  These taxes have not been satisfied to date.\nApplicant attributes the tax problems associated with his company to the\ncontractor \u00a9) who engaged his company in 1996 to work on various projects in his\ncompany\u2019s facility (see ex. H). After generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in\ngross income from work performed for C, C notified Applicant\u2019s company in 1996 of\nnecessitated personnel changes that would reduce his company\u2019s revenue without any\ncorresponding cost reductions (see ex. H; R.T., at 86-87).  Two weeks after notifying\nApplicant\u2019s company of these changes, C terminated its contract with Applicant\u2019s\ncompany (ex. H).  C\u2019s actions imposed serious financial hardships on Applicant\u2019s\ncompany, which did not have the cash on hand to meet tax, payroll, rental and utility\nobligations, and struggled to survive without much financial success (ex. H).  Applicant\nconsidered suing C for contractual breach, but ultimately declined after hearing that he\ncould be risking his life by confronting C and its principals in any court action (see ex. H;\nR.T., at 87).\nApplicant\u2019s financial misfortunes with the operations of his companies were\ncompounded by two physical accidents he suffered between 1998 and march 2001 (see\nex. 2).  The accidents impaired the nerves in his neck and right arm and significantly\n\n5\naffected his ability to operate his graphics business (ex. 2; R.T., at 72-73).  He survived\nfor the ensuing five years on the strength of his disability insurance (R.T., at 73-74). \nHis disability insurance payments ceased in February 2006 when he reached the\nretirement age of 65 (ex. 2; R.T., at 73, 118).  Without an adequate income stream to\nsustain him, he could not meet his personal and business-related  debts.  Applicant\nassures he currently lives within his means with the income he receives from his\ncompany (see ex. 2).\nApplicant submitted a written compromise offer to the IRS in May 2008 (see ex.\n2; R.T., at 90) in the amount of $3,000.00.  His written compromise offer seeks\nsettlement of all taxes owed by himself and his companies for the inclusive tax years of\n1996 through 2005.  His offer does not include any taxes owed by his sons and their\ncompany for any of the covered years.  Moreover, none of the correspondence from the\nIRS attached to his interrogatory responses (ex. 2) make any reference to his sons or\ntheir company.\nApplicant has tried in the past, without success, to reach the responsible IRS\nofficial to ascertain the status of his compromise offer (R.T., at 90-91, 94).  In his most\nrecent discussions with an IRS representative, he assures this IRS representative told\nhim that his personal and corporate tax liabilities were declared uncollectible, and that\nhe would be receiving a letter to that effect (see ex. M).  This same IRS representative\ntold Applicant that she could not send a confirming close-out letter, or discuss his case\nwith anyone outside of her office (see ex. M).  Applicant\u2019s proofs do not include any\ncorrespondence from this IRS representative, or any other IRS official, regarding\nenforcement suspension and/or the agency\u2019s reactions to Applicant\u2019s compromise offer.\nBesides his federal tax debts, Applicant incurred two consumer-related debts that\nwere reported to be delinquent in his credit reports.  Creditor 1.f is a medical debt in the\namount of $282.00.  It is reflected in as delinquent in Applicant\u2019s creditor reports.  While\nthe debt remains outstanding and the subject of ongoing collection activity, medical\nrecords support Applicant\u2019s claims that he is not responsible for the debt (see ex. F). \nHe documents his claims that he bears no personal responsibility for this debt (see ex.\nF; R.T., at 71-72).  His furnished medical documentation does not identify the\nresponsible party that is the subject of collection action (ex. F).   \nApplicant\u2019s other consumer debt (with Creditor 1.g) covers a credit card account\nopened in March 2000 (exs. 3 and 4).  When Applicant fell off a ladder in February\n2001, injured his neck, he encountered recurrent difficulties in meeting his personal and\nbusiness obligations.  A settlement with a local yacht club over a slip and fall incident\nproduced a $70,000.00 settlement for Applicant in 2004 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 124-25).\nWhether and how Applicant used these proceeds to address his debts is unclear.\nRecords show, though, that he stopped making payments altogether on the creditor 1.g\naccount in February 2006 and received a demand letter from the creditor in August\n2006 (ex. F).  When he did not seasonably respond to this creditor\u2019s demand, creditor\n1.g filed suit and obtained a civil default judgment against Applicant for $8,711.16 in\nFebruary 2007 (see exs. 3 and 4; R.T., at 74-75).  This judgment remains outstanding.\n\n6\nApplicant attributes this delinquency and ensuing judgment to health-related\ncircumstances beyond his control.  He fell off a ladder and injured his neck in February\n2001.  The injury required serious neck surgery and extended therapy.  Because of this\ninjury, Applicant was off work for a number of months and fell behind with some of his\ndebts (including his credit card debt with creditor 1.g.  He still considers himself to be\nprimarily disabled.\nWhile Applicant was disabled and recuperating at home, the IRS (in April 2001)\nfiled and notified Applicant of its federal tax lien.  The lien was filed against Applicant\u2019s\ncorporation and served on his P.O. Box, and not against Applicant personally.\nApplicant claims he never checked the post office for any IRS correspondence, and did\nnot know of any IRS lien notice until after he was told of the lien by an interviewing\ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who apprised him of the\nlien in 2006 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 132).  By contrast, the smaller liens filed by the IRS in\n1998 and 1999 (creditors 1.a and 1.b) name his sons and a different P.O. Box number\n(ex. 2). \nIt is clear enough from this record that nothing in either of the identified 1998 and\n1999 lien documents or related tax returns make any reference to Applicant or suggest\nany ownership link between Applicant and the company affiliated with Applicant\u2019s sons\n(compare exs. B and C with J).  The initials of the companies owned by Applicant and\nhis sons, respectively, are identical; their reference on the lien documents identified in\nexhibits B and C provides no helpful guidance.  Applicant\u2019s only explanation for A/B\u2019s\nadoption of the same initials for their company was their perceived desire to take\nadvantage of Applicant\u2019s business reputation and contacts (R.T., at 95). \nKey to differentiating the lien documents covering Applicant\u2019s companies with\nthose of A/B\u2019s company are the names of Applicant\u2019s sons and their zip different codes\nappearing on the lien and underlying tax returns.  Based on the documentation and\ntestimony present, Applicant\u2019s explanations about the coverage of the liens associated\nwith creditors 1.a and 1.b are accepted.  Inferences warrant, accordingly, that the liens\ncovered by creditors 1.a and 1.b cover taxes owed by A/B, and not Applicant.  Applicant\nhas no manifest legal responsibility for the underlying taxes associated with creditors\n1.a and 1.b.  \nAsked to complete his e-QIP in February 2006, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 27 (inquiring about liens placed against his property for failing to pay taxes),\nand question 28(a) and (b) (asking about debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent,\nrespectively).  He attributes his omissions to (a) the lack of any personal responsibility\nfor the tax obligations of his corporation, (b) the lack of knowledge of any tax liens filed\nagainst him, (c) and the absence of any unpaid personal debts (see ex. 2; R.T., at 63-\n72, 80-81, 127-32, 136-38).  In his follow-up interview with an OPM investigator in\nSeptember 2006, he explained the circumstances surrounding his 2001 business-\nrelated tax lien in considerable detail after being shown a copy of the lien by the\ninvestigator (see ex. 2).  Because of the close association of Applicant\u2019s company and\nhimself, typical separation between an owner and his company is complicated. \n\n7\nTo the extent the IRS recognizes the personal and corporate legal distinctions in\nthe exchanges Applicant recites in his post-hearing e-mail submissions, treatment of\nApplicant and his company as a unitary association for tax and E-QIP reporting is not\njustified.  It may well be that Applicant and his company should be treated as a unitary\nentity, but the evidence is not sufficiently developed in this record to make this case.\nQuestion 28 of Applicant\u2019s e-QIP asks financially related questions about Applicant in a\npersonal way and provides no expansive definitions of the term \u201cyour\u201d that could\nsuggest inclusion of Applicant\u2019s corporate interests.  His explanations regarding his\nomission of his corporation\u2019s tax lien are accepted. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s omissions of his personal tax deficiencies for tax years\n1998, 1999 and 2003 (covered by subparagraph 1.e) do not involve any semantical\ndistinctions between corporate and personal debts.  These underlying tax debts were\nclearly treated by the IRS as his personal debts based on the identifying information\nsupplied in the covered 2008 lien and Applicant\u2019s own testimony about the sole\nproprietorship he established in the late 1990s. \nBecause the tax lien covering Applicant\u2019s personal taxes was not filed until April\n2008, this lien was not covered by question 27 of the e-QIP he completed earlier.  The\nunderlying taxes, though, were in delinquent status, and are covered as omissions in\nsub-paragraphs 2.b and 2.c.  It is certainly reasonable to believe that the IRS provided\nApplicant with regular late notices about his underlying personal tax deficiencies.\nHowever, there is no developed documentary paper trail of notices, or Applicant\nacknowledgments of notice receipts, to forge the basis for any hard findings.\nWithout substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s receiving regular late notices from the\nIRS concerning his personal tax deficiencies, no fair inferences can be drawn that he\ndeliberately omitted these delinquent tax debts that covered in the IRS\u2019s 2008 tax lien.\nLikewise, the ownership relationship of Applicant to his sons\u2019 company is not sufficiently\ndeveloped to warrant inferences that his personal interests are unitary with A/B\u2019s\ncompany. \nSo, as to alleged omissions that Applicant deliberately omitted the tax liens\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a, 1b, and the underlying taxes covered by sub-paragraph\n1.e, favorable inferences warrant, too, but for different reasons.  Here, the proofs are\ninsufficient to establish that Applicant (a) had any ownership interest in A/Bs\u2019s\npartnership and/or that he (b) was made aware of debt deficiencies relative to his sole\nproprietorship. \nThe SOR also alleges that Applicant omitted his medical debt (creditor 1.f) from\n28b (inquiring about debts over 90 days delinquent).  Applicant attributes his failure to\nlist his medical debt to his claimed lack of any monies owed to the creditor 1.f (see ex.\nF; R.T., at 116).  Applicant\u2019s claims of unintentional omission are corroborated by the\ndocumentation presented by the Government (see ex. 2) and Applicant to a more\nlimited degree (see ex. F, showing a zero balance attributable to Applicant personally). \n\n8\nAddressing Applicant\u2019s credit card account with creditor 1.g (the judgment\ncreditor), Applicant informs that he simply misunderstood the status of his ongoing\nnegotiations with the creditor at the time over setting up a new payment plan (R.T., at\n118-19).  Applicant\u2019s explanations lack relevant specifics but suggest some Applicant\nconfusion. The August 2008 demand letter he received from creditor 1.g recites only a\nfive month past due history (see ex. F).  So, it is quite plausible that he had some\nmemory confusion over just when this account became over 180 and/or 90 days\ndelinquent.  In any case, omission of the underlying debt is not alleged in the SOR,\nthough, and no inferences need be drawn on whether or not Applicant should have\nlisted this debt when responding to question 28 of his e-QIP.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts.\u201d Adjudication Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n9\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 30.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is the president and chief operating officer of two small defense\ncontractors (one incorporated and the other operated as a sole proprietorship) he has\nowned and operated since his founding of the companies (in 1976 and 1998,\nrespectively).  Over the course of an eight-year period, Applicant\u2019s companies failed to\npay owed federal income taxes. The IRS filed two tax liens against his companies and\ntwo smaller ones against a company owned by his sons (A/B) that remain unpaid and\nunsatisfied.  His corporation is liable as well for assessed taxes for the tax year of 2004.\nAdditionally, a consumer credit card company took a default judgment against him in\n\n10\nFebruary 2007 for $8,711.16. This judgment remains unpaid and unsatisfied.\nConsidered together, and without resolution, the recurrent tax liens and debts associated\nwith Applicant and his company, and the still outstanding civil judgment entered against\nhim raise security significant concerns.  Initial security concerns were also raised against\nApplicant\u2019s omissions of federal tax liens and his delinquent debts.      \nApplicant\u2019s finances                                                                  \nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide\nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of federal\ntax liens through the small company he owns and manages, his outstanding judgment\nindebtedness, and his past inability to pay  these debts warrant the application of two of\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: DC 19(a)\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC 19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to recurrent income shortages following\ncontract terminations and other business related short-falls with his companies and\npersonal finances.  To date, he has not been able to effectuate a compromise settlement\nwith the IRS on owed taxes by both of his companies, and the IRS has reportedly\ndeclared these debts uncollectible.  Applicant provides no documentation of this reported\nuncollectible status, or whether the IRS\u2019 reported decision covers his companies and\nhimself.  Without any documented dissolution of the corporate enterprise he claims to\nhave shuttered in 2008, ascertainment of IRS enforcement intentions cannot be made\nwithout considerable speculation.  \nApplicant does not provide adequate explanations either as to why he has not\nmade more concerted earlier attempts to work out payment arrangements with the IRS.\nNor has he provided any convincing justifications for failing to make any concerted\nattempts  to resolve the outstanding judgment against him. \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has initiated little follow-up efforts to resolve\nthe outstanding tax liens covering his product design corporation (reportedly no longer\noperational) and personnel proprietorship he owns and maintains. Afforded an\nopportunity to consummate compromise arrangements with the IRS on all of the owed\ntaxes by his corporation and his sole proprietorship, he has not been able to engage the\nIRS in any tangible settlement discussions, much less obtain approval of his still pending\ncompromise offer.  Prospects for reaching any compromise accord with the IRS are less\npromising in the face of the latest information furnished Applicant by the IRS\nrepresentative who spoke with him. \n\n11\nMitigation credit to Applicant is very limited based on his furnished proofs. True,\ntwo of the documented state/federal tax liens (associated with creditors 1.a and 1.b)\ninvolve tax deficiencies covered by a company owned by Applicant\u2019s two sons and have\nno tangible legal connection with Applicant. Applicant was careful in his May 2008\ncompromise offer to limit the coverage of his compromise to federal taxes owed the IRS\nby himself and his own graphics design and personnel businesses. \nHowever, the remaining tax and consumer debts belong to Applicant. The\ncorporate taxes covered by the IRS\u2019s March 2001 lien were accrued over a five-year\nperiod spanning 1996 and 2000, and involve a company wholly owned and operated by\nApplicant.  As his company\u2019s owner and president he was responsible for making sure\nthat the corporation\u2019s taxes were timely paid.  He acknowledged as much in his\ncompromise offer which covers all federal taxes owed by himself, his sole proprietorship,\nand his corporate business.  Of all of the proven debts listed in the SOR, he is only able\nto document resolution (by way of release of any liability he might have) of the small\nmedical debt covered by subparagraph 1.f of the SOR. \nAccordingly, the tax debts and judgment debt linked to Applicant exclusively in the\nSOR through his identified graphics design corporation and personnel business remain\nhis legal obligation and responsibility, even if the IRS considers the underlying taxes no\nlonger collectible.  And at this time, the IRS has not provided any documentary proof to\nApplicant that it is no longer looking to enforcement of back taxes associated with\nhimself and his companies. The same holds true with the judgment debt identified in\nsubparagraph 1.g.  As a result, MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied\nto Applicant\u2019 situation.  \u00b6 MC 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some limited applicability based on\nApplicant\u2019s documented payment of his creditor 1.f medical debt and satisfactory proofs\nthat the tax debts covered by subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b are not his obligations or\nresponsibilities.  \n                                                       \nBecause Applicant has not chosen to seek any counseling advice relative to his\nidentified tax and judgment debts, he may take only limited advantage of \u00b6 MC 20\u00a9),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  While there is some\nreason to anticipate future resolution of his federal tax issues based on his documented\nwritten compromise, he has produced no tangible progress with the IRS to date.  Nor\ndoes he provide any tangible evidence of repayment efforts with the consumer judgment\nholder covered in the SOR.  Considered together, Applicant\u2019s efforts are not enough to\nwarrant any more than partial application of \u00b6 MC 20\u00a9).  \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\n\n12\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not help Applicant to overcome the judgment\nlapses associated with his tax debt accumulations and consumer judgment concerns.\nHis long work history in providing contact support for other defense contractors is\ncommendable and deserving of public praise.  His failure, though, to diligently monitor\nand ensure timely tax payments to the IRS in connection with his corporate and personal\nbusinesses reflects the lack of adequate attention to his fiducial duties of meeting his\ncompanies\u2019 tax obligations.  His efforts to compromise these accrued tax debts (most of\nwhich are  covered by still outstanding tax liens) have been unsuccessful to date and\npreclude him from mitigating security concerns over his ability to achieve and maintain\nstable finances for both himself and his defense-related business enterprises.  These\nconcerns are not mitigated under the whole person concept.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, his earnest but still mostly unsuccessful steps to resolve them, and\nthe absence of sufficient efforts to demonstrate his financial responsibility and\ntrustworthiness in managing his finances, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns\nrelated to his proven debt delinquencies.  While Applicant is to be commended and\nencouraged in his repayment efforts, more tangible proofs of success are necessary to\nsatisfy minimum standards of security eligibility.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by sub-paragraphs 1.c through 1.e and 1.g of the\nSOR.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b and 1.f.\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nPosing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant\u2019s documented omitted tax\nliens and delinquent debts in the e-QIP he completed in February 2006.  He attributed\nhis omissions to (a) the lack of any personal responsibility for the tax obligations of his\ncorporation, (b) the lack of knowledge of any tax liens or underlying taxes assessed or\nfiled against him, and \u00a9) the absence of any unpaid personal debts.  His claims have\nmerit. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant presents as an essentially honest\napplicant who experienced mostly business-related losses and ensuing tax liens and\npersuaded he did not deliberately omit the corporate tax lien filed against him and his\ncompany in March 2001. His e-QIP omissions appear to be isolated mistakes and the\nsource of misunderstandings, and are not indicative of any overall trust problem. \nApplicant\u2019s accepted explanations enable him to persuasively demonstrate that\nhis omissions (if they can be characterized as omissions) were inadvertent, based on the\ncorporate nature of the 2001 tax lien against his company and his lack of any personal\nknowledge, or reasons to believe otherwise, that question 28 of his e-QIP covered not\njust personal liens, but corporations in which the applicant had a material interest.  \n\n13\nBased on Applicant\u2019s stated understanding of the financial questions in the e-QIP\nand his accepted claims he the lien was not his personally, the lack of any documented\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s notification of personal taxes owed, and his accepted assurances\nthat his medical debt had already been paid (the only cognizable claims covered by\nGuideline E of the SOR), Applicant is able to successfully refute the allegations of\nfalsification in the SOR.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by Guidelines E and J.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a, 1.b and 1.f:\nFOR APPLICANT    \nSub-paras. 1.c, through 1.e and 1.g\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE C: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a through 2.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact As to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations of illegal drug use in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c. He also admitted using drugs while holding a security clearance, SOR \u00b6 2.a, and admitted his answers to questions on his security clearance applications concerning drug use were incorrect as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2. However, he said he misinterpreted the questions. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 38-year-old software engineer.5 In 1995 he received a masters degree in electrical engineering. He has no military service. He has never married and has no children. He has been employed for the last 17 years primarily as an electrical or software engineer. Drug Use6 Applicant used marijuana from 1985 to 1994 about twice a month, and from 1994 to December 2003, he used marijuana about three-to-four times per year. He purchased the marijuana on about half of the occasions that he used it. He used cocaine about five times from 1989 to August 2003. He purchased and used hallucinogenic mushrooms about five times from 1989 to 1997. He purchased and used LSD7 about five times from 1987 to 1993. He purchased and used \u201cwhippets\u201d8 twice, and used \u201cwhippets\u201d an additional eight times without purchasing it from 1991 to 1995. 5Item 4 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing ",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security concerns under \n \n1Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Oct. 30, 2007). Item I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nMarch 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nGuidelines H (Drug Involvement), E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue his security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on November 21, 2007, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated December 11, 2007, was provided to him on \nJanuary 3, 2008, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nFebruary 2, 2008. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to \nme on March 13, 2008. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested amendment of the SOR to add an allegation that \nvarious false statements on security clearance applications and to a National Security \nAgency (NSA) investigator violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (FORM at 2-3) in addition to being \na Guideline E security concern as articulated in SOR \u00b6 2. My copy of the SOR includes \nthe requested amendment (Item 1 at SOR \u00b6 3.a). Applicant did not object to the \namendment, and the amendment is approved.  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered supporting documents to show that Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions concerning the use of \u201cwhippets\u201d involved inhalants (Items 10 and 11). \nApplicant did not object to admission of Items 10 and 11. Items 10 and 11 are admitted. \nI will take administrative notice4 of the information concerning use of whippets in note 8, \ninfra.   \n \n \n \n \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Dec. 14, 2007; \nhowever, Applicant\u2019s receipt is signed, and dated January 3, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n4Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen \ntypes of facts for administrative notice).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted in his response to the \nSOR all of the SOR\u2019s allegations of illegal drug use in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c. He also \nadmitted using drugs while holding a security clearance, SOR \u00b6 2.a, and admitted his \nanswers to questions on his security clearance applications concerning drug use were \nincorrect as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2. However, he said he misinterpreted the questions. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old software engineer.5 In 1995 he received a masters \ndegree in electrical engineering. He has no military service. He has never married and \nhas no children. He has been employed for the last 17 years primarily as an electrical or \nsoftware engineer.      \n \nDrug Use6 \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1985 to 1994 about twice a month, and from 1994 \nto December 2003, he used marijuana about three-to-four times per year. He purchased \nthe marijuana on about half of the occasions that he used it. He used cocaine about five \ntimes from 1989 to August 2003. He purchased and used hallucinogenic mushrooms \nabout five times from 1989 to 1997. He purchased and used LSD7 about five times from \n1987 to 1993. He purchased and used \u201cwhippets\u201d8 twice, and used \u201cwhippets\u201d an \nadditional eight times without purchasing it from 1991 to 1995.  \n \n \n5Item 4 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), dated July 13, 2006, will \nbe referred to as a security clearance application in this decision) is the source for the facts in this \nparagraph, unless otherwise stated.  \n \n6 Applicant admitted the drug use in this section to a representative of the Associate Directorate \nfor Security and Counterintelligence (ADS&CI) on March 18, 2004. See Item 9 at 2, 11. On November 21, \n2007, he reaffirmed the drug use as described to the ADS&CI representative. See Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR). Item 9 at 2, 11 and Item 2 are the sources for the facts in the Drug Use subsection \nof this decision, unless stated otherwise.  \n  \n7 Lysergic acid diethylamide is also commonly known as \u201cLSD.\u201d See Kimbrough v. United States, \n128 S. Ct. 558 (2007). LSD is classified as a Schedule I drug in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970.  \nLSD is a potent hallucinogenic substance. See Drug Enforcement Administration website (Available at:   \nhttp://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/dea/product/lsd/lsd-4.htm .) \n \n8Abuse of inhalants, such as nitrous oxide, is also referred to as use of \u201cwhippets,\u201d and such use \nmay, \u201ccause a person to have slurred speech, difficulty maintaining balance, be slow to respond to \nquestions, noises and speech, be immune to pain, and lapse into unconsciousness.\u201d See, e.g., Peschko \nv. City of Camden, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 43871 (D.C. N.J. 2006).  See also Items 10 (Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, Drugs of Abuse Extract, Chapter 9 (Inhalants) and 11 (National Institute of Drug Abuse, \nInfoFacts \u2013 Inhalants, dated May 2006).  The particular chemical Applicant inhaled is not included in the \nrecord. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant held a Secret clearance from December 1991 until 1997 while \nemployed by the U.S. Army. He held a Top Secret clearance with access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) from May 1997 to March 2000, while employed by a \ndefense contractor. See Applicant\u2019s Response to SOR \u00b6 1.c.  \n \nFalsification of Security Clearance Applications and 2003 NSA Interview \n    \n \nApplicant responded, \u201cNo\u201d and failed to disclose or fully disclose his illegal drug \npossession and/or use in response to the following questions on his security clearance \napplications in 1991, 1996, 2003 and 2004: \n \nQuestion 25 of his application dated October 7, 1991, (Item 5) asked: \n \n25. Illegal Drugs and Alcohol--a. In the last 5 years, have you used, \npossessed, supplied, or manufactured any illegal drugs? When used \nwithout a prescription, illegal drugs include marijuana, cocaine, . . .  \nhallucinogenics (LSD . . . ), [or] stimulants (cocaine . . . ) (NOTE: The \ninformation you provide in response to this question will not be provided \nfor use in any criminal proceedings against you.) (Emphasis in original).  \n \nQuestions 24a and 24b of his application of December 5, 1996, (Item 6) asked: \n \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity \nYou are required to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your \nfailure to do so could be grounds for an adverse employment decision or \naction against you, but neither your truthful responses nor information \nderived from your responses will be used as evidence against you in any \nsubsequent criminal proceeding.   \n \na. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have \nyou illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, \ncocaine, crack cocaine, . . . [or] hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.)? \n \nb. Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance .  .  .  while \npossessing a security clearance . . . ?  \n \nQuestions 27 and 28 of his applications dated February 2, 2003, and March 18, \n2004, (Item 7) asked: \n \n27. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity-Illegal Use of Drugs. \nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you \nillegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, \ncrack cocaine, . . . [or] hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), . . . ? \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n28. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity-Use in Sensitive \nPositions Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while . . . \nwhile possessing a security clearance . . . ? \n \nFor Question 24 of his application dated May 4, 2006, and on July 13, 2006, \n(Item 4) he responded, \"Yes\" and disclosed his marijuana use from July 2000 \n(estimated) to December 2002, approximately once every two months. Question 24 \nasked for illegal drug use for other drugs in addition to marijuana: \n \n24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity a. Since the age of 16 or in \nthe last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any \ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, . . . \nhallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.)? \n \nDuring an interview with a National Security Agency (NSA) Investigator on \nSeptember 3, 2003, as part of a background investigation pertaining to his eligibility for \naccess to SCI information, Applicant denied any prior illegal drug use.9 On July 7, 2004, \nthe NSA denied his request for eligibility for access to SCI information. On August 2, \n2004, and September 6, 2004, he appealed the NSA\u2019s unfavorable determination. \nHowever, his appeals were subsequently denied.  \n \nOn January 10, 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant, and he disclosed that he used marijuana from 2000 to 2002 \napproximately once every two months with two friends, who were named in the \ninterview.10 He said he ended his drug use in 2002.  Although he did not disclose the \nextent and variety of his drug abuse in the 2007 OPM interview, the summary is unclear \nabout whether he was specifically asked about non-marijuana drug use, and marijuana \nuse with others after 2002.     \n  \nOn November 21, 2007, Applicant said that he did not disclose his illegal drug \nuse because his interpretation at the time he completed his security clearance \napplications was that \u201cusing the listed substances in rare recreational circumstances \nwas not what I constituted (sic) as \u2018use.\u2019 The most important lesson is that, although a \nmisinterpretation, I now realize the lack of consideration of my activities and accuracy of \nthe answers from the beginning inevitably cast doubt and the appearance of \nfalsification.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n9 Item 2 at 3, 5; Item 9 (NSA Clearance Adjudication, July 7, 2004) at 2 is the source for the facts \nin this paragraph.  \n \n10 Item 8 at 4-5 is the source for the facts in this paragraph. He affirmed the accuracy of the OPM \ninterview (as summarized in the OPM Report of Investigation) in his response to a DOHA interrogatory on \nAug. 9, 2007. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d11 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).12 \n \n11 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something \nless than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n12 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) \n \nGuideline \u00b6 24 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning drug13 \ninvolvement stating: \n \n[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThree drug involvement disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d14 \u201cillegal drug possession,\u201d and \n \n13Guideline \u00b6 24(a) defines \u201cdrugs\u201d as substances that alter mood and behavior, including: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana and LSD are Schedule I controlled substances. See Sch. I (c)(9) and I(c)(10), \nrespectively.  See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on \nSchedule I). Cocaine is a Schedule II controlled substance.  See Sch. II(a)(4).   \n \n14 Guideline \u00b6 24(b) defines \u201cdrug abuse\u201d as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n\u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). The other five disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 25 are not applicable.  These \nthree disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant used a variety of illegal drugs \nfrom 1985 to December 2003, including marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, \nLSD and whippets. He used each of these illegal drugs at least once while holding a \nsecurity clearance. His illegal drug use breached the government\u2019s trust encompassed \nby holding a security clearance and raises especially serious security concerns. \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these three disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. AG \u00b6 26 provides for potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance \nfor any violation. \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated based on AG \u00b6 26(a) by showing that the \ndrug offenses happened so long ago, were so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that they are unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for \ndetermining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d  ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d15 \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s last illegal drug use was in \nDecember 2003, which is still sufficiently recent to remain a concern. His overall illegal \ndrug use lasted approximately 18 years, and involved numerous uses of marijuana, and \nseveral other illegal drugs with a much lesser frequency.16 I am not fully convinced that \nhe ended his drug use in December 2003 because he did not provide any corroboration \nthat his drug use ended.17 His failure to present corroboration about his rehabilitation \nfrom medical/psychiatric personnel, co-workers, neighbors, family or friends is a factor \nin this decision.18 Based on all the facts and circumstances, including the falsifications \n \n15 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing.  The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy.  For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe Administrative Judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an Administrative Judge stating: \n \nThe Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history \nof improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the \nsecurity clearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times \na year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the \nillegal purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n16 In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an \nunfavorable security clearance decision because the Administrative Judge failed to explain why drug use \nwas not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse.  \n \n17 See whole person analysis, infra. See ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2, 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, \n2006) (indicating when a mitigating condition cannot be fully applied, \u201csome credit\u201d is still available under \nthat same mitigating condition). \n \n18Administrative judges \u201cmust look at the record for corroboration of Applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d ISCR \nCase 02-03186 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006). Moreover, a judge may consider \u201cApplicant\u2019s failure to \npresent documentary evidence in corroboration of his denials and explanations.\u201d ISCR Case 01-20579 at \n5 (App. Bd. Apr. 14, 2004) (holding Applicant\u2019s failure to provide reasonably available corroborative \nevidence may be used in common sense evaluation to determine whether Applicant\u2019s claims are \nestablished). In ISCR Case 01-02677 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, 2002), the Appeal Board explained: \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nof his security clearance applications, his less than full candor in his 2003 NSA \ninterview, and his 2007 less-than-credible explanation in his response to the SOR \nconcerning the security clearance falsifications, he has not met his burden of \nestablishing that his drug use will not recur. Because he may again use illegal drugs, his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment is not completely restored.   \nAG \u00b6 26(b) lists four ways Applicant can demonstrate his intent not to abuse \nillegal drugs in the future. Although he has abstained from drug abuse since December \n2003, he did not provide \u201ca signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 26(b) is not applicable.  \nAG \u00b6 26(c) is not applicable because his abuse of marijuana did not follow an \nillness, and marijuana was never prescribed for him. AG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable \nbecause he has not completed a prescribed drug treatment program, and there has not \nbeen a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.  \nIn sum, Applicant ended his drug abuse in December 2003. However, his \ncredibility about abstaining from illegal drug use is damaged by his submission of \nmultiple falsified security clearance applications. He lied in his 2003 NSA interview. \nAlthough the motivations to stop using drugs are evident,19 he did not disclose any \ninternal motivation to refrain from drug abuse. He has not shown or demonstrated a \nsufficient track record of no drug abuse.   \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \n \nWhile lack of corroboration can be a factor in evaluating the reliability or weight of \nevidence, lack of corroboration does not automatically render a piece of evidence \nsuspect, unreliable, or incredible. . . . Evidence that lacks corroboration must be \nevaluated in terms of its intrinsic believability and in light of all the other evidence of \nrecord, including evidence that tends to support it as well as evidence that tends to \ndetract from it.   \n \n19Retention of a security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong motivations for \nremaining drug free.  \n  \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose or fully disclose his illegal drug possession and/or use \non his security clearance applications in 1991, 1996, 2003, 2004, and 2006. He falsely \ndenied illegal drug use during a 2003 NSA interview. In 2007, his claimed rationale in \nhis SOR response for providing false statements on his security clearance applications \nwas because his drug use was \u201cin rare recreational circumstances\u201d and not what he \nconsidered to be drug \u201cuse.\u201d  He has held a security clearance for many years, and has \na masters degree. He is intelligent, well educated, and mature. His explanation is not \ncredible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his \nsecurity clearance application on July 13, 2006, is recent.20 He did not promptly inform \nthe government of the falsification. He attempted to mislead a security investigation. He \ndid not receive counseling designed to improve his conduct.  Applicant\u2019s claim that his \nillegal drug use was recreational and therefore not reportable to security officials is not \ncredible. No one advised him to falsify his security clearance applications or to lie to a \nNSA investigator. He admitted the false statements at issue, and the falsification \nallegations are all substantiated. His statement that he learned from his mistakes does \nnot convince me that similar misbehavior is unlikely to recur. His falsifications cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Security concerns \npertaining to his personal conduct are not mitigated. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d  SOR \u00b6 3.a alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 \nby falsifying his security clearance applications in 1991, 1996, 2003, 2004, and 2006. \nApplicant deliberately provided false information. He falsely denied illegal drug use \nduring a 2003 NSA interview.   \n \nFor a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. \nThe Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 \n \n20 The falsifications cannot be considered in isolation or piecemeal. The Judge is required to \nevaluate the record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of his \nconduct. ISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When the falsifications are considered in connection with the falsifications, the \npersonal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2 cannot be mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c). His misconduct continues to cast \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(1995): as a statement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of \ninfluencing, the decision making body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States \nv. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nIf Applicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance \napplications, his accurate answers are capable of influencing the government to deny \nhis security clearance, as indicated in the Drug Involvement section of this Analysis. \nHis illegal drug use is sufficiently recent and serious21 to jeopardize approval of his \nsecurity clearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, \na felony (the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a \n$10,000 fine). Accordingly, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply because Applicant violated 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \u2013 31(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s false statement occurred on his \n2006 security clearance application, which is recent. It casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced \ninto making his false statements. His expression that he has learned from his mistake is \nundercut by his incredible explanation in his SOR response that he did not believe his \ndrug use was really drug use. He admitted making the false statements, and for the \nreasons stated previously, the offense is substantiated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n21 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nApplicant earned a masters degree in electrical engineering. He has been \nemployed for the last 17 years primarily as an electrical or software engineer, working \nfor the U.S. Army and government contractor. His record of good employment (aside \nfrom falsifying his security clearance applications and lying to an NSA investigator) \nweighs in his favor. This shows some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant used a variety of illegal drugs from 1985 to December 2003, including \nmarijuana, cocaine, hallucinogenic mushrooms, LSD and whippets. He used each of \nthese illegal drugs at least once while holding a security clearance. He failed to fully \ndisclose his illegal drug possession and/or use on his security clearance applications in \n1991, 1996, 2003, 2004, and 2006, and during a 2003 NSA interview. His decisions not \nto fully disclose his drug use were deliberate and intentional. His falsifications and drug \nuse were knowledgeable, voluntary, and not isolated. He was sufficiently mature to be \nfully responsible for his conduct. Criminal misbehavior and drug use is not prudent or \nresponsible. His falsification of his 2006 security clearance is particularly aggravating, \nand weighs most heavily against granting or continuing his security clearance. He did \nnot receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear understanding about how \nto avoid problematic situations and why he engaged in the misconduct. I have persistent \nand serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal misconduct calls into question his current ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug \ninvolvement, personal conduct and criminal conduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d22 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \n \n22See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a(1) to 1.a(5):  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b(1) to 1.b(4):  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c(1) to 1.c(2):  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the allegations. At the hearing, he admitted the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and his admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 63-year-old mechanical engineer. He has held a security clearance since August 1967. He received a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering in 1980 and worked for a defense contractor until December 1998. He formed his own company in February 1999 and works as a consultant to defense contractors in the field of underwater acoustics (Tr. 166). He is the president and sole owner of his company. He also is the Information System Security Manager (ISSM) and the Facility Security Officer (FSO). His daughter is the corporate secretary and his brother is the chairman of the board (Tr. 174). Applicant requested a facility security clearance in October 1999, and his company was granted a clearance in September 2000. The cognizant security agency (CSA) for Applicant\u2019s company is the Defense Security Service (DSS), as executive 3 agent for the Department of Defense (Tr. 47). A DSS industrial security representative (ISR) conducted a security inspection of the facility in December 2000, and Applicant received an updated copy of Chapter 8 of the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) from DSS in February 2001 (AX W). The ISR acts for DSS in interpreting the NISPOM (Tr. 47). Applicant\u2019s ISR testified he and Applicant had an",

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 18, \n2002. On August 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny \nhis application, citing security concerns under Guidelines K and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJune 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 27, 2007; answered it on \nSeptember 14, 2007; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on September 19, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on December 31, 2007, and the case was assigned to me on January 2, 2008. \nThe case was tentatively scheduled for February 29, 2008. Applicant retained a lawyer, \nwho entered his appearance on January 29, 2008, and requested that the hearing be \npostponed until March 2008. His entry of appearance and request for a postponement \nare attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX I).  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 27, 2008, scheduling the hearing for \nApril 24, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 28 were admitted in evidence without objection. The testimony of one \ngovernment witness was taken by video-teleconference (VTC), and two government \nwitnesses testified in person at the hearing. Department Counsel\u2019s request to present \nthe testimony of one witness by VTC is attached to the record as HX II. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through Z, which \nwere admitted without objection.  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until May 9, 2008, to \nenable him to submit additional documentary evidence.  Applicant timely submitted AX \nAA through DD, and they were admitted without objection. I granted requests from \ncounsel for both sides to submit written closing statements. Department Counsel\u2019s \nwritten closing statement is attached to the record as HX III, and Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s \nclosing statement is HX IV. The record closed on May 9, 2008. DOHA received the \ntranscripts of the VTC testimony and the hearing (Tr.) on May 15, 2008. The VTC \ntestimony is in a separate transcript marked \u201cVTC Transcript.\u201d  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all the allegations. At the hearing, he \nadmitted the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and his admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old mechanical engineer. He has held a security clearance \nsince August 1967. He received a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering in 1980 and worked \nfor a defense contractor until December 1998. He formed his own company in February \n1999 and works as a consultant to defense contractors in the field of underwater \nacoustics (Tr. 166). He is the president and sole owner of his company. He also is the \nInformation System Security Manager (ISSM) and the Facility Security Officer (FSO). \nHis daughter is the corporate secretary and his brother is the chairman of the board (Tr. \n174). \n \n \nApplicant requested a facility security clearance in October 1999, and his \ncompany was granted a clearance in September 2000. The cognizant security agency \n(CSA) for Applicant\u2019s company is the Defense Security Service (DSS), as executive \n\n \n3 \n \n \nagent for the Department of Defense (Tr. 47). A DSS industrial security representative \n(ISR) conducted a security inspection of the facility in December 2000, and Applicant \nreceived an updated copy of Chapter 8 of the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM) from DSS in February 2001 (AX W). The ISR acts for DSS \nin interpreting the NISPOM (Tr. 47). \n \nApplicant\u2019s ISR testified he and Applicant had an open, cooperative, and cordial \nrelationship (Tr. 73). He testified that establishing an information system (IS) for the first \ntime in a small organization can be \u201cfairly daunting,\u201d but Applicant was receptive to \nadvice (Tr. 76). The ISR had complained to his supervisors on \u201cmore than one \noccasion\u201d about the difficulty of monitoring a company where the president, owner, \nfacility security officer, and information security manager were the same person (Tr. \n113). \n \nThe ISR normally corresponds by email. He works a normal 5-day week, and his \nworkday ends at 4:30. His Blackberry shuts off at 4:30. He responds to emails received \nafter 4:30 during the next duty day (Tr. 101-02). \n \nApplicant\u2019s company received interim accreditation for processing classified \ninformation in September 2001 (AX L). After a number of discussions with his ISR and \nseveral modifications of his company\u2019s draft Information System Security Plan (ISSP), \nhis ISSP dated December 4, 2001, was approved and fully accredited by DSS on \nJanuary 17, 2002 (GX 7; GX 21; AX M; Tr. 172). Although Applicant held a clearance \nfor many years, this was his first experience developing an ISSP (Tr. 172). \n \nThe ISSP recites that it was written in accordance with the NISPOM, Industrial \nSecurity Letter (ISL) 00L-2, and ISL 01L-1 (GX 7 at \u00b6 1.1). ISL 01L requires that DSS be \nnotified before any changes to an ISSP are implemented so a reaccreditation decision \ncan be made. It also requires that classified processing be in an area where authorized \ncontractor personnel can exercise constant surveillance and control. It must have an \u201can \nidentifiable boundary (e.g., walls, signs, tape on floor, rope or chains) where it is \nobvious that the area is restricted to only authorized personnel.\u201d The \u201cidentifiable \nboundary\u201d for Applicant\u2019s information system (IS) was the living room of his home, \nwhere he lives alone (Tr. 43).  \n \nThe ISSP designated Applicant as the ISSM and stated: \u201cManagement assures \nthat the ISSM is trained to a level commensurate with the complexity of the facility\u2019s \n[information system]. In this role, the ISSM shall carry out all duties as outlined in \nSection 8, 103 of the NISPOM.\u201d (GX 7 at \u00b6 2.2.) The NISPOM \u00b6 8-103b states that the \nISSM \u201c[e]stablishes, documents, implements, and monitors the IS Security Program and \nrelated procedures for the facility and ensures facility compliance with requirements for \nIS.\u201d The letter from DSS approving the ISSP reminded Applicant of his responsibility as \nISSM \u201cto ensure that any change in configuration, mode of operation or other \nmodification is analyzed to determine its impact and to take appropriate action, including \nnotification of this office, in order to maintain a level of security consistent with the \nrequirements for this accreditation.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe ISSP \u201cHardware Baseline\u201d listed one laptop computer, a monitor, two \nprinters, and two disk drives (GX 8, Attachment 3). Applicant used the laptop for both \nclassified and unclassified processing by switching removable hard drives (Tr. 177). \n \n \nOn November 20, 2002, Applicant completed an on-line course of instruction \nfrom the DSS Academy entitled \u201cEssentials of Industrial Security Management\u201d (AX A). \nOn December 1, 2002, he completed an on-line DSS course entitled \u201cProtecting Secret \nand Confidential Documents\u201d (AX B). He enrolled in a resident DSS course entitled \n\u201cFSO Program Management\u201d in February 2003 but did not attend the course because it \nconflicted with a scheduled briefing for a project (AX D; Tr. 175). He completed the \n\u201cFSO Program Management\u201d course in July 2003. \n \n \nOn Sunday, February 16, 2003, Applicant traveled across the country from his \nhome to give a four-hour classified presentation to a defense contractor. He had \nprepared the presentation in his home office, the designated site in his ISSP (Tr. 180). \nThe host contractor had agreed to provide a classified computer for the presentation \n(Tr. 181). However, on the evening of Friday, February 14, 2003, Applicant was \ninformed by the host contractor\u2019s security representative that he had been unable to \nobtain a computer for the presentation, and Applicant offered to use his computer in a \nclassified mode if they could not find a suitable computer at the site of the presentation \n(Tr. 182).  \n \nApplicant traveled to the site of the presentation with his laptop computer, a \nclassified hard drive, and a compact disc classified SECRET. He arrived late at night \nand stored the classified hard drive and classified compact disc in a safe at the host \ncontractor\u2019s security office (AX BB). He kept his laptop in his possession, because there \nwas insufficient space for it in the safe. He testified he did not think it was necessary to \nstore the laptop in the safe because the classified hard drive had been removed and his \nlaptop had several security seals on it (GX 12 at 3-4).  \n \n \nApplicant testified he believed the restrictions on removal of hardware in the \nISSP applied only to doing classified processing outside his approved work space in his \noffice (Tr. 183). He had taken his computer off-site on other occasions, but only with the \nshell of the computer and the unclassified hard drive. He would follow the downgrade \nprocedure in his ISSP, remove the classified drive, and record the downgrade in a log \n(Tr. 185). The trip in February 2003 was the first time he had taken his laptop off-site to \ndo classified work. He testified he did not contact his ISR for permission because he did \nnot think it was necessary (Tr. 186). He also testified he did not contact his ISR for \npermission to bring classified material to the host-contractor\u2019s site because he did not \nthink it was required (Tr. 188). In his capacity as FSO, he signed the courier letter \nauthorizing him to hand-carry the classified material to the host contractor\u2019s site (AX \nAA). \n \nOn Monday, February 17, 2003, after arriving at the host contractor\u2019s site, he \nrevised Attachment 2 to his ISSP, entitled \u201cSystem Identification and Requirements \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSpecification, by adding the following sentence: \u201cThis IS contains a portable Laptop PC \nused in the Standalone mode for classified presentations and the processing of \nclassified acoustic data at [Applicant\u2019s company name] customer facilities capable of \nhandling classified information up to the level of secret.\u201d He revised Attachment 3, \nentitled \u201cHardware Baseline\u201d to add a Sony memory stick. He saved the revisions on his \nlaptop but did not print them. He testified he thought it was likely he would need to use \nhis computer in a classified mode on the following day, and he used his free time on the \nevening of February 17 to make the changes to his ISSP. He did not consult with or \nnotify his ISR about the changes. He denied making the changes in anticipation of \nsomeone at the host contractor\u2019s site confronting him about his authority to do classified \nwork on his computer at that location (Tr. 274-75). \n \nBecause of inclement weather, the arrival of the attendees for the presentation \nwas delayed and the time allotted for his presentation was cut from four hours to two \n(Tr. 192-93). \n \nOn February 18, 2003, Applicant purchased the memory stick listed on \nAttachment 3 and copied his classified presentation onto it (GX 12 at 2; Tr. 198). He \nused his own laptop for classified work because the host contractor had been unable to \ntimely provide him with a classified computer at its facility (Tr. 194). He did not notify his \nISR that the memory stick had been added to his information system. \n \nOn February 19, 2003, Applicant provided the Sony memory stick to a host \ncontractor employee for use in a host contractor computer during his classified \npresentation. After his presentation, he mailed the Sony memory stick, classified hard \ndrive, and classified compact disc back to his office. He hand-carried his laptop, without \nthe classified hard drive, authorized by a courier letter he had signed as FSO (AX AA). \n \nOn February 26, 2003, Applicant returned to the host contractor\u2019s site. He hand-\ncarried the Sony memory stick containing his classified presentation and a classified \ncompact disc. He used his memory stick in a host contractor\u2019s computer for his \npresentation, and then hand-carried both the memory stick and classified compact disc \nback home on a commercial aircraft. Again, he signed the courier letter as FSO (AX \nCC). \n \nApplicant testified he did not believe the addition of the memory stick to his ISSP \nrequired reaccreditation, because it was removable media, like a CD or DVD. He has \nsince learned that it is considered a hard drive and requires reaccreditation (Tr. 267). \n \nThe ISR overseeing Applicant\u2019s company since 2001 testified that accreditation \nis a government function, but that certification can be done by a contractor if DSS \nauthorizes self-certification. Authority to self-certify must be requested as part of the \nISSP, and DSS would determine whether the contractor has the technical experience \nand skills to convince DSS to allow self-certification (Tr. 30-32). The ISR testified that \nApplicant did not have authority to self-certify (Tr. 33, 69-70).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe ISR testified that Applicant\u2019s relocation of his laptop computer and the \naddition of the memory stick were two changes requiring notification of the CSA and \nreaccreditation under NISPOM \u00b6 8-104f (Tr. 50-51). This provision requires notification \nof the CSA \u201cwhen an IS no longer processes classified information, or when changes \noccur that might affect accreditation.\u201d NISPOM \u00b6 8-202c provides, \u201cAll modifications to \nsecurity-relevant resources (including software, firmware, hardware, or interfaces and \ninterconnections to networks) shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with \nprocedures prior to implementation.\u201d ISL 01L-1, cited in Applicant\u2019s ISSP, defines \n\u201csecurity-relevant\u201d hardware changes requiring review and approval as \u201cany IS \ncomponent that contains, or has the potential of containing classified information.\u201d The \nISR testified that if Applicant was unsure whether addition of the memory stick was a \n\u201csecurity relevant\u201d change, he was expected to contact his ISR for a ruling before he \nimplemented it (Tr. 51). \n \nThe ISR further testified that even the \u201cshell\u201d of a laptop, with the hard drive \nremoved, is required to be kept within the perimeter of the site documented in the ISSP. \nIf Applicant wanted to remove his laptop, even without the classified hard drive, he was \nrequired to notify DSS and obtain approval to remove it. If he later returned the laptop to \nthe designated site, he was required to request reactivation of the prior approval, and \nDSS would determine whether an on-site inspection was required prior to reactivation \n(Tr. 55). The NISPOM \u00b6 8-308a requires establishment of safeguards to detect \n\u201cunauthorized modification of the IS hardware and software.\u201d It further provides that \n\u201c[h]ardware integrity of the IS, including remote equipment, shall be maintained at all \ntimes, even when all classified information has been removed from the IS.\u201d The \nNISPOM \u00b6 8-308b provides that \u201cClassified information shall take place in a CSA-\napproved area.\u201d Applicant did not dispute any of the ISR\u2019s interpretations of the \nNISPOM or ISL 01L-1. \n \nWhile Applicant was editing his classified presentation on his laptop on February \n18, 2003, he was asked by the host contractor\u2019s FSO if he was authorized to process \nclassified material outside his own facility. The evidence regarding his response is \nconflicting.  \n \nDuring the ISR\u2019s inquiry into the report of Applicant\u2019s security violations in March \n2003, the FSO said she asked Applicant about his usage of his laptop to process \nclassified information at their facility. She wanted to know if he had \u201csigned DSS \napproval for his AIS plan allowing usage of that laptop at other facilities for classified \nprocessing.\u201d She stated Applicant responded, \u201cYes, I do have approval from my DSS \nrep to use this company laptop at other facilities to process classified.\u201d He also told her \nhe had used his laptop to process classified material at other facilities. She asked \nApplicant to provide her with a copy of the DSS approval and he agreed (GX 20 at 14). \nApplicant admitted to the ISR that he said he had DSS approval even though approval \nhad not been requested and he admitted misleading the FSO by telling her he had used \nhis laptop to process classified material at other facilities because he wanted her to go \naway and stop interfering with his work. Applicant told the ISR that he had never \nprocessed classified materials on his laptop at other facilities (GX 20 at 5-6). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nWhen the ISR interviewed Applicant, he was not sure Applicant knew he had \ncommitted a security violation (Tr. 93). However, the ISR came to the conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s violations were willful and knowing because he created the false document \npurporting to change the ISSP (Tr. 87). The ISR testified the document was false \nbecause Applicant represented it as having been approved by DSS, when it was not \n(Tr. 90). The ISR concluded there was no unauthorized disclosure of classified \ninformation (Tr. 109). \n \nIn a statement to a security investigator in November 2003, Applicant stated the \nhost contractor\u2019s FSO wanted to see a copy of the DSS approval to process classified \nmaterial on his laptop at their site, and he agreed to send it to her. Applicant told the \ninvestigator he did not remember saying he had used his laptop for classified work at \nother facilities. He admitted being unresponsive to her questions because she was \ninterfering with his work (GX 12 at 2). \n \n \nIn an interview with another security investigator in April 2004, he admitted trying \nto mislead the host contractor\u2019s FSO (VTC Tr. 11-12; GX 18). He admitted telling her he \nhad DSS approval to use his laptop at other facilities and had done so in the past (GX \n18 at 2). \n \nIn November 2005, another government agency notified Applicant of its intent to \nrevoke his eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). One of \nthe allegations on which the intent to revoke was based was his admission that he \nintentionally misled the host contractor\u2019s FSO by stating he had DSS approval to use his \nlaptop at other facilities and had done so in the past. He responded to the notice of \nintent to revoke by stating, \u201cThis allegation is true, but there is an explanation.\u201d He then \ndescribed the host contractor\u2019s failure to provide a classified computer, the need to \nrevise the presentation on short notice, and his frustration and impatience when the \nFSO challenged him (GX 25 at 5). \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant recanted his earlier admissions to intentionally \nmisleading the host contractor\u2019s FSO (Tr. 285). He testified the FSO asked if he was \nworking on a classified information system and he told her he had DSS approval to use \nhis laptop as a classified information system (Tr. 201). He testified he told her he was \nthe ISSM and he had revised his ISSP to authorize working with classified information \non his laptop at other facilities (Tr. 203). He testified he was confused about what she \nwas asking for, because she was concerned about two issues\u2014his authority to use his \nlaptop for classified work and his authority to use his laptop at the host contractor\u2019s site. \nHe testified he did not intentionally mislead the host contractor\u2019s FSO, and that he did \nnot tell her he had DSS approval for off-site classified work on his laptop because he \nknew he did not have it (Tr. 214). He testified he did not intend to mislead her, but that \nhis intention was \u201cjust to go back to work.\u201d He believed he was answering different \nquestions than she was asking and he did not understand what she was asking (Tr. \n291). He did not believe he told her he had used his laptop to process classified \n\n \n8 \n \n \ninformation off-site on other occasions (Tr. 216). He testified the conversation was \n\u201ccurt,\u201d and \u201cnot particularly\u201d cordial (Tr. 215). \n \nAt some time after February 18, 2003, the host contractor notified its local ISR \nabout Applicant\u2019s use of his laptop for classified work, and the local ISR notified \nApplicant\u2019s ISR on March 10, 2003. The ISR conducted the administrative inquiry \ndiscussed above, and he concluded that Applicant knowingly and intentionally violated \nvarious provisions of the NISPOM, prepared a falsified ISSP, and falsely represented to \nthe host contractor that the revised ISSP was approved by DSS. The ISR \nrecommended the accreditation for Applicant\u2019s ISSP be withdrawn, but his \nrecommendation was not adopted. Applicant\u2019s ISSP was reaccredited in November \n2004 (AX O) and June 2005 (AX Q). \n \nAs a result of the administrative inquiry, the chairman of the board of Applicant\u2019s \ncompany required him to execute a \u201cletter of commitment\u201d to full compliance with all \napplicable security measures, write a supplement to the security regulations applicable \nto the company, provide the chairman with copies of documentation pertaining to the \nprocessing, storage, and handling of classified information, and to pay a fine of one \nweek\u2019s pay, about $1,600. The money was donated to a high school scholarship fund in \nmemory of a U.S. Marine killed in Iraq (Tr. 227; GX 14 at 3; AX Y; AX Z). Applicant \ntestified he intends to transfer ownership of the company to his brother, the current \nchairman of the board, as part of the mitigation plan to retain his facility clearance (Tr. \n235). \n \nIn May 2003, Applicant submitted a revised ISSP adding the Sony memory stick \nto his information system (GX 10, Attachment 8). He had submitted a revised ISSP with \nthe authorization for off-site classified work on his laptop, but he removed that provision \nin accordance with his ISR\u2019s guidance (Tr. 223). \n \nIn an interview with a DSS agent in April 2004, Applicant admitted he used the \nsame laptop for classified and unclassified work and that he took the laptop with him for \nalmost all trips, as well as trips to his son\u2019s house, daughter\u2019s house, and his leased \noffice space, a total of about 24 times until February 2003 (GX 15). At the hearing, he \ntestified he believed it was permissible to remove the laptop from his designated work \nspace without violating any rules, so long as he removed and secured the classified \nhard drive. When advised that it was a security violation to remove the laptop from his \ncleared facility, even if the classified drive was removed, he purchased a second laptop \nfor unclassified work away from his cleared facility (Tr. 224). \n \nThe NISPOM \u00b6 1-201 requires that an FSO complete the security training \nspecified in the NISPOM and \u201cas deemed appropriate by the CSA.\u201d At the hearing, \nApplicant admitted it was a mistake to delay his training as an FSO. He testified that \nwhat he learned in the FSO management course could have prevented \u201calmost all of \nthis stuff\u201d from happening. He testified he cannot afford to make the same mistakes \nagain. He has learned that there are requirements in the NISPOM that are unclear, and \nthat he should discuss all changes with his ISR to avoid further mistakes (Tr. 236). \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nOn March 28, 2008, Applicant\u2019s personal security clearance was suspended \nbecause of a decision by another government agency to revoke his eligibility for access \nto (SCI) (AX T). The basis for the revocation of SCI access included the conduct alleged \nin the SOR (AX U). According to his ISR, Applicant was completely cooperative when \nthe ISR came to his home office to clear out his safe (Tr. 85). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant willfully and deliberately violated the NISPOM by \naccessing classified information on his DSS accredited laptop at a host contractor\u2019s \nfacility without prior DSS authorization or approval (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he willfully and \ndeliberately violated the NISPOM by bringing a classified hard drive to a host \ncontractor\u2019s facility and downloading classified material onto a memory stick (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b); and he deliberately violated the NISPOM by altering classified material by \nobliterating the classified markings on 10 pages of a 50-page document without \nnotifying his security manager (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Department Counsel elected not to present \nevidence or otherwise pursue SOR \u00b6 1.c (Tr. 4). \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline K is set out in AG & 33 as follows: \n\u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting \nclassified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual's \ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such \ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\u201d  \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant \nto this case: \nCollecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or in \nany other unauthorized location (AG \u00b6 34(b)); \nLoading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment (AG \u00b6 34(c)); and \n\n \n11 \n \n \nAny failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information (AG \u00b6 34(g)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s removal of his laptop from its approved location, use of the laptop at \nan unapproved location, and use of an unapproved memory stick raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b), (c), \nand (g). Since the government produced substantial evidence to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing \u201cso much \ntime has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d (AG \u00b6 35(a).) This \ncondition has three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It can be established \nif \u201cso much time has elapsed,\u201d or it happened \u201cso infrequently\u201d or \u201cunder such unusual \ncircumstances\u201d that it is unlikely to recur.  If any of the three conjunctive prongs are \nestablished, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the behavior \u201cdoes \nnot cast doubt\u201d on reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The first prong is \nestablished because Applicant\u2019s behavior happened more than five years ago and has \nnot recurred. The second prong is established because the violations occurred on only \ntwo occasions in February 2003. These were his only security violations during the 40-\nyear period in which he held a clearance. The third prong is established because the \nviolations were the result of a confluence of unusual conditions that are not likely to \nrecur: Applicant\u2019s inadequate training for his responsibilities as ISSM and FSO, delay of \nthe briefing by bad weather, a requirement to drastically edit the briefing when the \nallotted time was cut in half, and inability of the host contractor to provide a classified \ncomputer for the editing process.  \n \n \nThe last prong, however, is not established because Applicant\u2019s deceptive \nresponses to the host contractor\u2019s FSO, representation that DSS had approved his \nmodified ISSP allowing off-site use of his laptop for classified work, and his recantation \nat the hearing of his prior admissions cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The inconsistency between Applicant\u2019s multiple \nadmissions to intentionally misleading the FSO and his recantation of those admissions \nat the hearing means that either his earlier admissions or his recantation at the hearing \nwere untrue. Either alternative would raise doubt about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \n \nI found Applicant\u2019s recantation of his earlier admissions at the hearing not \ncredible. He consistently admitted intentionally misleading the FSO during the inquiry by \nhis ISR in March 2003, during an interview with a security investigator in April 2004, \nduring an interview with another security investigator in April 2004, and in his response \nto the notification of intent to revoke his eligibility for access to SCI in November 2005. \nThe evidence strongly suggests his recantation at the hearing was prompted by the \n\n \n12 \n \n \nrevocation of his SCI eligibility and the realization that his security clearance and ability \nto continue working as a consultant were in jeopardy.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s recantation was not alleged in the SOR, however, conduct not \nalleged in the SOR may be considered: A(a) to assess an applicant=s credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant=s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; \n(c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to \ndecide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) \nto provide evidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.@ ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I considered his \nrecantation for the limited purposes of accessing his credibility, to decide whether the \nconduct alleged in the SOR casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment, and in my whole-person analysis set out below. \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated by evidence that \u201cthe individual \nresponded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates \na positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d (AG \u00b6 35(b).) I am \nsatisfied Applicant\u2019s unauthorized use of his laptop for classified work at the host \ncontractor\u2019s site and his unauthorized use of the memory stick were inadvertent \nviolations. He volunteered the use of his computer when it appeared that a classified \ncomputer would not be available at the contractor\u2019s site. Because of his limited \nexperience and lack of training as an ISSM and FSO, he believed he had authority to \nmodify his ISSM. It was not until he was challenged by the contractor\u2019s FSO that he \nrealized he might need his DSS approval for remote use of his laptop for classified \nwork. I found his explanation for using the memory stick, i.e., that he thought it was \nremovable media that did not require DSS approval, was plausible and credible. He \nfinally completed his FSO training, obtained DSS approval for his modified ISSP, \nacquired a second computer dedicated to unclassified work, and has had no further \nsecurity violations. I conclude AG \u00b6 35(b) is established. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d (AG \u00b6 35(c).) At \nthe time of the violations, Applicant had completed online courses regarding the \nhandling of classified information, and he appears to have complied fully with the \nNISPOM when he transported and secured his classified materials in February 2003. \nAlthough his ISSP was approved and accredited in December 2001, he still had not \ncompleted his FSO training when the violations occurred in February 2003.  He \nadmitted at the hearing that the violations would not have occurred if he had timely \ncompleted the FSO hearing. However, while the inadequate training caused the \nviolations, the fault lies with Applicant for not timely completing it. Applicant receives \nonly limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 35(c) because his culpable failure to attend FSO \ntraining was a major factor in causing the violations. \n\n \n13 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c as personal conduct under \nthis guideline (SOR \u00b6 2.a). It also alleges Applicant deliberately attempted to cover up \nhis security violations by falsely stating he had DSS authority to use his laptop at other \nfacilities (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and by revising his ISSP to authorize using his laptop to process \nclassified information at other facilities (SOR \u00b6 2.c).  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d A potentially disqualifying \ncondition under this guideline can be raised by \u201cdeliberately providing false or \nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n16(b).) Applicant\u2019s false and misleading responses to the host contractor\u2019s FSO and his \nrepresentation that he had DSS approval for remote use of his laptop for classified work \nraise this condition. \nA potentially disqualifying condition also may arise from \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(c).) While Applicant presented substantial mitigating evidence \nregarding his security violations under Guideline K, his misrepresentations to the \ncontractor\u2019s FSO and his lack of candor at the hearing are sufficient to raise this \ndisqualifying condition under Guideline E. \nFinally, a potentially disqualifying condition may arise from \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 16(d).) This disqualifying condition \nencompasses \u201cuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior\u201d and \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule \nviolations.\u201d (AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(1) and (3).)  \nOn its face, AG \u00b6 16(d) appears to cover only information \u201cthat is not explicitly \ncovered under any other guideline.\u201d The Appeal Board, however, has construed AG \u00b6 \n16(d) more broadly, holding: \u201c(1) it continues the longstanding tenet that specific \nbehavior can have security significance under more than one guideline and (2) by \nfocusing on the concepts of questionable judgment and irresponsibility, it contemplates \nthat behavior will have independent security significance under Guideline E in a broad \n\n \n14 \n \n \nrange of cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-20964 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008), 2008 WL 2002589 \nat *4. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by Applicant\u2019s misleading responses to the FSO \nand his false representation that DSS had approved his modified ISSP. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no \neffort to correct his misrepresentations to the FSO until the host contractor\u2019s ISR \ncontacted Applicant\u2019s ISR, who questioned him about the incident. I conclude this \nmitigating condition is not established. \nSecurity concerns also can be mitigating if \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). This mitigating condition is \nnot established for the reasons set out above in the discussion of AG \u00b6 35(a) under \nGuideline K. \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that \ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is \nunlikely to recur\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant initially acknowledged his misrepresentations to \nthe FSO, but this mitigating condition is not established because he recanted his earlier \nacknowledgement of intentionally misleading her. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n\n \n15 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, highly educated, very intelligent, very articulate person. He \nhas held a clearance for more than 40 years. His security violations in February 2003 \nwere attributable to his lack of training and experience as a security manager and FSO. \nThe organizational structure of his company, although approved by DSS, lacked \neffective safeguards against inadvertent security violations. It made him the ISSM and \nFSO, positions for which he had no training or experience. There is no evidence of \nefforts by DSS to compel Applicant to complete the required training in a timely manner. \nSince the security violations in February 2003, he has taken corrective action, \ncompleted the required training, and has had no further security violations. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his misleading comments to the contractor\u2019s FSO and \nattempted cover-up of his violations until another agency withdrew his eligibility for \naccess to SCI. He then recanted his earlier admissions, and at the hearing he denied \nintentionally misleading the FSO. While his deceptive conduct with the FSO, standing \nalone, could be considered an isolated incident, his lack of candor at the hearing causes \nserious concern about his current reliability and trustworthiness. Although his lack of \ncandor at the hearing is not alleged in the SOR, it may be considered as part of the \nwhole person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327, supra. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines K and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on handling protected information, \nbut he has not mitigated the security concerns based on personal conduct. Accordingly, \nI conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by the Department of\nDefense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 8, 2010. The case was assigned to\nme on June 14, 2010, and was scheduled for hearing on July 21, 2010.  A hearing was\nheld on the scheduled date. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of 20\nDecember 9, 2010\n\n2\nexhibits (GE).  All of the Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted. Applicant relied on one\nwitness (himself) and two exhibits (AE). The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 29,\n2010. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly resigned his position as acting fire\nlieutenant for a city fire department in September 2003, in lieu of involuntary termination\nfor the following conduct: (1) untruthful during an EEO statement; (2) violation of sexual\nharassment policy; (3) use of position in an inpropriate manner; (4) compromise of a\nfelony investigation; and (5) actions not favorable to the City, Fire Department, and\nPolice Department.  In his February 2010 response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each\nof the allegations.  He provided no explanations. \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old mechanical technician for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married in November 1982 and has two children (ages 26 and 23) from\nhis marriage. (GE 1) He and his wife have since divorced. Applicant has a high school\ndiploma and a fire academy certificate from a reputable technical school. Applicant has\nno military service and has been employed by his current employer since November\n2003. (GE 1)  \nActing on the recommendations of an old friend, Applicant (in 1981) went to work\nfor a local municipality. (GE 4).  He took leave from his job in 1983 to attend college, and\nresumed his city employment in 1986 with the city\u2019s local fire department. (see GEs 2\nand 4)  He received regular promotions during his first ten years of service with the city\u2019s\nfire department. In 1996, he attended the city\u2019s police academy and became a fire\ninspector. (compare GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 82) Although commissioned by the police\ndepartment, he continued to work for the fire department and was responsible for fire\ninvestigations. (GE 2)  \nIn 2001, Applicant began working on a fire investigation case that involved two\nbrothers (A and B). These brothers founded and owned separate businesses that\nserviced fire extinguishing equipment and fire protection systems. (GE 2) Applicant\nworked on this case in cooperation with a detective (D) for the local police department.\n(Tr. 88)\nIn the process of working his department\u2019s case against B, D learned that B\u2019s wife\n(C) was a dispatcher for the central dispatch for the city\u2019s police and fire departments.\n(GE 2)  When they initially presented their case to the city\u2019s district attorney (DA), the DA\ntold them their case was weak and requested more evidence. (GE 2) The DA also\n\n3\nsuggested that Applicant and D back off their investigation of B for the time being. (Tr.\n90)\nSometime later (in 2002), C approached Applicant and asked him \u201cwhat was\ngoing on with the case against B.\u201d (GE 2) In this conversation, Applicant provided C\ndetails of the investigation against her husband. (GE 2) Applicant advised the DA of his\ncontacts with C and was told that he should not have discussed the case with her. (GE\n2)  Applicant\u2019s superior also criticized him for discussing the case with C.\nShortly after Applicant was counseled by the DA to avoid conversations with C\nabout the status of the investigation against B, B and C joined Applicant and D in a\nlawsuit against the city.  In their complaint, they accused Applicant and D of \u201csingling\nthem out and harassing them.\u201d (GE 2)  After they were investigated by EEO personnel,\nApplicant and D were cleared by the police department\u2019s internal affairs division of any\nwrongdoing. (GE 2)   \nApplicant and D continued to work the case against A and B throughout 2002.  As\nthe result of their investigation, A was arrested for fraud. (GE 2) Following his arrest, A\nwas jailed for a week. When he was released pending charges against him, he\ncommitted suicide. (GE 2; Tr. 94) Applicant and D were subsequently cleared by their\nfire and police departments of any wrongdoing in connection with the arrest of A. (GE 8)\nApplicant and D, in turn, put their investigation of B on hold. (GE 2) C and B thereafter\ndropped their harassment suit against Applicant and D. (Tr. 95-97)\nIn a taped January 2003 telephone conversation with C (initiated by Applicant),\nApplicant asked C on several occasions whether she and her husband were still living\ntogether and discussed his own marital status with her. (see GEs 9 and 14).  Told by C\nthat she was still married and living with her husband, Applicant responded as follows:\n\u201cSo coming to your house is not an option, I guess, if he\u2019s there.\u201d (GE 2) Before\nterminating his conversation with C, he inquired if she was still \u201cdoing massages at all.\u201d\n(GE 2)  When she responded affirmatively, Applicant suggested that \u201cmaybe we\u2019ll talk\nabout that.\u201d (GE 2)  C reacted positively to Applicant\u2019s suggestion.  \nAfter more fraud complaints were filed against B, Applicant and D activated their\ninvestigation of B.  In August 2003, C contacted Applicant by telephone and asked to\nmeet him to discuss the case.  When Applicant arrived at the meeting site, C entered\nApplicant\u2019s city vehicle and pressed him for details of his investigation against B.\nApplicant told C of another complaint against B, and an instituted investigation against B\nby the local police department. After thanking him for the information, C exited\nApplicant\u2019s vehicle. (GE 2)  \nEEO inquiry re: C\u2019s discrimination charges\nIn response to C\u2019s sexual harassment charges against Applicant and the city, the\ncity\u2019s EEO conducted its own inquiry. The assigned EEO inspector asked Applicant\nseveral questions pertaining to C\u2019s harassment complaint, which drew untruthful\nresponses from Applicant. When the inspector asked Applicant whether he ever\n\n4\nsocialized with C, Applicant answered \u201cnever.\u201d (GEs 8 and 13) Asked whether he had\never had any personal discussions with C over marriage and potential sexual\nexchanges, he again said \u201cnever.\u201d (GEs 8 and 13) He answered no, too, to the\ninspector\u2019s question of whether he ever received a massage from C, and to the question\nof whether C had ever been in his city vehicle. (see GE 13) And Applicant answered in\nthe negative to the inspector\u2019s question of whether Applicant ever discussed with C any\naspects of the pending investigation of her husband (B)\nWhen later confronted by the police investigator detailed to his department\u2019s own\ninternal investigation of Applicant\u2019s reported actions, Applicant admitted to socializing\nwith C at a birthday party in May 2000 and having coffee with her on other occasions.\n(see GE 12) After being confronted with C\u2019s reporting of massages to Applicant,\nApplicant acknowledged he received a massage to his shoulder from C. (GE 12)\nHowever, he continued to deny more extended contacts with C, and denied any sexual\ncontact with C whatsoever. (GE 12) \nBesides interviewing Applicant, the police investigator assigned to investigate\nApplicant\u2019s role in the events claimed by C in her complaint, talked to some of C\u2019s\ncoworkers in the fire and police dispatcher\u2019s office.  One of C\u2019s coworkers confirmed that\nApplicant had made many calls to her office inquiring about C\u2019s whereabouts. (GE 12).\nThis investigator also contrasted Applicant\u2019s claims in his taped conversation with C\nabout his involvement in an ongoing investigation of B with his own understanding of the\nabsence of any ongoing investigation of B. (GE 12). Another of Applicant\u2019s coworkers\nconfirmed that she had numerous personal conversations and social exchanges with him\nfollowing her employment in 1999. (GE 12) She claimed he made advances to her,\nwhich she rebuffed. (GE 12). A social friend of C\u2019s confirmed a three-way social\nexchange between herself, C, and Applicant,  in which C\u2019s opening of her massage\nparlor became a topic of discussion. (GE 12) \nAfter reviewing Applicant\u2019s taped conversation with C, the police investigator\nfound Applicant\u2019s answers to the questions propounded to him to be false and untruthful\nin many ways when compared to the accounts of C and the other witnesses interviewed.\n(GE 13)  In his own conclusions, he confirmed that Applicant failed to cooperate with an\nofficial EEO investigation and was untruthful about an official investigation initiated\nagainst B in 2002. (GE 12) He underscored several police department rules and\nregulations violated by Applicant: failure to maintain proper telephone courtesy with the\npublic; conduct unbecoming a police department employee; failure to abide by internal\npolice department rules of conduct; failure to adhere to the department\u2019s anti-harassment\npolicy; failure to be truthful in a police investigation; and failure to safeguard the\nconfidentiality of police business. (see GEs 12 and 13).  \nBased on his own internal findings with respect to a prior police investigation in\n2002 and the current one involving his communications and relations with  C, this police\ninvestigator recommended the termination of Applicant\u2019s commission with the police\ndepartment and the forwarding of any further considered actions of discipline to the city\u2019s\nfire department. (GE 12) This police investigator repeated his findings concerning\nApplicant responses to questions from the EEO inspector\u2019s June 2003 interview with\n\n5\nApplicant when he met with the fire marshal (Applicant\u2019s supervisor) in August 2003.\n(see GE13) \nCity\u2019s Personnel and Administrative policies\nThe city\u2019s personnel policies in place throughout the 2002 and 2003 periods of\nApplicant\u2019s employment required employees to avoid any form of unlawful discrimination\nand be cooperative and truthful at all times with city investigators in administrative\ninvestigations. (see GE 14) Rules of conduct governing the city\u2019s fire and emergency\nservices personnel required every fire department member to behave in a self-disciplined\nmanner and be responsible to regulate his or her conduct with a positive, productive, and\nmature attitude. \nRules of conduct required city fire and emergency personnel to: follow all policies,\nprocedures, and written directives of the city; conduct themselves in a manner that will\nreflect positively on the fire department; and operate safely and use good judgment\nbased on training and directives. (GE 14)   Violations of any of the city\u2019s personnel and\nadministrative policies was cause for disciplinary action ranging from counseling up to\nand including dismissal. (GE 14)\nThe city\u2019s personnel policy included a section governing employee ethics. The\ncity\u2019s ethics policy barred employees from using their positions for personal gain and\nunwarranted benefit or treatment. Misuse of an employee\u2019s official position was\nprohibited by the ethics policy.  Improper use or disclosure of information gained from a\ncity employee\u2019s employment that could result in a benefit to the employee or his family\nwas also prohibited by the city\u2019s personnel policy. \nApplicant was fully briefed on the city\u2019s personnel and administrative policies prior\nto 2002.  Records document that Applicant received a copy of the city\u2019s racial and sexual\nharassment discrimination policy and training on sexual harassment in October 1996.\n(GE 5). In May 2000, he acknowledged his receipt of the city\u2019s revised employee\nhandbook. (GE 6).  This revised handbook covered the city\u2019s work rules and personnel\npolicies for the city\u2019s police and fire departments. (GE 6)  \nCity disciplinary actions taken against Applicant \nIn August 2003, the city\u2019s fire marshal (Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor) and\ninvestigating officer interviewed Applicant about the result of their internal investigation.\n(GE 14).  In this interview, they challenged Applicant on the answers he provided the\nEEO officer in his June 2003 interview of Applicant. In this interview, Applicant\ncharacterized his answers in his June 2003 interview differently from the way he\nresponded in his June 2003 interview in a number of material respects. \nFinding irreconcilable inconsistencies in his statements, his supervisor concluded\nthat Applicant was not completely truthful in all of his responses. (GE 14) The fire\nmarshal also noted material inconsistencies in the accounts Applicant provided police\ninvestigators in 2002 and those he furnished in his August 2003 interview. (GE 14)   \n\n6\nBased on his review of the evidence compiled in the city\u2019s investigation,\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor concluded that Applicant\u2019s comments to C in his taped\nconversation with her in January 2003 were of a sexual nature and were designed to\nappeal for some type of sexual favor or request. (GE 14) Finding Applicant\u2019s telephone\nconversation with C to have been conducted while he was on official city duty, he\ndetermined Applicant\u2019s sexual comments to have violated the city\u2019s published\nharassment policy.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor also determined that Applicant used his position in an\ninappropriate manner. (GE 14)  Having gained fire and police department information\nthrough his official position, he shared this confidential information with C in his capacity\nas a department inspector and investigator. His supervisor found Applicant\u2019s actions to\nreflect the appearance of preferential treatment and possible coercing of C to participate\nin activities and/or gain information irrelevant to an investigation. Applicant\u2019s supervisor\nfound Applicant\u2019s actions as a commissioned law enforcement officer to constitute a use\nof his position not related to job duties and responsibilities and indicative of poor\njudgment and an abuse of position and power.  In the judgment of Applicant\u2019s supervisor,\nsharing information and using his position for personal gain in this manner violated the\ncity\u2019s work rules and ethics policy. (GE 14)  \nIn the judgment of Applicant\u2019s supervisor, Applicant\u2019s actions also compromised\nan ongoing investigation of A and B.  A and B were considered felony suspects at the\ntime, and Applicant\u2019s contacts with B\u2019s wife in these circumstances jeopardized the\npotential outcome of the case in the view of Applicant\u2019s supervisor. (GE 14) By sharing\ninvestigative information with the wife of a suspect and compromising a felony case,\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor determined Applicant violated the city\u2019s personnel and ethics\npolicies. (GE 14).  \nAfter a thorough review of all of the evidence compiled by his department in its\ninternal investigation of Applicant\u2019s conduct, Applicant\u2019s supervisor concluded, too, that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and behavior created questions regarding the impartiality and\nobjectivity of his performance as a city employee. (GE 14) By engaging in activity that is\nprejudicial to the best interests of the city and its fire department, Applicant\u2019s supervisor\ndetermined Applicant violated the city\u2019s personnel and ethics policies. (GE 14)   \nBefore deciding on his recommended course of disciplinary action for Applicant,\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor reviewed Applicant\u2019s employment history. (GE 14) Applicant\u2019s\nhistory included a number of  prior disciplinary actions taken against him between July\n1994 and February 2003.  \nIn recommending termination of Applicant\u2019s city employment, Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor prefaced his recommendations with his characterizing of Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nHe characterized Applicant\u2019s collective actions as contrary to the expectations of his\ndepartment and city.  He stressed Applicant\u2019s violations of numerous city policies, and\nplacing the city at an increased risk for liability.  Based on his review of the facts provided\nthrough the course of the investigation, his supervisor concluded that Applicant\ncommitted acts that were: untruthful during an administrative investigation; violated the\ncity\u2019s sexual harassment policy; utilized his position in an inappropriate manner;\n\n7\ncompromised a felony investigation; and participated in conduct prejudicial to the best\ninterests of the city. (GE 14) His supervisor, in turn recommended involuntary termination\nfrom employment with the city\u2019s fire department and city.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of his supervisor\u2019s findings in September 2003.\n(GE 14)  One week later, Applicant submitted his resignation. His resignation was\naccepted by the city\u2019s fire chief, and ultimately was accepted by the city in lieu of\ninvoluntary termination. (see Ges 18 through 20)  \nApplicant\u2019s OPM interviews\nIn a September 2006 interview with an agent from the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM), Applicant reviewed the history of his involvement in the\ninvestigation of A and B for the city and his telling C about the investigation of her\nhusband as she sat in his parked city vehicle. (GE 2) He covered C\u2019s harassment\ncomplaint and his meeting with his supervisor and department investigator in September\n2003. (GE 2)  However, Applicant denied most of the charges preferred against him by\nhis supervisor that led his supervisor to recommend his involuntary termination. His\ndenials were material and reflect ongoing rejection of his supervisor\u2019s core findings about\nApplicant\u2019s untruthfulness during the investigation and the city\u2019s claimed personnel and\nethics policies. (GE 2)  \nOPM conducted a follow-up interview with Applicant in June 2008. (GE 4) As a\npart of this interview, Applicant was asked to give a signed affidavit covering all of the\nevents and circumstances that gave rise to his 2003 resignation in lieu of termination.\nApplicant provided a fairly detailed summary of most of the events leading up his\ndepartment\u2019s investigation of his actions in his investigation of A and B.  His statement\ncovered his investigations of A and B and his acquaintance with C.  He acknowledged\nsharing information with C about the ongoing investigation of her husband (citing the\nlikely guilt of her husband and his sympathy for her), and the ensuing harassment suit\nshe and B filed against D, himself, and the city. (GE 4)  Applicant also described his fire\ndepartment\u2019s opened internal investigation as the result of C\u2019s initiation of her lawsuit.\nApplicant also mentioned C and Bs\u2019 withdrawal of their lawsuit against the city, and his\ndepartment\u2019s resumption of its internal investigation against B. So, too, he explained C\u2019s\napproaching him once again for information about his department\u2019s renewed\ninvestigation of her husband. (GE 4)  And he acknowledged C\u2019s getting into his parked\ncity vehicle to inquire about the city\u2019s investigation of B. \nBut Applicant also omitted important details of his department\u2019s internal\ninvestigation of his actions and behavior as a fire investigator assigned to the\ninvestigation of C\u2019s husband, as well as the plausible, credible findings of his supervisor\nthat the latter used to recommend Applicant\u2019s employment termination. Besides omitting\nmaterial details of his taped telephonic exchanges with C and his false denials when\nquestioned by a city EEO investigator, he reiterated his denials of all of C\u2019s remaining\ncharges levied against him. He attributed his forced resignation to an absence of backing\nby his supervisor and fire chief, and not to any wrongdoing on his part. (GE 4) And he\nassured he tendered his resignation due to some poor choices on his part, and not\nbecause he had committed any knowing and willful wrongdoing. (GE 4).\n\n8\nBased on Applicant\u2019s own taped statements and the highly plausible and credible\ninferences that the police investigator and his supervisor drew and used to base their\nrespective termination recommendations, Applicant\u2019s limited explanations of the facts\nand circumstances that led to his own decision to resign and avert involuntary\ntermination cannot be accepted as true and accurate accounts. Applicant\u2019s explanations\nlack completeness and material acknowledgments of the supported findings made by the\npolice investigator and his supervisor, and cited as the basis of their recommended\npersonnel actions against Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s hearing accounts\nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant acknowledged being untruthful in the EEO\ninvestigation about his relationship with C. With two exceptions, he accepted the findings\nof his supervisor\u2019s termination memorandum as an accurate portrayal of his actions. (Tr.\n117-118) He denied any intentional misrepresentation about C\u2019s getting into his city\nvehicle, and he denied ever receiving a massage from C. (Tr. 109-10) \nBefore A\u2019s suicide in 2002, Applicant and C had been just good friends. (Tr. 92)\nTheir relationship changed, though, following A\u2019s death. (Tr. 92-93) By the time Applicant\nspoke to C in his taped 2003 telephone conversation, his marriage had deteriorated\nconsiderably. (Tr. 98)  His marriage had been going \u201cdownhill for about ten years prior to\nthat\u201d (Tr. 98), and had essentially ended in 2003.  He described his relationship with C at\nthat time as \u201cbetter than friendly\u201d (Tr. 98), and one that included physically affectionate\nexchanges (e.g., hugging and kissing) without sexual intercourse. (Tr. 98-99) His\nphysically affectionate relationship with C had gone on for some two months before his\ntaped telephone conversation with her in 2003. (Tr. 103-04)  \nPressed at hearing to acknowledge he lied about the nature of his relationship\nwith C, Applicant admitted to giving an intentionally false account to the EEO investigator\nof his relationship with her. (Tr. 108-09) He denied, however, ever receiving a massage\nfrom C (Tr. 109-10), taking her for rides in his city vehicle, or intentionally failing to\ndisclose C\u2019s getting into his city vehicle. (Tr. 111-16)\nBecause of the uncertainty he expressed in his EEO interview about C\u2019s ever\ngetting into his city vehicle, his claims that he made no false claims about her ever\ngetting into his city vehicle may be accepted. A different inference is warranted, however,\nin connection with his previous massage denials.  In light of his past pattern of denials of\nany inappropriate social relationships with C, and his limited disclosures of inappropriate\nbehavior in his more recent OPM interviews, his repeated denial of his ever receiving a\nmassage from C is difficult to reconcile with his reported admission of a massage from C\nin his interview with the city police investigator in 2003.  Before he was confronted by the\ninvestigator and admitted to the massage, he denied receiving one from C then as well.\n(see GE 12)\nBased on a thorough consideration of the exhibits and testimony covering\nApplicant\u2019s EEO investigation and related resignation, Applicant\u2019s assurances lack the\nprobative weight necessary to accept his denials at face value. More probative are the\nfindings of the police investigator who enlisted an admission from him that he received a\n\n9\nmassage from C and Applicant\u2019s supervisor who presented his findings supporting\nApplicant\u2019s recommended termination. After weighing all of the evidence, Applicant\u2019s\nclaims to the contrary cannot be accepted.\nEndorsements\nApplicant is well-regarded by his current supervisor and coworkers. His\nendorsements confirm numerous credits for his contributions to his team\u2019s missions.\n(see AE A and B)  Colleagues who have had considerable experience working with him\ndescribe him as very conscientious and trustworthy. They credit him with demonstrated\ncourage, leadership, and outstanding performance in the execution of his assigned\nresponsibilities as a team leader.  (see AE E)  \nSince joining his current employer, Applicant has never been charged or accused\nof any kind of harassment in the work-place. Nor has he ever been suspended, or\nreprimanded for any misconduct in the workplace, or subjected to any internal\ninvestigations for misconduct in the workplace. (Tr. 188-19)  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account\nfactors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well\nas considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability\nto protect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of\nthe \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c)\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\n\n10\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.  AG, \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 792-800 (1988). As with all\nadversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot\ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of the Government's case. Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n\n11\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a high performing and well-regarded test engineer of a defense\ncontractor who resigned his city position as a fire inspector in 2003 in lieu of being\nterminated for multiple actions violating the city\u2019s personnel and ethics policies. Claiming\nhe resigned after he failed to receive any backing from his supervisor and the city\u2019s fire\nchief, Applicant consistently denied most of the charges against him and continued to\ndeny two cited instances of inappropriate behavior in his hearing testimony. Considered\ntogether, Applicant\u2019s actions create sufficient indicia of serious personal conduct\nquestions about his judgment and trustworthiness to raise security concerns under the\npersonal conduct guideline.\nBecause the judgment and trust lapses associated with the termination actions\ninstituted against him by his city employer in 2003 and ensuing denials in the face of\ncredible evidence supporting the findings of his supervisor involve honesty issues, they\npose personal conduct concerns. Potentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the\ntrust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the actions and\nrepeated denials of Applicant that reflect serious abuses of his duties as a law\nenforcement officer of his city\u2019s fire department. Compounding the adverse findings\nagainst him as a law enforcement officer are his subsequent denials and omissions of\nkey actions and events when afforded opportunities by OPM to provide complete and\naccurate accountings of his underlying conduct. So much trust is imposed on persons\nlike Applicant who are cleared to see classified information that discounting actions that\nreflect serious breaches of trust and candor are gauged very narrowly. \nLooking at the developed facts and circumstances in this case, two of the\ndisqualifying conditions under the personal conduct guideline are applicable to\nAppellant\u2019s situation.  DC \u00b6 16(a), \u201c DC \u00b6 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rules\nviolations,\u201d and DC \u00b6 16(d)(4), \u201cevidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources,\u201d have application to the facts of Appellant\u2019s case.  \nHolding a security clearance, of course, involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor. Trust in a\nperson\u2019s willingness to follow and comply with rules and guidelines he may not\npersonally favor is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the\nclearance.  Failure of the applicant to adhere to prescribed city personnel and ethical\npolicies and acknowledge inappropriate behavior when asked in official interviews\nassociated with ongoing city investigations raises security-significant concerns about the\nsufficiency of the applicant\u2019s demonstrated trust and judgment necessary to safeguard\nclassified information.\nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with, since he has demonstrated a pattern\nof attesting falsely to allegations made against him by persons associated with\ninvestigations involving third parties, as well as those focused on his own actions as a\nlaw enforcement officer.  When confronted by the investigating police officer of his city\nemployer, he initially denied any socializing with C (including massages administered by\nC) before relenting and acknowledging the same when advised of documented tapes\n\n12\nand witness accounts. In his taped conversation with C, he mischaractered his\ninvestigatory role in the investigation of B and was too specific in detailing the subject\nmatter of the investigation to C. By knowingly and willfully failing to disclose all of his\nknown exchanges with C when first interviewed by the EEO investigator, and later by the\ncity\u2019s internal affairs investigator until confronted with compelling facts to the contrary.\nApplicant concealed, or attempted to conceal, materially important background\ninformation needed to complete the investigations mandated by his city employer. He\nalso compromised the integrity of any actual or potential investigation of B with the\ndetails he supplied C in his taped conversation. \nViewing Applicant\u2019s conduct in its entirety, his actions not only violated his\nemployer\u2019s harassment, personnel, and ethics policies, but they illustrate material\nbreaches of sound judgment and trust imposed on law enforcement officials.  Applicant\u2019s\nproven actions also demonstrate Applicant\u2019s unwillingness and reluctance to provide full\ncooperation to both city investigators examining his involvement with C back in 2003,\nand DoD in its more recent efforts to ascertain Applicant\u2019s worthiness to hold a security\nclearance\nWeighing all of the circumstances surrounding his actions while employed as a\ncity fire inspector and ensuing denials in his more recent OPM interviews, even after\nacknowledging receipt of his supervisor\u2019s findings in September 2003, Applicant\u2018s\nactions reflect a material breach of recognized tenets of trust and candor. His failure to\nprovide prompt, good-faith accounts of his actions when afforded multiple opportunities\nto do so, undercuts his ability to successfully mitigate security concerns.\nWhen addressing past actions that reflect proven dishonest and inappropriate\nbehavior and an applicant\u2019s  repeated denials of the same, the Appeal Board has\nconstrued such denials as self-serving claims, and when considered in light of other\ninstances of trust and judgment lapses, determined them to undermine applicant efforts\nto demonstrate rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 08-03620 at 3-4 (App. Bd May 6,\n2000); ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010).  \nBased on a careful review of the administrative record, Applicant may partially rely\non two of the mitigating conditions (MC) of the personal conduct guideline.  Specifically,\nMC \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense if so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, or good judgment,\u201d and  MC \u00b6\n17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change\nthe behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other  inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d have some applicability to Applicant\u2019s situation.\nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant\u2019s actions and contributions to the\ndefense industry warrant positive assessments. Certainly, during his extended time with\nhis defense employer since he resigned from his city employment in 2003, he displayed\nresponsible conduct and has earned the trust and reliability of his current supervisor and\ncoworkers. At the same time, the investigation records from his former city employer and\n\n13\nensuing OPM interviews reflect serious judgment and trust flaws that cannot be\ndiscounted under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence in these types of situations.\nWhile encouraging, Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence and demonstrated\ncontributions with his current employer are not enough to fully mitigate security concerns\nover the mistakes of judgment and trust he displayed as a fire inspector with his former\ncity employer. Mitigation is further weakened by Applicant\u2019s continued refusals to\nacknowledge all of the proven incidents and coverups developed by his city employer\u2019s\nEEO and internal affairs investigations. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nthe  allegations covered by the personal conduct guideline.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubpara. 1.a\n                                Against   Applicant\n                                                    Conclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFrancisco Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJoseph P. Drennan, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is an information technology specialist for a defense contractor.  He has a mother\nand siblings residing in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.  He destroyed his\nJordanian passport before a cognizant security official.  He mitigated security concerns for his family\nmembers in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n\n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive).  The new adjudicative guidelines, promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005,\nand effective in the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006, will be used to adjudicate this\ncase.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 20, 2007.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the\nDirective.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 4, 2007.  He admitted all of the factual\nallegations under both Guidelines but provided an explanation why the facts did not raise a security\nconcern.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and the request was received by\nDOHA on September 6, 2007.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on\nOctober 31, 2007. The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge on November 5, 2007,\nand reassigned to me on November 20, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 28,\n2007, and the hearing convened on December 5, 2007.  Eight government exhibits (Government\nExhibits 1-8) were received and admitted without objection.  Eight Applicant exhibits (Applicant\nExhibits A-H) were received and seven admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant Exhibit\nH was not admitted since it was a duplicate of a matter already in the case file.  The testimony of the\nApplicant and three Applicant witnesses were received during the hearing.  The record was held\nopen for Applicant to submit an additional document (Applicant Exhibit I) which was timely\nsubmitted and admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript on December 17, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nessential findings of fact.\nApplicant is 54 years old and an information technology specialist for a defense contractor.\nHe was born in Jordan, but has lived in other Middle East countries.  He and his family lived in a\nMiddle East country where he received his schooling through high school.  He attended college in\nanother Middle East country where he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in 1976.\nHe returned to the country where he received his early education, and worked as an engineer for four\nyears.  He emigrated to the United States on a student visa in 1980, receiving a Masters of Business\nAdministration degree from a United States university in 1982.  His student visa was changed to a\nwork visa and he commenced working for a friend\u2019s import-export business until 1984 when he\nstarted his own information technology business.  His company did computer programing on a\nsystem for word processing in a variety of languages.  In 1989, his company ceased operations and\nhe became an independent information technology consultant.  In 2000, he started working for \nvarious companies in the information technology field.  He consulted on projects, including for a\n\nTr.24-31; Government Exhibit 1  (Security Clearance Application, dated June 23, 2005); Government Exhibit\n1\n4 (Letter of Commendation, dated August 4, 2004).\nTr. 31-35; 50-52; Applicant Exhibit A (Passport, issued April 18, 1990); Applicant Exhibit E (Adoption Order,\n2\ndated August 16, 2007).\nTr. 97-99.

He has three children from that\nmarriage.  These children were born in the United States, are United States citizens, and  reside in\nthe United States attending college.  He married his present wife in 1997.  They have one child who\nwas born in the United States and is a United States citizen.  The child attends elementary school and\nresides with Applicant and his wife in the United States.  Applicant and his wife recently adopted\nan infant child from an orphanage in Israel.  The adoption has been approved by a United States\ncourt.   His wife is a dual Jordanian and United States citizen.  Her Jordanian citizenship is merely\n2\nbecause she was born in Jordan.  She has a brother who is a resident of the United States and another\nbrother who is a resident of United Arab Emirates.  Applicant and his family have resided in the\nsame house in the United States since 1997.3\nApplicant became a United States citizen in 1990 and issued his first United States passport\nthe next day.  He used this passport in 1995 to take his family to Jordan to visit relatives.  When he\nand the family entered Jordan with United States passports, they had to stand in a long line and pay\na fee.  Applicant also had to report to the local police station after two weeks.  He went to Jordan in\n1996 using his United State passport and encountered the same long line and fee requirement.  He\nalso used the United States passport on various business trips to different countries, like Saudi\nArabia, while marketing his information technology products.   Applicant renewed his United States\n4\npassport in January 2000 and it expires in January 2010.  He used this passport to travel on business\nto Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Canada on business.  He also travel to Mexico and\nCanada for pleasure trips using the passport.   He used his United States passport to enter Israel in\n5\n2005 for the purpose of adopting a child.6\nApplicant is considered by Jordan a Jordanian citizen because he was born in Jordan of\nJordanian parents.  He had a Jordanian passport when he emigrated to the United States.  He renewed\nthe passport in 2000, but never used it.   He was issued a current Jordanian passport on July 12,\n7\n2005, which is to expire on July 12, 2010.   Applicant used the passport twice.  He went to Jordan\n8\nin August 2005 to visit his mother and to bring her back to the United States.  He used the passport\nas a matter of convenience so he did not have to stand in line, pay a fee, or check in with the local\n\nTr. 52-53.\n9\nTr. 78-81, 102-103.\n10\nApplicant Exhibit F (Jordanian instructions and translation, dated December 3, 2007)\n11\nTr. 60-66.\n12\nTr. 67-78; Applicant Exhibit G (Copy Jordanian Passport, July 12, 2005, expiration July112, 2010); Applicant\n13\nExhibit I (Affidavit of Facility Security Officer, and delivery notice, dated December 18, 2007).\nTr. 92.\n14\nTr. 82-83.\n15\n4\npolice.  He used the passport again in April 2007, when he brought his mother back to Jordan.  He\nwanted to make the passage through the Jordanian immigration as easy as possible for his mother.9\nApplicant was interviewed by a security agent in December 2006.  The agent questioned him\nabout his Jordanian passport but did not inform him that possession of a foreign passport was a\nsecurity concern.  In fact, Applicant understood from the agent that there was no issue with his\nJordanian passport.   The first he knew there was an issue was on receiving the SOR.  He contacted\n10\nhis facility security officer and learned the company could not assist him and his only action was to\nreturn the passport to the Jordanian government.  He had a friend contact the Jordanian embassy to\nlearn the procedure to return the Jordanian passport and renounce his Jordanian citizenship.  He did\nnot at first contact them himself because he did not want them to know he was applying for a security\nclearance.  His friend learned that the process to return the passport and renounce the citizenship was\nlong, complicated, and expensive.  Applicant himself contacted the embassy and learned the same\ninformation.  He was directed to an internet site for a form and directions.   The procedures required\n11\nsubmitting the form, paying a $2,000 fee, and waiting for a decision by the Jordanian government.\nAcceptance of the request to renounce Jordanian citizenship is not guaranteed.  Applicant knew the\nEmbassy would not accept his passport for return.  Applicant does not have the $2,000 fee readily\navailable nor the time to wait for a Jordanian government decision.  He stamped the passport\n\u201ccancelled\u201d on his own.   Applicant destroyed the current Jordanian passport in the presence of his\n12\nfacility security officer as a cognizant security authority, and sent the destroyed passport to the\nJordanian Embassy.  Applicant no longer has a current Jordanian passport in his possession.13\nApplicant had seven brothers and sisters.  His father passed away but his mother is still alive.\nHis mother was born in the 1920s in the area that at the time was Palestine.  The area became Jordan\nin the late 1940s.   She is a dual citizen of Canada and Jordan.  She is 86 years old and receives no\n14\nsupport from the Jordanian government.  She does receive benefits from the Canadian government.\nHis brother provides the main support for his mother, and Applicant does not provide support.\nApplicant\u2019s mother lived with Applicant and his family in the United States from 2005 to 2007.  She\nbecame sick in late 2006, and returned to Jordan in April 2007 when strong enough to travel.   \n15\nApplicant\u2019s two sisters and a brother are residents and citizens of Jordan.  One sister and the\nbrother are also dual citizens of Canada.  The sisters are housewives who are not employed outside\nthe home.  One had been a school teacher but is now not employed.  The brother is a medical doctor\nwho is a university professor.  Applicant\u2019s relationship with them is good.  They do not talk every\n\nTr. 56-57, 82-83, 93-94.\n16\nTr. 84-85.\n17\nTr. 92-93.\n18\nTr. 100-101; Government Exhibit 3 (Interrogatories, dated July 17, 2007).

When their mother lived with Applicant in the United States,\nthey talk more frequently.  Now he talks to them only a few times a year, mainly concerning the\nhealth of their mother.   He has a brother who is a dual Jordanian and Canadian citizen residing in\n16\nthe United Arab Emirates.  He is employed by a construction company.  When their mother lived\nwith Applicant, he had frequent contact with the brother by e-mail or telephone when the brother\ninquired about their mother\u2019s health.  Now the contact is very infrequent.  He communicates usually\nover the internet by instant message.  His last contact with the brother was about three months ago.\nApplicant also visited the brother in 2000 when Applicant was in the country on a business trip.17\nApplicant has a brother that is a dual Canadian and Jordanian citizen residing in Saudi\nArabia.  His brother\u2019s wife is the sister of his first wife.  Since he and his first wife divorce, he and\nthis brother are estranged.  At best, his contact with him is by e-mail once a year.   He has a sister\n18\nwho is a resident and citizen of Canada since 1972, and another sister who is a resident and citizen\nof the United States.19\nApplicant does not own any property outside the United States.  He has never voted in a\nforeign election or run for political office in a foreign country.   When he owned his own company,\n20\nhe did some work for an American company that had a contract with a company from Saudi Arabia.\nHe traveled to Saudi Arabia to work on the project in 2000.  He was not a consultant to the Saudi\nArabian government but was a consultant to the United States company.  He also went to Saudi\nArabia in th early 1990s as an employee of another company to attempt to sell a computer program\nto the Saudi Arabian government.  Under the same contract, he worked with Saudi Arabian military\nofficers at the embassy on a computer network.  The highest embassy official he worked with was\na military attache.21\nAn Applicant witness testified he holds a security clearance and worked closely with\nApplicant for over four years from 1999 to 2003.  He was a company vice-president and Applicant\nworked closely with him on a project that lasted a few years.  They traveled extensively together on\nthis project.  He does not know Applicant socially.  Applicant has an excellent reputation for honesty\nand integrity.  He has seen and talked to Applicant since they both left their former employer.22\nAn Applicant witness, a retired military officer, testified he is a vice president of Applicant\u2019s\n\nTr. 113-120.\n23\nTr. 121-126.\n24\nSee Government Exhibit 6 (Background notes, Saudi Arabia, dated June 2007); Saudi Arabia,( Country Report\n25\non Human Rights Practices, 2006); Department of State (Country Report on Terrorism, Chapter 2, Middle East and North\nAfrica Overview, dated April 30, 2007)..\n6\npresent employer.  He has known Applicant for over two years, has frequent exchanges with him,\nand receives reports from other managers.  Applicant is a very trustworthy, honest, and a direct\nindividual.  He works hard, is dedicated to achieving the goals, and goes above and beyond what is\nrequired.  He is confident that Applicant is trustworthy and honest.23\nAnother Applicant witness testified she is the functional lead on a project for Applicant\u2019s\nemployer.  She has worked with Applicant on the project for over two years.  She interacts with him\non a daily basis.  They work closely developing, testing, and implementing the system they designed.\nApplicant is always honest, hard working, and performs the tasks needed to be done.  Applicant\u2019s\nreputation for integrity and honesty with her and his fellow employees is very positive.24\nJordan is a small constitutional monarchy in the Middle East with a developing economy.\nThe government follows a pro-western foreign policy and has had close relationships with the United\nStates for over 40 years.  There are human rights problems and torture by police and security forces.\nJordanian law applies to dual Jordanian and American citizens.  Jordan has aggressively pursued\nterrorists and takes a firm stance against terrorist.  However, the threat from terrorists remains high.\nTerrorists target areas frequented by westerners.  The Jordanian security forces have disrupted\nnumerous plots against United States interests.  However, there is a continued focus by terrorists\nagainst United States and Jordan. \nSaudi Arabia is a monarchy ruled Middle East country.  There are no political parties or\nelections.  There are significant human rights problems.  The religious police harass and abuse\nindividuals to comply with religious actions and customs.  However, Saudi Arabia and the United\nStates share a common concern over regional security.  The United States relationship with Saudi\nArabia was strained after September 11, 2001, because the overwhelming majority of terrorists that\nday were from Saudi Arabia.  There have been other terrorists attacks against United States citizens\nsince 2001.  This required the State Department to issue a travel warning for Saudi Arabia because\nof the terrorist activities targeted against American citizens and interest.  Saudi Arabia believes in\nfighting terrorism in its own country, has taken steps to curtail terrorist and terror plans within its\nborders, and has had some successes.25\nThe United Arab Emirates is a federation of individual ruled emirates.  The government is\na federal republic with a president and council of ministers.  Its laws and practices come from\nIslamic ideals and beliefs.  The country is one of the leading partners in the region against terrorism,\nproviding military , diplomatic and financial assistance.  The United States and United Arab\nEmirates have enjoyed a friendly relationship since the Emirates were established.  There are\nhuman rights problems due to lack of elections, a questionably independent judiciary, and\n\nSee Government Exhibit 8, (Background Notes, United Arab Emirates, June 2007).  It should also be noted\n26\nthat Department counsel initially noted Israel as a country of concern. The government no longer considers Israel a\nsecurity concern.

Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility\nfor access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in the Directive \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An Administrative\nJudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available\nreliable information about the person,.  An administrative Judge should consider: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nof recurrence.30\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\n\nSee Exec.

It is merely\n31\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.32\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.

I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.   Applicant became a United States citizen in 1990, but is\n38\nconsidered by Jordan a citizen of that country because of his birth in Jordan.  He received a United\nStates passport when he became a United States citizen.  He used this passport on his travels, including\ntravels to Jordan,  except as noted below.  Applicant twice renewed his Jordanian passport after\n\nAG \u00b6 6.\n39\n9\nobtaining United States citizenship.  He possessed and used that passport to enter Jordan in 2005 and\n2007. Possession and use of the Jordanian passport raises Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition\n(FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) (Exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes\nbut is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport.)  \nApplicant did not know that possession and use of the passport was a security concern until\nhe received the SOR.  Thereafter, he became aggressive in attempting to denounce his dual citizenship\nwith Jordan and relinquish his Jordanian passport.  He presented information and evidence that he\ninformed officials in the Jordanian embassy of his desire to renounce his citizenship.  He destroyed\nthe passport in front of a cognizant security official from his employer and sent it to the Jordanian\nembassy.  He mitigated the security concerns for foreign preference under Foreign Preference\nMitigating Conditions (FP MC) \u00b6 11(b) (The individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship), and FP MC \u00b6 11(e) (The passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.)  He no longer has a current Jordanian passport.  He took\nthe necessary step to renounce his Jordanian citizenship and destroying his Jordanian passport.\nApplicant has mitigated security concerns for foreign preference.\nUnder Guideline B, foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the United States interest, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.39\nApplicant\u2019s mother, a sister, and a brother are dual citizens of Canada and Jordan and reside\nin Jordan.  He also has a sister who is a citizen and resident of Jordan.  He has two brothers that are\ndual citizens of Jordan and Canada, one residing in Saudi Arabia, and the other in the United Arab\nEmirates.  He visited Jordan in 2005 and 2007 for pleasure, and traveled on business to Saudi Arabia\nand the United Arab Emirates in 2000.  Appellant\u2019s relatives who are citizens and residents of Jordan,\nhis brothers in Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates, and his travels to see them raises Foreign\nInfluence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(a) (Contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion).  Since each individual contact or activity by itself may or may not create a heightened risk\nof foreign influence, the totality of the contacts must be considered to determine if there may be a\nheightened risk of foreign influence.\nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s family in Jordan causes security concerns, I considered that\nJordan has enjoyed friendly relations with the United States for many years.  I also considered that\nthere are human rights violations and concerns because of the actions of police and security forces.\nIn determining if his brother in Saudi Arabia causes a security concern, I considered that the United\n\n10\nStates and Saudi Arabia share a common concern for regional security in the Middle East and there\nare significant human rights concern.  As for the security concern for his brother in the United Arab\nEmirates, I considered that the United States has a long history of friendly relations with the country\nsince its founding.  I also considered the threat of terrorism and terrorist activity in each country.\nThere is no doubt that terrorists are active in each country and there have been terrorists activities\ntargeting western and United States interest.  However, these are general terrorist actions, like suicide\nbombings and shootings, that did not target specific individuals but are just meant to kill any person\nthat happened to be in an area.  Each country has been active in fighting terrorism in their countries\nand have had some successes.  Each country also cooperates with the United States in fighting\nterrorism and terrorist groups.  While terrorists in general will target individuals to obtain intelligence\nagainst the United States, there have been no reported instances of citizens of any of these countries\nbeing specifically targeted by terrorists for intelligence purposes.  While none of these considerations\nby themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered in determining Applicant\u2019s\nvulnerability to pressure or coercion from his family members in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United\nArab Emirates.\nApplicant raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) \u00b6 8(c) (Contacts and\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation) as to his brother in Saudi Arabia.  Applicant\nhas little if any contact with this brother because of his divorce from his first wife who is the sister of\nhis brother\u2019s wife.  The contact is very infrequent by e-mail and the strained relationship does not\ncreate a likelihood of creating a risk for foreign exploitation of Applicant through his brother.\nApplicant has mitigated the security concern for this brother because his contact with the brother is\ninfrequent and casual.  His contacts with his mother and siblings in Jordan and his brother in the\nUnited Arab Emirates are more frequent and are normal for a family.  They are not casual and\ninfrequent, therefore, this mitigating condition does not apply to these family members.\nAs for the family members in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, Applicant has raised\nForeign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (The nature of the relationship with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons\nin that country are such that is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe United States).  Applicant\u2019s mother, brother, and one sister are dual Canadian and Jordanian\ncitizens residing in Jordan.  His other sister is a Jordanian citizen residing in Jordan.  His brother is\na dual Canadian and Jordanian citizen residing in the United Arab Emirates.  His mother is elderly and\nin poor health.  His sisters are housewives and his brother in Jordan is a university professor.  His\nbrother in the United Arab Emirates works in construction.  None ever worked for any foreign\ngovernment.  Applicant\u2019s contact with them is usually by e-mail with occasional telephone calls.  He\ndid see his siblings when he accompanied his mother on her return to Jordan in April 2007.  While\nthere is terrorism in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, it is not of a high intensity or specifically\ntargeting people like his family members.  The level and type of terrorist activity does not cause a\nsecurity concern for Applicant and his family members.  The family members\u2019 living conditions, life\nstyle, and professions, and his limited contact with them show it is unlikely Applicant will be placed\nin a position to choose between the interests of his family and the interests of the United States.\nApplicant has met his burden to establish that his family in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates do\nnot present a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nThey are ordinary citizens leading normal lives which also does not indicating a heightened risk for\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a) applies.\n\n11\nApplicant raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.) \nApplicant left the Middle East to come to the United States for a better education.  He has been here\nfor over half his life, raised a family here, and been successful.  His sense of loyalty is to the United\nStates and the life he has established for himself.  His sense of obligation to Jordan is minimal since\nhe renounced his Jordanian dual citizenship and destroyed his passport.  Since becoming a United\nStates citizen, he has used his United States passport for most of his travels thus highlighting his\nUnited States citizenship.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as well as the following factors in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a\nsingle item in isolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  Applicant has family members in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nThese simple facts alone might be sufficient to raise security concerns over Applicant\u2019s vulnerability\nto coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  However, mere family ties with people in a foreign country is\nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  Whether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a\nforeign country poses a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and\ncircumstances of the family ties.  Applicant\u2019s family in Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, both\nindividually and collectively, are in positions and circumstances that make it unlikely Applicant will\nbe placed in a position to choose between the interests of his family and the interest of the United\nStates, or that he can be exploited, pressured, or coerced because of them.  Applicant has been in the\nUnited States for over half his life, and a citizen of the United States for over 17 years.  His co-worker\nand his supervisor consider him to be security conscious and not a security risk. \nApplicant\u2019s life story is an example of the success of many immigrants to the United States.\nHe came to the United States early in his life to better himself through education, and became a United\nStates citizen.  The family enjoys a typical United States life style with his children being educated in\nthe United States.  He visits to  Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have been limited\nand for personal or business reasons rather than any connection to the foreign governments.  He has\nestablished that his motivation for his contacts and activities with his family in Jordan, Saudi Arabia,\nand the United Arab Emirates do not indicate a security risk.  He has renounced his Jordanian\ncitizenship and destroyed his Jordanian passport.  \nThe general threat of terrorism in and of itself does not cause a security concern.  There is a\ngeneral threat of terrorism and terrorist activity throughout the world, including in the United States.\nThe countries involved are actively fighting terrorists and have succeeded in stopping some terrorist\nactivities.  In Jordan and the United Arab Emirates, there is a general threat and not a specific threat\ntargeting terrorism of Applicant\u2019s family members.  Applicant has presented sufficient information to\nmitigate any security concerns under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I conclude Applicant is eligible for\naccess to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n12\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 7, \n2005. On September 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 2, 2007, which was \nreceived at DOHA on October 7, 2007. She answered the SOR in writing on October \n22, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the \nrequest on October 29, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nNovember 30, 2007, and I received the case assignment on December 6, 2007. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on December 17, 2007, scheduling the hearing on January \n10, 2008. Subsequent to that notice of hearing being issued, Applicant requested \nadditional time to prepare for her hearing. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay, and \nscheduled the hearing for January 24, 2008.  \n \nOn the day of her hearing, Applicant telephonically informed me that she had \nbeen selected for jury duty and was summoned for service that same day. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled. Applicant was not present. Over Department Counsel\u2019s \nobjection, I continued the hearing to a later date. See transcript of hearing for the \nJanuary 24, 2008 session, which DOHA received on January 30, 2008. On January 28, \n2008, Applicant submitted documentation from the court clerk indicating her jury duty \nsummons included service from January 22, 2008 through January 25, 2008. Exhibit I. \nOn January 25, 2008, DOHA issued a third notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for \nFebruary 14, 2008. The hearing was held as rescheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which \nwere received without objection, and she testified on her own behalf. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 27, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.d., 1.i., 1.j., \n1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old administrative assistant, who has been employed by a \nfederal contractor since January 2004. She is a first-time applicant for a security \nclearance. She attended secretarial school from September 1981 to June 1982, and \nwas awarded a Certificate of Completion and her GED in June 1982. Tr. 85-86. \n \nApplicant was married from December 1982 to October 2003. Her marriage \nended by divorce. She has three children, a 24-year-old daughter, a 16-year-old son, \nand a six-year-old daughter. She has been a single mother since her divorce and is not \nreceiving child support for her two minor children.  \n \nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, which are ongoing. The \nSOR alleges sixteen separate debts, ranging from $25 to $3,672 for a total of about \n$13,221. The Government established by substantial evidence the ten debts that she \ndenied. Applicant\u2019s adverse financial history was clearly established by a judgment filed \nin July 2001 and four separate credit reports from June 2006, April 2007, June 2007, \nand November 2007. GE 2 through 6.   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from her job in September 2001 and remained unemployed \nuntil January 2004, when she started her present job.   \n \nApplicant recently sought the services of a bankruptcy attorney. She submitted a \ncopy of her attorney retainer agreement, dated February 12, 2007, and accompanying \ndocumentation that reflects she made a down payment of $400 towards her attorney fee \nof $1,000. AE A through D. The bankruptcy process has not had time to evolve to \nresolve any of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Applicant stated she earns approximately \n$42k a year, and at the end of the month she has a net remainder of \u201c[n]ormally, at least \nabout 100-200 dollars.\u201d Tr. 91-95. \n \nApplicant has been unable to repay any of the debts alleged in the SOR or \notherwise resolve her indebtedness. Nine of the debts were for medical bills and most of \nthe remaining debts were for credit cards. Applicant incurred most of her debts during \nher period of unemployment. Since Applicant began her current job in January 2004, \nshe has not resolved any of her debts. Other than the attorney retainer agreement and \naccompanying documentation, Applicant presented no documentary information of \nefforts taken to pay or otherwise resolve her debts. At her hearing, she stated that she \nintended to initiate the required pre-bankruptcy counseling \u201cnext week.\u201d Tr. 80. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated over $13k of delinquent debt and has been \nunable to pay or resolve those debts since 2000. The record evidence is more than \nsufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. Also, the record evidence \nsupports a conclusion of financial irresponsibility. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial troubles began about 2000 and are ongoing. They are primarily attributable to \nher period of unemployment, however, that unemployment ended four years ago. Also, \nher lack of child support is a factor, and some of her delinquent debts are unreimbursed \nmedical bills. She claims her medical bills were covered by health care insurance; \nhowever, she has not followed up on these medical bills. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,1 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact \ncreditors, or to resolve any of the debts since she acquired them. Nor is there any \nevidence that she has participated in any financial counseling. I specifically considered \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) Guidelines \u00b6 20(b): The \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances, and conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony fails to establish mitigating factors that may \nbe considered as circumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay \nher debts. She was unemployed from September 2001 until January 2004, she received \nsporadic child support, and the father of her child provided limited financial contributions \nto the household. These claims demonstrate circumstances beyond her control; \nhowever, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly with \nher financial obligations. She presented little evidence to show she dealt responsibly \nwith her financial obligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid \ndebts, settlements, documented negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial \nassistance/counseling). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack of favorable evidence \npreclude a finding that she has established a track record of financial responsibility, or \nthat she has taken control of his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, \nher financial problems are likely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, her financial \nproblems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing.  \n \nApplicant presented little in the way of favorable information, and her good \nintentions and future plans are not sufficient evidence to overcome the security concern \nraised by the Government\u2019s evidence. At this point, it is likely that her history of financial \nproblems will continue. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \n \n1  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.p.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on January 26, 2006. On October 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s \nsecurity concern under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).1  \n \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJune 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                     \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 4, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2008. The \nfirst Notice of Hearing was issued on January 11, 2008, convening a hearing on \nFebruary 6, 2008. Applicant requested two continuances due to the unavailability of his \nexpert witness (Tr. 15-17). The final Notice of Hearing was issued on February 11, \n2008, convening a hearing on February 25, 2008. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government presented eight exhibits, marked GE 1-8, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented 8 \nexhibits, marked AE 1-8, which were admitted without objection.2 DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 4, 2008. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nThe Government withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.h. Section 1072 of the Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181, signed on January 28, 2008), repealed \n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, formerly known as the \u201cSmith Amendment\u201d (Tr. 22). \n \nThe Government moved to amend the second sentence of SOR \u00b6 1.e, by \ndeleting the date \u201cJune 10,\u201d and substituting the date \u201cFebruary 6.\u201d Applicant did not \nobject. I granted the motion (Tr. 22-23).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in all the \nSOR allegations, except SOR \u00b6 1.h, which he failed to answer. I considered this last \nallegation denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n  \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior management consultant, working as an \nindependent contractor, for a government contractor. He completed a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Wildlife Biology in 1974, and his Master of Arts in Management and \nHuman Relations in 1990 (GE 1, Tr. 6). He also graduated from the Army Command \nand General Staff College in 1987.  \n \n \nApplicant served as an officer in the U.S. Army from 1975 to 1994. He was \nadministratively discharged in 1994 because of misconduct. His service was \ncharacterized as \u201cunder other than honorable conditions\u201d. He testified his \ncharacterization of service has been upgraded to honorable (Tr. 128). While in the \nArmy, Applicant had access to classified information at the secret level from 1975 to \n1987, and at the top secret level from 1987 to 1992.  \n \n \n2  AE 1 was admitted at the hearing. Applicant attached AE 2 - 8 to his answer to the SOR. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to me considering the documents and I made them made part of the \nrecord (Tr. 19-20). \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since \nNovember 2000. The vice president and president of his company have known and \nworked with Applicant for approximately nine years. They endorsed Applicant\u2019s \nclearance without hesitation. A friend/colleague also endorsed Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance without reservations. His references attest to Applicant\u2019s dedication, \nreliability, integrity, ethics, and the quality of his work. Applicant is considered a highly \nskilled employee, who is articulate and intelligent, and who loves the military and its \nmission. While working for his current employer, he has been placed in positions of \nresponsibility over mission essential tasks and sensitive matters. He has consistently \nperformed in an outstanding manner. They are all aware that Applicant was convicted of \na felony. However, there is no indication in their letters as to whether they are aware of \nthe heinous nature of the sexual offenses Applicant committed (AEs 5, 6, and 7). \n \nApplicant married his wife in 1986, and she divorced him in 1997. They have four \ndaughters (age 30, 28, 16, and 14) and one son (age 12) born of this marriage (GE 1, \nTr. 141-144).  \n \nCriminal Conduct Allegations \n \n \nIn 1975, Applicant was arrested for window peeping, and was forced to post a \nbond. The charge was later dismissed. In 1979, he was arrested for window peeping \nand charged with disorderly conduct. He posted a $200 bond. In 1982, he was arrested \nand charged with disorderly conduct. He posted a $21 bond and the charge was later \ndismissed. During his freshman year at college, Applicant used binoculars to view into \nthe rooms of female students (GE 5).  \n \nIn April 1992, Applicant exposed himself to a female and fled the area on foot. He \nwas pursued and drove away in his car. He was identified and charged with indecent \nexposure. His case was place on a Stet Docket (GE 3). Applicant blamed his \nmisconduct on his alcohol dependence and the fact that he had been drinking the day of \nthe incident. Because Applicant was an officer (major) in the Army and had access to \nclassified information, the Army Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility ordered \nApplicant\u2019s mental health evaluation. In February 1993, an Army psychiatrist diagnosed \nApplicant as (1) alcohol dependent, in remission and (2) Voyeurism and Exhibitionism \n(provisional), remission uncertain. In his findings and recommendations, the \ndoctor/psychiatrist noted: \n \nThe diagnoses of Voyeurism and Exhibitionism (provisional), generally \nrepresent chronic psychiatric problems which do not resolve without major \npsychiatric interventions or changed life circumstances. Even with \ntreatment, these disorders have a high relapse rate. Given the chronic \nnature of these disorders and the tendency of patients with these \nproblems to deny on-going voyeurism and exhibitionism, it is the judgment \nof the undersigned that [Applicant] possesses poor judgment in the area of \nsexuality which may compromise his reliability. Continued psychotherapy \nis strongly advised. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nGE 5 at 18. \n \n \nApplicant underwent residential alcohol treatment from November to December \n1992. At the end of his treatment, his prognosis was considered good; however, he was \nrequired to attend another year of after care treatment. From 1992 to 1995, he averred \nhe participated in Alcoholic Anonymous and Sexual Compulsive Anonymous meetings \n(Tr. 122). He claimed he did well after attending AA for two years. Because of the above \nmentioned misconduct and psychiatric evaluation, in April 1994, Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance was revoked and his SCI access was withdrawn (GE 5).  \n \n \nBetween 1991 and 1995, Applicant sexually molested three of his four daughters \nand four of his daughters\u2019 young girlfriends (Tr. 135). Specifically, in 1991, he sexually \nfondled, allegedly over the top of her clothes, his then 12-year-old daughter. He also \nsexually fondled his then 11-year-old daughter, twice during a one-month period. \nMoreover, Applicant inserted his penis in the vagina of his then six-month-old daughter \n(Tr. 135-136, 141-145).  \n \n \nIn 1995, his older daughter was having emotional and mental problems which \nrequired her to receive mental counseling. She disclosed to her counselor and her \nmother that Applicant was sexually molesting her and that it had happened before. As a \nresult, Applicant was charged with Aggravated Sexual Battery and Indecent Liberties \nwith Children, both felony offenses. In February 1997, Applicant was convicted of both \nfelony offenses. He was sentenced to five years jail (suspended), and 20 years \nsupervised probation on the Indecent Liberties charge. On the Aggravated Sexual \nBattery charge, he was sentenced to 15 years jail (suspended), and 20 years \nsupervised probation.  \n \n \nIn March 1997, Applicant consumed alcoholic beverages and exposed himself to \na female in a library. In June 1997, he was convicted of obscene display and sentenced \nto six months jail of which he served three months. His behavior violated the conditions \nof his 20-year-probation resulting from his February 1997 conviction for Aggravated \nSexual Battery and Indecent Liberties. In November 1997, Applicant\u2019s 20-year-probation \nwas revoked and he was sentenced to five years jail. He served two and one-half years \nin a correctional facility and was placed on 15 years supervised probation, starting from \nhis release from jail. He is a registered sex offender. \n \nApplicant has been in therapy/counseling since his release from jail. He initially \nparticipated in a sexual offenders\u2019 treatment group. Afterwards, he was referred to \nindividual counseling, and has continued his counseling to the hearing date. Applicant\u2019s \ncounselor believes Applicant is doing well, and he is satisfied with Applicant\u2019s progress. \nTo the counselor\u2019s knowledge, Applicant has not relapsed since 1996. In the \ncounselor\u2019s opinion, \u201cthere has been rehabilitation of the presenting compulsivity issues \nand the probability of re-offense is low based on the client\u2019s history of compliance with \ntreatment and probation and the [Applicant\u2019s] ability to receive insight and make \npersona intrinsic changes\u201d (AE 4). The counselor stated he would trust Applicant with \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nhis own daughters (Tr. 71). Additionally, Applicant has participated in AA and Sexual \nCompulsive Anonymous (SCA) continuously to the hearing date. \n \nApplicant\u2019s probation/parole officer confirmed that in February 1997, Applicant \nwas sentenced to an indefinite term of supervised probation. In the parole officer\u2019s \nopinion, Applicant has adjusted well to supervision. Applicant has maintained an open \nand honest line of communication with the probation office, and has not received \nsanctions for any type of violations. He has worked diligently on his treatment, and is \naware of the lifelong commitment it takes to overcome his offending triggers (AE 4).  \n \nApplicant claimed the first time he realized he had a deviant sexual behavior \nproblem was after he was indicted by his daughter in 1995. Before that incident, he had \nworked on his alcohol dependence problem, but not on his sexual deviancy problems. \nHe expressed remorse, regret, and guilt for his past deviant sexual behavior, and \nlamented the necessity of losing his family and being incarcerated to cause him to \nrealize he had to change (Tr. 105-109). Applicant averred he has not consumed \nalcoholic beverages or engaged in any sexual misconduct since 1997. \n \nApplicant testified that, notwithstanding his heinous past sexual behavior and \nconviction, he is a man of character and integrity. To support his assertions he relied on \nhis Army record and duty performance while in the service and while working for his \ncurrent \nemployer \nduring \nthe \nlast \nnine \nyears. \nHe \nbelieves \nthe \nintensive \ntreatment/counseling programs he has undergone since 1997, have given him the \nnecessary tools to arrest his obsessive compulsive sexual behavior and alcohol \ndependence.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are to be considered in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                     \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nFrom 1975 to 1997, Applicant was involved in six criminal conduct related \nincidents. He was convicted of Aggravated Sexual Battery and Indecent Liberties with a \nMinor in 1997, both felony offenses. The remaining five incidents involved charges for \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n7 \n \n \naberrational sexual behavior. All of Applicant\u2019s offenses occurred while he was serving \nas an officer in the U.S. Army. He sexually abused and/or molested his own three young \ndaughters and four of their girlfriends. After his felony conviction, Applicant was placed \non probation. Within months, Applicant violated the terms of his probation and was \nconvicted of obscene display. Taken together, these incidents show Applicant lacks \njudgment, and raise serious doubts on his ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Criminal Conduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d) \u201cindividual is currently on probation or parole or \nprobation,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(e) \u201cviolation of parole or probation,\u201d apply. \n \n \nAG & 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that \nnone apply. He receives some mitigation because his last criminal related incident \noccurred in 1997, and there is no evidence of additional alcohol related incidents or \ncriminal misconduct for more than 10 years.  \n \n \nNotwithstanding, because of his history of compulsive sexual criminal behavior \nover an extended period of time; the seriousness nature of the offenses; his age, \neducation, and employment at the time of the offenses; the young age of the victims \nand their relationship to Applicant; his violation of probation; the fact that he is still on \nindefinite probation; and the chronic nature of his obsessive compulsive behavior, the \npassage of time, and the extent of his therapy and counseling, are insufficient to \nmitigate his criminal behavior.  \n \n \nApplicant appears to be making progress in his rehabilitation. However, his \nevidence is not sufficient to show that the circumstances that caused his questionable \nbehavior are no longer present in Applicant\u2019s life, and I believe his questionable \nbehavior is likely to recur. Moreover, having observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and \nconsidering his testimony in light of the record evidence, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony \nwas not fully candid and forthright, and that he tried to minimize his questionable \nbehavior. Applicant\u2019s overall behavior cast serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. Although Applicant \nexpressed remorse for his behavior and has initiated changes in his lifestyle, these \nfactors are insufficient to establish his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and \nrehabilitation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, \neducation, maturity level, his 19 years of service, his prior access to classified \ninformation, and his years of good performance for a government contractor. I \nconsidered that he is doing well on his probation, and in his rehabilitation efforts. I also \nconsidered the seriousness of the criminal conduct at issue. On balance, the record \nevidence does not convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was arrested for, and convicted of nine criminal offenses between 1979\nand 2005. He remains on probation from his latest conviction for driving while\nintoxicated (DWI). Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(SF 86), on September 18, 2006. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant\ndetailing security concerns under Guideline J. The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nJune 30, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 15, 2007, but did now indicate\nwhether he requested a hearing before an administrative judge. On October 24, 2007,\nDOHA informed Applicant that he needed to state whether he wished to have a hearing\nin order for his answer to be considered complete. Applicant responded again on\nNovember 6, 2007, indicating that he wished to have the case decided without a\nhearing. After a discussion with Department Counsel, Applicant changed his mind and,\non February 27, 2008, sent an email expressing his desire to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 27,\n2008, and DOHA assigned the case to me on March 20, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 9, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on May 13, 2008. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were also admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 22, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor, for whom he has\nworked for two years. He has never held a security clearance, or been employed in any\ngovernment capacity. He is divorced, with five children, none of whom live with him. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, and during testimony at the hearing, Applicant\nadmitted each of the nine arrests and convictions alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i.\nThe earliest incident took place in June 1979, when he stole a car in order to leave the\nstate in which he was then living. After the car ran out of gas on the highway, he was\narrested and held in jail for three months pending trial. He pled guilty, was convicted\nand sentenced to serve one to five years confinement, suspended, and three years\nprobation. (Tr. at 29-30.)\nApplicant was next arrested in November 1985, and charged with leaving the\nscene of an accident. He had backed his uncle\u2019s large truck into the car that was parked\nbehind the truck as he was leaving the area after picking up a friend at a bar. He\ntestified that he had not realized he hit the car, although his friend told him that he had.\nHe pled guilty to this offense, and was sentenced to 30 days confinement, suspended,\nfined $150, and to serve one year of probation. (Tr. at 31-34.) In January 1987, he was\narrested for DWI while driving home from a bar after a few drinks with the same friend.\nHis blood alcohol content was close to, but over the limit, and he pled guilty. He was\nsentenced to 30 days in jail, with 27 suspended, fined $250, and his driver\u2019s license was\nrevoked. (Tr. at 34-35.) \nDuring 1987, Applicant and his wife were smoking a lot of marijuana. He decided\nto grow his own, rather than purchase it, and stole about $300 worth of peat moss to\nuse while potting the plants. After he was questioned about this by police, they\nsearched his home and found the growing marijuana. This led to the convictions\ndescribed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, for producing marijuana and larceny. He was\n\n3\nsentenced to 15 days in jail on the first charge, and 90 days in jail, with 85 days\nsuspended, on the second charge. (Tr. at 37-42.) During May 1989, he was arrested for\ndriving while his license was suspended (from the earlier DWI). He was convicted and\nsentenced to 40 days in jail, all suspended, fined and given two years of probation. (Tr.\nat 42-43.) All three of these convictions were subsequently set aside by the courts after\nhe successfully served as an undercover informant for police conducting investigations\ninto drug distribution. He became an informant during 1993 to 1995, in return for not\nbeing prosecuted after being caught selling marijuana. (Tr. at 50-53.) \nIn June 1992, he was arrested for assaulting his wife during an argument. He\nwas convicted of disorderly conduct - refusal to disperse, and sentenced to 10 days in\njail, all suspended, fined, placed on one year of probation, and ordered to perform 20\nhours of community service. (Tr. at 43-45.) During January 1998, he was arrested and\ncharged with leaving the scene of an accident after he hit a parked car with a front-\nloader he had been using for snow removal. He was placed on 180 days probation for\nthis conviction, which was also subsequently set aside as a result of his earlier\nundercover police work. (Tr. at 47-51.)\nOn September 30, 2005, Applicant became very intoxicated while drinking a\ncombination of beer and whiskey at his home. He blacked out, and does not remember\nanything except being arrested in his car on the other side of town from where he lives.\nHe has seen police video of the arrest, and he was incoherent. He was convicted of\nDWI again, and sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 87 days suspended, fined $3,000, with\n$1,500 suspended, ordered to complete an alcohol safety program, and placed on three\nyears probation, which will continue until January 2009. His probation is presently\nunsupervised. He completed the alcohol program, but continues to drink alcohol in\nmoderation. (Tr. at 53-58, 69-71.)  \nApplicant submitted three letters from union and company officials, attesting to\nhis consistently outstanding and trustworthy performance of his work responsibilities.\n(AE A, B, and C.) He testified that he is trying to be responsible in his private life as well.\nHe has not smoked marijuana for the past 12 years, and hopes to become a better\nexample for his children. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n\n4\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, including: \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses;\u201d \u201c(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\u201d and \u201c(d) individual is\ncurrently on parole or probation.\u201d All three of these disqualifying conditions are\nestablished in this case, and Applicant\u2019s long and varied criminal history raises\n\n5\nsubstantial doubt about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s crimes 20 or 30 years ago, if viewed in isolation, would create limited\ndoubt about his current reliability and judgement. They do not exist in isolation,\nhowever. His pattern of criminal activity resulted in nine convictions over that 30-year\nperiod, the most recent of which was for a serious DWI incident less that 3 years ago.\nHis absence of new offenses since that date is less indicative of reformation than would\notherwise be the case since he remains on probation with significant suspended\npunishment hanging over his head. \nThe variety and number of crimes involved do not reflect any outside pressure to\nbreak the law, nor could they support a conclusion that criminal behavior is unlikely to\nrecur. Applicant did present evidence of a recent good employment record, but that too\noccurred during his period of probation. While Applicant has done just about everything\nthat he could have done since his last DWI incident in 2005, insufficient time has\npassed to support significant mitigation under any of these mitigating conditions. The\nsetting aside of the convictions set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h took place in\nreturn for Applicant\u2019s undercover police work, not because he did not actually commit\nany of those offenses. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves substantial criminal conduct resulting in nine convictions for major and\nminor offenses over the past 30 years, with the most recent less than 3 years ago.\nApplicant is a mature, experienced adult who is accountable for his decisions and\nconduct. He remains on probation, so his recent absence of arrests is less probative of\ntrue reform than might otherwise be the case.\nApplicant\u2019s extensive pattern precludes any conclusion that continuation or\nrecurrence is unlikely. Applicant\u2019s good reputation at work and within his union is\ncommendable, but insufficient in itself to mitigate security concerns arising from his\nconduct. His record reflects a consistent inability or unwillingness to follow laws, rules\nand regulations, together with significant lapses of judgment.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his numerous and varied criminal acts\nover the past 30 years. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\ncriminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.       \n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is a single man, originally from Sudan, who is seeking to work for a defense contractor as an Arabic translator. He obtained a translator certification in March 2004 (Exhibit 6). Applicant was born and raised in a \u201cmudhouse\u201d in a remote village in western Sudan that lacked sewage, electricity, and running water (Tr. 88). Because Sudan is underdeveloped, it has no accurate method of tracking the identity and age of citizens such as Applicant who were born in rural areas. When children begin primary school, the government assigns them an estimated age (Tr. 53). Therefore, Applicant\u2019s age, listed as 54, is an approximation. School attendance in Sudan after primary school is a privilege. Students must earn admission into successive schools. Because Applicant\u2019s province had few schools, the admissions process was highly competitive. Applicant, a stellar student, was accepted into intermediate school, high school, and college (Tr. 92). In 1978, after earning a bachelor of laws at the state university, he began working as a high school teacher in Sudan. He then worked for the Sudanese judiciary as an associate judge/assistant legal advisor in 1979. Later in 1979, Applicant emigrated to Yemen, and began working as an elementary school teacher. Then, he moved to Saudi Arabia where he worked as a translator and legal assistant for a law firm. He then moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). and worked as ",

The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 26, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on December 3, 2007.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 21, 2007, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on January 23, 2008. During the hearing, I received three government\nexhibits, two Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. Also, at the government\u2019s\nrequest, I took administrative notice of the facts listed in 10 source documents\nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n2\nconcerning the Republic of Sudan. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record\nopen at Applicant\u2019s request for him to submit additional documents. Within the time\nallotted, he submitted three additional documents. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on February 1, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is a single man,\noriginally from Sudan, who is seeking to work for a defense contractor as an Arabic\ntranslator. He obtained a translator certification in March 2004 (Exhibit 6). \nApplicant was born and raised in a \u201cmudhouse\u201d in a remote village in western\nSudan that lacked sewage, electricity, and running water (Tr. 88). Because Sudan is\nunderdeveloped, it has no accurate method of tracking the identity and age of citizens\nsuch as Applicant who were born in rural areas. When children begin primary school,\nthe government assigns them an estimated age (Tr. 53). Therefore, Applicant\u2019s age,\nlisted as 54, is an approximation.\nSchool attendance in Sudan after primary school is a privilege. Students must\nearn admission into successive schools. Because Applicant\u2019s province had few schools,\nthe admissions process was highly competitive. Applicant, a stellar student, was\naccepted into intermediate school, high school, and college (Tr. 92). In 1978, after\nearning a bachelor of laws at the state university, he began working as a high school\nteacher in Sudan. He then worked for the Sudanese judiciary as an associate\njudge/assistant legal advisor in 1979.\nLater in 1979, Applicant emigrated to Yemen, and began working as an\nelementary school teacher. Then, he moved to Saudi Arabia where he worked as a\ntranslator and legal assistant for a law firm. He then moved to the United Arab Emirates\n(UAE). and worked as a court commissioner and an investigator (Tr. 62).\nIn 1981, Applicant emigrated to the United States to attend graduate school. He\nretained no connections with anyone from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, or UAE after leaving\nthese countries. By 1986, he had earned a master\u2019s degree and a doctorate in public\nadministration (Tr. 93). \nHe has published several articles on subjects in his field. Also, he is a member of\nthe American Society of Public Administration (Exhibit 3 at 4).\nIn 1987, Applicant began working as a chaplain for a state prison system. He\nprimarily focused on counseling Muslim inmates. Also, he managed the prison\u2019s budget\nfor religious items (Exhibit 3 at 2), served as a liaison for chaplains of any denomination\nwho worked at the prison (Tr. 97), and taught courses to prisoners. He has also served\nover the years as an adjunct professor at a local university (Tr. 100). \n\n3\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1996 (Exhibit 3 at 1, Tr. 54). He\nretired from the prison system on disability in 2000, and receives a state pension\n(Exhibit 1 at 10, Tr. 97).\nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, and three sisters are citizens and residents of\nSudan. His father is deceased. They live in rural, adjoining villages in western Sudan\n(Tr. 55). None of their homes has electricity, sewage, telephones, or running water (Tr.\n88). He talks to his mother once every three to six months (Tr. 76), and sends her\n$1,000 per year (Answer at 3, Tr. 66). She is elderly and in poor health. Until her health\ndeteriorated, she was a subsistence farmer (Tr. 69). He last visited her in 2005 when\nher medical condition required hospitalization (Tr. 65).\nApplicant\u2019s brother is an accounting clerk for a Sudanese government agency\n(Tr. 71). They have not seen one another since 1992. Applicant last talked to him in\n2005 when he returned home to visit (Tr. 78).\nApplicant\u2019s oldest sister is a homemaker. He last saw her during his 2005 visit.\nOn average, he talks to her approximately once per year (Tr. 80). Most recently, he\ncalled her six months ago to offer condolences after her husband was ambushed and\nmurdered by a rival ethnic group (Tr. 80).\nApplicant\u2019s next oldest sister is a subsistence farmer, and his youngest sister is a\nprimary school teacher. He visited them during his 2005 Sudan visit. He has spoken\nwith them once since then (Tr. 81). \nCommunication between Applicant and his family is difficult. None have land\nphone lines, and although many of his relatives now own cell phones, they are\nunreliable in Sudan (Tr. 73). Most often when he talks to them, they have to travel from\ntheir village to a general store to call him, or he must leave a message with the store\nproprietor who will tell them to return his call (Tr. 89). Applicant wires the money he\nsends to his mother through the community general store, also.\nApplicant\u2019s stepmother, two half-brothers, and six half-sisters are also Sudanese\ncitizens and residents. They live in a more modern town than his full siblings and his\nmother (Tr. 83). His stepmother is elderly and does not work. He talks to her\napproximately once every three to six months. One of the half-brothers and two of the\nhalf-sisters are primary school teachers (Tr. 72). Three half-sisters are homemakers,\nand the remaining half-siblings are recent college graduates (Tr. 74, 85). Since visiting\nSudan in 2005, he has spoken to them once when, on his half-brother\u2019s wedding day,\nhe called to offer congratulations (Tr. 85).\nApplicant traveled to Sudan to visit relatives in 1983, 1992, 1997, and 2005. (Tr.\n68). These four visits and the sporadic phone conversations constitute the only forms of\ncommunication in which Applicant has engaged his relatives since leaving in 1981.\nNone of his relatives have visited him in the U.S., and he has no assets in Sudan\n(Exhibit 2 at 6, 15).\n\n4\nSudan is a poor country with a population of 40 million people. Its transportation\ninfrastructure extends to only one tenth of one percent of the country (Exhibit I at 1, 7),\nand its foreign debt exceeds its gross domestic product (Exhibit I at 8). Most rural\ntowns, streets, and buildings do not carry names, numbers, addresses or signs (Exhibit\n2 at 15).\nThe central government is located in northern Sudan. It is a repressive regime\nwhich brutally restricts civil liberties, frequently harassing minority ethnic groups,\nconducting \nsurveillance \nin \nschools, \nuniversities, \nmarkets, \nworkplaces, \nand\nneighborhoods, and monitoring e-mail. Examples of human rights violations include\ntorture, prolonged pre-trial detention, executive interference with the judiciary, and\nforced labor (Exhibit V at 1).\nSudan\u2019s northern and southern regions fought a civil war for nearly 30 years\n(Exhibit I at 3, 4). In 2003, with international help, they negotiated a peace agreement.\nSeveral militias from both sides of the conflict have refused to acknowledge it (Exhibit I\nat 6). They have continued to randomly brutalize civilians and harass their former\nopponents (Exhibit V at 11).\nAt or about the time northern and southern Sudan were negotiating a peace\nagreement, conflict arose between minority tribal groups and government-backed\nmilitias in Darfur, a province in western Sudan (Exhibit I at 5). With the central\ngovernment\u2019s support, the militias murdered thousands of minority tribe members, and\ndisplaced more than two million others (Exhibit V at 1). \nSudan\u2019s borders are porous. Sudanese citizens have been subjected to random\nattacks from border-crossing rebel groups and bandits from adjacent countries (Exhibit\nII at 2).\nHistorically, terrorists have operated in Sudan with impunity. This compelled the\nU.S. in 1993 to designate Sudan a state sponsor of terrorism (Exhibit VII at 2). In 1997,\nPresident Clinton, citing Sudan\u2019s \u201ccontinued support for international terrorism, ongoing\nefforts to destabilize neighboring governments, and the prevalence of human rights\nviolations,\u201d declared Sudan to be an extraordinary threat to the national security and\nforeign policy of the U.S., and signed Executive Order 13067 imposing sanctions\n(Exhibit IX).\nSince 9/11, Sudan has taken significant steps to cooperate in the War on Terror,\naggressively pursuing threats to U.S. interests (Exhibit VII at 1, 2). The threat of\nindiscriminate terrorist attacks on U.S. interests in Sudan remains (Exhibit III). Because\nof the Sudanese government\u2019s continuing violation of human rights, \u201cparticularly with\nrespect to the conflict in Darfur, where the Government of Sudan exercises\nadministrative and legal authority and pervasive practical influence . . . .,\u201d President\nBush extended U.S. sanctions in 2006 (Exhibit X at 1).\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nan individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interests\u201d (AG \u00b6\n\n6\n6). Here, Applicant worked in Yemen, Saudi Arabia and the UAE nearly 30 years ago\nbefore emigrating to the U.S. He retains no contacts with anyone from these countries.\nHis prior residence in those countries does not create a foreign influence security\nconcern.\nConversely, Sudan is a brutally repressive country that is a haven for warlords,\nmilitias, bandits, and terrorists. The presence of Applicant\u2019s relatives there, and his\ncontacts with them generates a security concern under AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, or coercion.\u201d\nApplicant last talked to his brother when he visited Sudan in 2005. Before that\nvisit, he had not seen him since 1992. He has only spoken to his other siblings and half-\nsiblings once since the 2005 visit, and does not correspond with them in any other\nmanner. AG \u00b6 8(c),\u201d contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation,\u201d applies to these relatives.\nApplicant sends his mother money and talks to her and his stepmother\napproximately once every three to six months. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply to these\nrelationships.\nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for 27 years, more than half his adult life. In that\ntime, he has earned a Ph.D, published scholarly works, and periodically taught college\nstudents. He currently receives a pension from a state civil service job where he worked\nfor 13 years before retiring. He has no assets in Sudan, and has only visited four times\nsince emigrating to the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cThere is no conflict of interest, either because\nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government,\nor country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n7\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nSudan is a repressive, underdeveloped country controlled by an autocratic\ngovernment that is either unable or unwilling to project its authority throughout its\ngeographic boundaries. It has an extremely limited communications and transportation\ninfrastructure, particularly in rural areas. \nApplicant\u2019s relatives live in remote, rural areas far from the government\u2019s nexus\nof power. Many of them live in homes located on unnamed streets without electricity,\nphone service, or running water. Although the Sudanese government has little respect\nfor the individual rights of its citizens, the possibility that it will identify and target\nApplicant\u2019s relatives in order to exploit them is limited by the lack of infrastructure\nnecessary to do so. \nMany of the areas where the Sudanese government\u2019s power is weakest are\ncontrolled by ethnic strongmen, bandits, terrorists, and militias, all of whom have\nbrutalized civilians in the past. Because of the volatile nature of these groups, the\nSudanese hinterlands are in a state of nearly constant armed conflict. Under these\ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s relatives are more likely to be killed indiscriminately than\nused against him as tools of coercion. Upon evaluating this case in the context of the\nwhole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S. developed throughout the 27 years since he emigrated here outweigh the risk\nof coercion posed by his relatives living in Sudan. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a\ntrustworthiness designation.  On August 31, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR)\n\n2\nadvising Applicant of the basis for that decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)\n(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On January 23,  2008, after\nconsidering the record, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\ntrustworthiness designation.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nThe Board construes Applicant\u2019s appeal as alleging that the Judge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness\ndetermination is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts, totaling $13,258, for such\nthings as credit card accounts, medical bills, and unpaid traffic tickets.  Applicant denied owing\ncertain of the debts, though the Judge found that her denials were not corroborated.  Applicant had\nnot consulted with a credit counseling service.  The Judge considered various mitigating conditions\nbut concluded that none were sufficient to justify granting a trustworthiness designation.  In his\nwhole person analysis the Judge stated that \u201cApplicant has not taken any action to resolve her\nfinancial issues.  Her promise to pay her debts in the future is not sufficient to mitigate\u201d the\ntrustworthiness concerns raised by her financial problems.  Decision at 6.  \nExamining Applicant\u2019s appeal in light of the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the\nJudge has articulated \u201ca satisfactory explanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational\nconnection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse trustworthiness determination.

(Gov X 1)  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 7, 2007. (Gov X 2)  \nShe answered the SOR in writing on September 25, 2007.  She admitted 17 allegations \nand denied five allegations under Guideline F.  She elected to have the matter decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Gov X 3)  Department counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on October 25, 2007.  Applicant received a complete file of \nrelevant material (FORM) on November 5, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to \nJanuary 23, 2008\n\n2 \n \nfile objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions.  She responded on November 20, 2007, providing additional information on \nher finances.  On December 20, 2007, Department Counsel noted that there was no \nobjection to consideration of the addition information provided by Applicant.  The case \nwas assigned to me on January 15, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c to1. h, 1.j to 1.o, 1.r to1.t, and 1.v.  She denied allegation 1.b, 1.i, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.u., \nShe also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a public \ntrust position.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old customer service representative for a defense \ncontractor.  She is a single mother with four children.  She does not receive child \nsupport for the children.  (Gov X 4; Gov X 5) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (Gov X 3), her answers to interrogatories (Gov X \n11), and credit reports (Gov Xs 6-10) establish that Applicant has delinquent debts, \ntotaling approximately $13,258.  The documents support a debt placed for collection in \nSeptember 2001 for a check cashing service for $536 (1.a); a medical debt placed in \ncollection in October 2001 for $188 (1.c); a credit card debt charged off in December \n2001 for $1,649 (1.d); a credit card debt charged off as a bad debt and placed for \ncollection in June 2002 for $1,036 (1.e); a credit card debt charged off as a bad debt in \nApril 2002 for $1,300 (1.f); a credit  card debt placed in collection in April 2002 for \n$2,919 (1.g); a credit account placed for collection in December 2002 for $312 (1.j); a \ntelephone account placed for collection in April 2003 for $663 (1.k); three unpaid traffic \ntickets placed for collection in April and July 2003 each for $120 (1.l, 1.n, 1.o); a \ndepartment store account placed for collection in July 2003 for $348 (1.m); a credit \naccount placed for collection in June 2006 for $278 (1.r); a credit account placed for \ncollection in November 2006 for $642 (1.s); a credit account placed for collection in \nNovember 2006 for $192 (1.t); and a medical account placed for collection in April 2007 \nfor $443 (1.v).   \n \n \nApplicant denies that she owes a delinquent medical debt placed for collection in \nOctober 2001 for $188 (1.b).  She states that she has disputed the debt.  She did not \npresent any information on the dispute.  Applicant denies she owes a debt placed for \ncollection in May 2002 for $935 (1.i).  She presented no information to support her \ndenial.  She denies a delinquent debt for a fourth traffic ticket in July 2003 for another \n$120 (1.p).  She presented no information to support her denial.  She denies a medical \naccount placed in collection in May 2005 for $52 (1.q).  She presented no information to \nsupport her denial.  She denies a delinquent account placed for collection in March \n2007 for $326. (1.u)  Applicant claims this is a duplicate account but presented no \ninformation to establish the duplication.  There is another delinquent debt to the same \ncreditor (1.a), but the account numbers and the amount of the debts are different. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant noted she has not contacted a credit counseling service. (Gov X 5 at 2)  \nShe also noted and presented her payroll records to show that her wages were \ngarnished.  However, she did not establish the account or accounts that the \ngarnishment was applied. (Gov X 5, at 4-7)  \n \n \nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant states she has an appointment with an \nattorney to discuss bankruptcy.  She presents no information concerning the \ndiscussions or documents prepared for a bankruptcy.  She noted she will have funds to \npay the attorney when she receives a tax refund in February 2008.   \n \n \nApplicant presented a letter in response to the FORM from a fellow employee \nthat she is dedicated to her job and her family, and is honest and trustworthy.  She can \nbe counted on to be a good team player and proactive in finding solutions to problems.  \nApplicant presented a letter from another co-worker and friend, in response to both the \nSOR and the FORM.  It was noted that she is organized, efficient, extremely competent, \nand has good rapport with customers.  She has demonstrated she is honest and \ntrustworthy with high personal and professional integrity.  Applicant also presented in \nher response to the FORM, a letter of commendation from her employer attesting to her \ngood work performance.  She presented her latest performance evaluation showing \ngood duty performance. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a security concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds.  (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an appellant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An appellant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligation.  Appellant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit cards, medical debts, and credit \naccounts, as established by credit reports and Appellant\u2019s admissions, are a security \nconcern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) \n\n5 \n \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations).  Appellant has delinquent debts from as early as 2001 that she \nhas not addressed or resolved.  Her debts allegedly accumulated because she is a \nsingle mother raising four children without child support. \n \n \nI have considered a number of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \n(FC MC).  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  \nWhile the debts may have been incurred from 2001 to 2007, they are still unpaid and \nthus current.  There are a number of different accounts and debts, so the debts were \nnot incurred infrequently.  Although she is a single mother, she has not established that \ndelinquent debts would not recur.  The continued debts and financial situation cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  While Applicant stated she is a \nsingle mother raising four children without child support, she has not presented any \ninformation to establish how this circumstance prevented her from paying debts.  She \nstated that she has not received financial counseling so FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person has \nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.  She has not \npresented any information to show she is making arrangements to pay her creditors, so \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Appellant has not presented \nsufficient information to mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant has not taken any action \n\n6 \n \nto resolve her financial issues.  Her promise to pay her debts in the future is not \nsufficient to mitigate security concerns.  She has not presented a consistent record of \nactions to resolve financial issues.  While she is a single mother with four children, she \nhas not established that she has taken timely and reasonable steps under the \ncircumstances to address her financial problems over the years.  The record shows that \nshe has been irresponsible towards her financial obligations indicating she may be \nunconcerned, irresponsible, or careless concerning sensitive information.  Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n                   \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for a Public Trust Position (PTA), on May\n22, 2006. On July 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F) and personal conduct (Guideline E). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 15, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October\n13, 2007, and the hearing was held on November 13, 2007. The government's three\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nexhibits (GE 1-3) were received in the record. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nsubmitted 17 exhibits (GE A through GE O) in the record. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr.) on November 29, 2007. Applicant submitted additional documents\nthat have been admitted in the record as AE P and AE Q. The post-hearing exhibits\ncontain information from the debt settlement firm, a printout of the trip cost for travel to\nobtain treatment for Applicant\u2019s children, and literature addressing bankruptcy. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nsensitive information is granted.\nRulings on Procedure\nAt the beginning of the hearing, I instructed Applicant that her husband could sit\nat the trial table to guide her through the proceedings, and offer advice when needed; I\nalso told her that if he intended to provide guidance at the trial table, he could not testify.\n(Tr. 5) As the hearing progressed, it became clear Applicant could not answer relevant\nquestions regarding the listed debts. I concluded her husband\u2019s testimony was essential\nin ascertaining the status of the four SOR debts. Hence, to promote the development of\na full record, and specifically to receive testimonial explanations from him about\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits and his efforts to resolve the debts, I reversed my original ruling and\nallowed Applicant\u2019s husband to testify. \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated August 15, 2007, Applicant essentially admitted\nthe factual allegations but disputed the charge-off dates. She also noted that certain\ndebts had been settled while other debts were being negotiated for settlement. She\ndenied the factual allegation in paragraph 2 that she deliberately omitted information\nfrom the PTA. She claimed she knew that the debts were delinquent but did not know\nthe debts were over 180 days delinquent.\nApplicant is 40 years old and a licensed clinical social worker. She has been\nmarried for 16 years and has three children. She seeks eligibility for access to sensitive\nposition. \nFinancial Considerations\nIn 1999, Applicant recalled she and her husband were handling their finances in\na responsible manner. On October 4, 1999, Applicant gave birth to triplets after\nencountering undescribed problems during her pregnancy. After the children were born,\nApplicant had to stop working to take care of them. The children had a medical problem\nthat could only be treated in city X located on the other side of the state. The medical\nproblem required 16 trips to city X between 2000 and 2005 to correct the problem. (AE\nQ) Each trip involved traveling to City X treatment location and remaining there for\nvarious periods while the children were being treated. \nBetween 2001 and 2006, Applicant's husband, a financial planner/broker, saw\nhis salary continue to diminish by almost 50%, according to tax records. (AE L) Financial\nproblems soon followed in 2002 in deciding which bills to pay first. In early 2003,\n\n3\nApplicant took a part-time job as a consultant through her church. Before long, her\nclientele began to grow dramatically, and her church asked her to move elsewhere\nbecause they could no longer handle the traffic. In the summer of 2003, she purchased\na building with three colleagues, and opened a social work consulting practice. After\napproximately nine months, the three colleagues withdrew from the venture, and left her\nsaddled with the building mortgage and other continuing expenses to operate the\nbuilding. The mortgage and expenses weighed heavily on Applicant\u2019s earnings. Her\nhusband's financial planning business continued to suffer. (AE L) Their children were\ngrowing and so were the expenses to raise them. \nApplicant and her husband put the building up for sale in 2005. They sold the\nbuilding in the spring of 2007, with the closing on May 4, 2007. Though they wanted\nmuch more, they were able to sell it for $185,000.00. After paying the costs connected to\nthe sale, they cleared $60,000.00. They used some of the proceeds to eliminate the\narrearage on their mortgage, and some to reduce the credit line on their home. They\nhired a debt settlement firm (AE J) to contact and negotiate a settlement with the listed\ncreditors. On March 2007, Applicant's husband acquired a second job as a professor for\nan online university. (AE A) Applicant has curtailed her spending by not eating in fancy\nrestaurants and avoiding expensive when grocery shopping. Applicant\u2019s husband has\nincorporated a detailed family budget into the daily finances.\nThere are four past due (charged off) debts identified under paragraph 1. The\ntotal amount of the debt is $69,747.00. Though Applicant contends the charge-off dates\nare incorrect, she still owes most of the debt amounts quoted (AE F). \n\u008e 1.a. The credit card account ($29,363.00) was opened in 1998 and charged\noff in October 2004. There is no evidence the account has been acted upon, and the\nrecord does not indicate the account is satisfied partially or completely. \n\u008e 1.b. The credit card account ($11,768.00) was opened in November 2000, and\ncharged off in May 2005. The account was settled in December 2007. (AE P)\n\u008e 1.c. A credit card account ($16,543.00) was opened in 1993 and charged off in\nJuly 2005.\n\u008e 1.d. A second credit card account ($12,073.00) from the same creditor\nidentified in 1.c., was charged off in July 2005. According to AE I, the account was\nsettled in September 2007. AE 1 also shows that Applicant settled with an unlisted\ncreditor.\nParagraph 2 of the SOR alleges Applicant intentionally falsified her PTA on May\n22, 2006. Question 22b. of the PTA requires information about debts over 180 days\ndelinquents. Applicant answered \u201cNO.\u201d She indicated:\nIt wasn\u2019t intentional at all when they said that I was in debt more than a\n180 days behind on any debt. I was  - - I didn\u2019t know and especially\nbecause, you know, as of today the reason, sir, the reason my husband\ntakes care of the all the finances is because there are sometimes - -\n\n4\nwhen I know, that you may not care about it - - But sometimes I don\u2019t with\n- - you know, the triplets if one is sick, I don\u2019t sleep well, you know, my\ndaughter has an infection right now. I haven\u2019t slept well. I work full-time\nso that\u2019s the reason why he tires to take away from me all that, you know\nsupposedly burden. Even though I\u2019m supposed to know all that. But at\nthe time when I filled out the application I did not know it and it wasn\u2019t my\nintention to lie about it. I did not know we were six months behind. (Tr.\n28)\nThroughout the hearing, Applicant was asked questions about the delinquent\ndebts. She repeatedly deferred to her husband for in depth explanations of each debt\nand specific efforts to resolve the debt. She testified that her primary job was to raise the\nchildren. She articulated the same position in her answers to the government\u2019s\ninterrogatories on June 8, 2007. (GE 2) I find she did not intentionally omit the\ndelinquent information from her (PTA) on May 22, 2006.\nAE A shows Applicant\u2019s budget, Applicant\u2019s income, and her husband\u2019s income\nfrom his financial planning position and from his teaching position. Applicant\u2019s husband\nbelieves they can eliminate the overdue debt in six months with the anticipated\n$40,000.00 he expects to receive in commissions. \nA licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) met Applicant when she began working\nfor the company as a case manager in April 2006. The LCSW considers Applicant to be\na diligent worker who carries out her duties in professional manner. From their\nincreasing social interaction, the LCSW believes Applicant\u2019s husband is a dedicated\nfather and supportive husband. \nThe minister of the neighborhood church has known Applicant and her husband\nfor 10 years. According to the minister, the Appellant and her husband are excellent\nparents. The minister considers Applicant to be a very ethical person.\nApplicant\u2019s performance two performance appraisals for April to July 2006, and\nthen July 2006 to July 2007 highlight Applicant\u2019s enthusiasm and dedication for the\nclients. \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for .\n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive\nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See Regulation \u00b6\nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security)\nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will\napply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of\nPersonnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the\nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access\ndetermination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n\n5\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2c., the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of committing poor\njudgment to generate funds. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nDemonstrating poor judgment during the security investigation is indicative of\npoor judgment while also demonstrating that the individual cannot safeguard classified\ninformation.\n\n6\nAnalysis\nThe government has established a case under FC disqualifying condition (DC)\n19.a. \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and FC DC 19.c. \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Four delinquent debts totaling $69,747.00 were charged\noff between 2004 and 2005. \nThere are four mitigating conditions (MC) that may apply to assuage the security\nconcerns associated with Applicant\u2019s indebtedness. FC MC 20.a. \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d applies even though the behavior was fairly recent\nand the amount of remaining debt is sizable. The medical problems of the children and\nApplicant\u2019s lack of success with the consulting practice are circumstances unlikely to\nrecur. \nApplicant receives substantial consideration under FC MC 20.b. \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted int the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the\nindividual acted reasonably.\u201d First, Applicant had to suspend her employment so she\ncould take care of her children in late 1999 and 2000, and thereafter. Second, Applicant\nand her husband spent much time and money traveling to the other side of the state to\nobtain treatment for the children. Third, the tax records (AE L) show Applicant\u2019s husband\nsaw his earnings drop by about 50% between 2001 and 2006.  Having weighed the\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s behavior between 2005 (when Applicant put the building on sale)\nand May 2007 (when Applicant sold the building), I conclude she acted reasonably\nunder the circumstances. First, she obtained employment with her current employer in\nApril 2006. Second, there is no evidence of additional accounts becoming delinquent\nafter 2005. Third, the sale of the building in May 2007 freed funds to apply to the listed\nand unlisted debts. In sum, FC 20.b. weighs heavily in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nReference is usually made to FC MC 20.c. \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control\u201d to determine whether counseling is needed.\nBecause each case turns on its own circumstances, it is noted that in Applicant\u2019s\nmarriage, she is responsible for the children and her husband is responsible for the\nfinances. Her husband\u2019s efforts in settling the delinquent debts, and his active use of a\nbudget to control their spending indicates that they are on the path to regaining control\nof their financial obligations. Applicant receives some mitigation under FC MC 20.c. and\nFC MC 20.d. \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\u201d While the debts in 1.b. and 1.d. were resolved by settlement\nrather than a full pay off, Applicant settled the 1.b. account in April 2007, almost three\nmonths before issuance of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s husband believes he will extinguish the\nremaining delinquent debt in 1.a. and 1c. in 6 months with the help of $20,000.00 in new\nbusiness. Though such a prediction may be overly optimistic, his progress to this point in\nsettling with the listed and unlisted creditors, and in bringing the house equity/credit line\nto a current status gives me ample reason to conclude he will satisfy the remaining debt.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n7\nDisplaying dishonesty during a trustworthiness investigation is generally\ndisqualifying under the PC guideline unless the evidence fails to establish all elements of\nPC DC 16.a. \u201cdeliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts from a personnel\nsecurity questionnaire use to determine security clearance eligibility.\u201d There was an\nomission of relevant information from a trustworthiness application. An initial review of\nApplicant\u2019s testimony raises a reasonable inference that she should have known the\ndebts were delinquent. She admits she knew. Considering her statements in the exhibits\nand her testimony at the hearing, I conclude that she knew the debts were delinquent,\nbut did not know they were over 180 days delinquent. Therefore, the element of\n\u201cdeliberateness\u201d is absent from PC DC 16.a.. Without all elements present, the\ndisqualifying condition has not been established. Subparagraph 2.a. is found in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of her conduct\nand all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2a. Those factors are: \u201c(1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2c., the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light\nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Since 1999, Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial health over the years has been hampered by three events, (1) the medical\nproblem that her children shared following birth in October 1999, (2) her husband\u2019s\nreduced earnings between 2001 and 2006, and (3) the purchase of the building in 2003\nthat turned out to be terrible burden on Applicant\u2019s bill paying capabilities. She and her\nhusband exercised good judgment by continuing to pay the mortgage on the building\nrather than letting it slip into foreclosure. Even though they were not able to sell the\nbuilding for more than a year or until May 2007, they did not let any other debts become\ndelinquent during the period. The documentation demonstrates they are actively\nnegotiating with the remaining two creditors, and should be able to resolve both\naccounts in the near future. The favorable character statements lauding Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter, and the equally probative job evaluation information describing her joy in her\nposition warrants a favorable outcome for Applicant under the financial considerations\nand personal conduct guidelines.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\n                     \nPaul J.

Clearance is\ngranted.  \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as\n1\namended and modified (Directive).\n The SOR lists the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.k as owing in the amount of $726.00. Schedule F of the\n2\nbankruptcy filing lists this debt owing in the amount of $2,128.00. The amount alleged in the SOR is the amount included\nin the calculation of the total debt owing herein.\n2\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by the DOHA on August 23, 2007. He\nadmitted all SOR allegations, except those listed in subparagraphs 1.t, 1.v and 1.w, and requested\na hearing.\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on September 28, 2007, and\nreassigned to me on October 2, 2007, due to caseload considerations. A notice of hearing was issued\non October 11, 2007, scheduling the hearing for October 29, 2007. The hearing was rescheduled to\nOctober 30, 2007, at Applicant\u2019s request, following a conference call held with Applicant\u2019s attorney\nand Department Counsel (see: Appellate Exhibit I). The hearing was conducted as rescheduled. The\ngovernment submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE)\n1-8, and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted one\ndocumentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1, and admitted into the record\nwithout objection. The record was held open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents in\nsupport of his case. One additional document was timely received, marked as AE 2, and admitted\ninto the record without objection. The transcript was received on November 14, 2007.     \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nfact:\nApplicant is a 61-year-old man who has been employed as storekeeper/material receiver at\nan air reserve base by a defense contractor since May 1990. He has compiled an exemplary work\nrecord and displayed a high degree of integrity, responsibility and ambition. His supervisor attests\nto Applicant\u2019s loyalty and requests a favorable clearance decision be made on his behalf. Applicant\nserved on active duty in the Army from 1964-67 and again from 1973-90. He retired as a Staff\nSergeant, paygrade E-6. Between 1967 and 1973 Applicant worked in a factory and as a cab driver.\nApplicant was married in April 1983. He has four step-children from that marriage. He\nphysically separated from his wife sometime in 2002, and they obtained a legal separation in March\n2004. Applicant is required to pay his wife $1,050.00 per month as maintenance. He plans on\nobtaining a divorce in the near future.\nThe SOR lists 17 debts, totaling $34,066.00, that were all included in a Chapter 13\nBankruptcy Petition Applicant filed in September 2006.  Also alleged are three debts, totaling\n2\n$198.00, that were not listed in the bankruptcy which, according to the credit bureau reports received\n\n3\nin evidence, were not listed in those reports until after the bankruptcy petition was filed. A Chapter\n13 plan was confirmed on November 16, 2006, that requires Applicant to make monthly payments\nof $111.00. Applicant has remitted payments on the plan on a regular basis, missing only one\npayment since the plan was confirmed, and will complete the plan in approximately 40 months. He\nattributes the missed payment to the need to repair his automobile that month. Applicant\u2019s financial\nstatement and testimony indicate he is presently living well within his means and will have the\nresources to continue making the required plan payments.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are due to him entrusting all bill payment to his wife and her\nfailing to live up to that trust. Specifically, Applicant asserted his wife assumed responsibility for\npaying all household bills, wrote all household checks, and was solely responsible for the household\nfinances. He had no reason to question her handling of those matters until approximately 2001 when\nhe first discovered notices for delinquent debts when he picked up mail from a post office box they\nrented. He confronted her about their debt situation and when it wasn\u2019t resolved he moved out of the\nfamily home sometime in 2002.\nApplicant attempted to make what payments he could on the delinquent debt until his wife\nobtained an individual discharge in bankruptcy and a court order requiring him to pay her\nmaintenance in the amount of $1,050.00 per month. His wife\u2019s creditors thereafter started contacting\nhim in an effort to collect on debts he previously considered to be her sole responsibility. Unable to\nmake the payments demanded of him by his and her creditors and the court-ordered maintenance\npayments, Applicant filed for the bankruptcy protection described above. \nApplicant previously sought bankruptcy protection in 1993 and 1994. The only record\nevidence about these filings are that Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 filing in July 1993 that\nwas reportedly discharged in November 1993, and filed a Chapter 13 filing in March 1994 that was\ndischarged in February 1997. Applicant testified his recollection is they filed both bankruptcies at\nabout the same time after his wife lost her job in an effort to retain a house they had purchased but\nwere unsuccessful in that effort.    \n \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline\nF, pertaining to financial considerations is most relevant in this case.   \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has\n3\nthe burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n4\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence,  although the government is required to present\n5\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n6\nless than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden\n7\nshifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the\ncase against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n8\nfavorable clearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n10\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d   Any reasonable\n11\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\nAs alleged in the SOR, and evidenced by Applicant\u2019s admissions, bankruptcy filing and\ncredit reports, Applicant had numerous accounts, totaling approximately $35,000.00, that became\ndelinquent. Most of those accounts remained delinquent until Applicant obtained Chapter 13\n\n5\nbankruptcy protection in November 2006. Three small accounts that were not listed in his credit\nreports at the time he filed for bankruptcy protection remain delinquent. Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19(b) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.\nApplicant credibly testified his recent financial distress originated due to his wife\nmismanaging the family finances. After he moved out of the marital residence and attempted to\nsatisfy creditors to the best of his ability, his wife obtained an individual discharge in bankruptcy and\na court order requiring him to pay a substantial portion of his pay to her as maintenance. Mitigating\nCondition 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na divorce, death, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\napplies.\nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection before he submitted a security clearance\napplication and obviously before the SOR was issued and he was formally notified his financial\nproblems might cause a security concern. He has made regular payments on the approved plan and\nappears to be living well within his financial means. He has the means to continue making the\nrequired payments, and based upon his appearance, demeanor and manner of testifying, I am satisfied\nhe will continue to make those payments and also resolve the three small debts that are still\noutstanding. Mitigating condition 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts applies.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions.\nApplicant served honorably in the Army for 20 years and retired therefrom. He has held steady\nemployment at the same location with defense contractors for the 17 years following his Army\nretirement. His supervisor vouches for his loyalty, integrity, responsibility and ambition and\nrecommends he be granted a security clearance. Other than his current financial problems, the only\nnegative record information about Applicant is the 1993 and 1994 bankruptcy filing(s) which\nApplicant credibly testified were caused by his wife\u2019s unexpected unemployment. While the record\nis unclear, Applicant\u2019s testimony and the timing of the filings strongly indicates there was an attempt\nto save Applicant\u2019s house from foreclosure by converting the Chapter 7 bankruptcy into a Chapter\n13 bankruptcy and this is effectively a single financial occurrence.   \nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Having done\nso, and having observed Applicant\u2019s appearance and demeanor while testifying, I conclude\nApplicant has presented sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome\nthe case against him. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraphs a-w:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 17, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on August 1, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on August 3, 2007. Department\nCounsel issued a ready to proceed notice on October 18, 2007. The hearing office\nJanuary 17,2008\n\nTr. at 10-12.\n1\nId. at 13.\n2\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated August 1, 2007.\n3\n2\nassigned this case to another administrative judge on October 26, 2007, and issued a\nnotice of hearing on November 5, 2007. The hearing office reassigned this case to me\non November 21, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 11,\n2007. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received and\nadmitted without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. At the hearing, Applicant\nsubmitted Exhibits (App Ex) A and B, which were marked and admitted over the\ngovernment\u2019s objection. The record closed at the end of the hearing. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2008. Based on a review of the case\nfile, pleadings and exhibits, Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline B. His eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Yemen, Russia, and Qatar.  The request and the attached\n1\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing\nExhibits I-III. Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that the facts administratively noticed must be\nlimited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute.2\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nEvidentiary Rulings\nThe government objected to the admission of Applicant Exhibits A and B on the\nbasis of relevance, arguing that the type of a job an Applicant performs isn\u2019t relevant to\nthe security clearance adjudication. I overruled the government\u2019s objection and admitted\nthe evidence, on the grounds I would determine what weight, if any, I would accord this\nevidence.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated August 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e -1.r of the SOR, with explanation. He denied the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d of the SOR.3\nApplicant, who is 30 years old, works as a member of a digital outreach team for\nthe Department of State.

Applicant became a U.S. citizen on July 7, 1994. He currently holds a U.S. passport.\nHis Yemen passport expired in 1997, and he does not intend to renew it.5\nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Yemen and is now a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s father\nworked in the Merchant Marines for approximately 25 years, and is now retired.\nApplicant sees his father periodically. While working for the Merchant Marines, his\nfather divided his time between Yemen and the U.S. His father owns a house in Yemen,\nbut not in the U.S. Since his retirement, Applicant\u2019s father continues to split his time\nbetween Yemen and the U.S. Applicant communicates with his father more frequently\nwhen his father is in the U.S. Applicant moved to his current geographical location in the\nU.S. two years ago. His father has visited him once.6\nApplicant\u2019s father married his first wife, who is not Applicant\u2019s mother, in the\n1960s. His father has one daughter, now 39 years old, from this marriage. Applicant\u2019s\nstep-sister lives in and is a citizen of Yemen. Applicant had little contact with her as he\ngrew up and continues to have little contact with her. He visited with her in 2003, but\nhas not had any contact with her since this time.7\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father married in the mid-1970s. His parents divorced\nwhen he was between ages 1 and 2. His Yemeni grandmother raised him and his\nbrother, who is 32 years old, after his parents divorced. His grandmother died in 2000. 8\nApplicant\u2019s brother immigrated to the U.S. with him in 1993. His brother\ncontinues to live and work in the U.S. To the best of Applicant\u2019s knowledge, his brother\nis still a citizen of Yemen.  Applicant does not know if his brother has become a U.S.\ncitizen because they talk infrequently, but acknowledged his brother could have\nobtained U.S. citizenship without his knowledge.9\nApplicant\u2019s mother married a second time subsequent to his parents\u2019 divorce.\nShe gave birth to three daughters during this marriage.

Applicant has no contact with his mother\u2019s second husband.\nApplicant\u2019s mother married her third husband five years ago. She lives with her husband\nin Qatar and is a citizen of Qatar. Applicant met his step-father in 2003 for the first time.\nHe has not seen his stepfather since and has spoken to him by telephone sometimes\nwhen he has called his mother. His stepfather is a retired employee of a Qatar city\ngovernment. His stepfather worked in a government position similar to a Department of\nMotor Vehicle position in the U.S. His mother is a homemaker, and to his knowledge\nnever worked for any government.10\nApplicant has three stepsisters, age 27, 25, and 21, from his mother\u2019s second\nmarriage. The oldest stepsister is a U.S. citizen, living and working in the U.S. His 25-\nyear-old and 21-year-old stepsisters live in Qatar with his mother and stepfather. They\nare citizens of Yemen. They are students and do not work, but have worked part-time in\nthe past. He has had little contact with these sisters most of his life, with the exception\nof their visit to the U.S. in 2006.11\nApplicant\u2019s father married his third wife after Applicant\u2019s parents divorced.\nApplicant\u2019s stepmother resides in Yemen. He does know her country of citizenship.\nApplicant has six stepbrothers, ages 22, 21, 20, 12, 8, and 5, and a stepsister age 9,\nthrough this marriage. The four younger children were born after Applicant immigrated\nto the U.S. He met these four half siblings for the first time in 2003. He has not had any\nregular contact with his seven half siblings since immigrating to the U. S. His\nstepmother did not encourage a relationship between him and her children. He believes\nthat five of his step siblings are U.S. citizens because his father is a U.S. citizen, but has\nnot provided  evidence to support this belief.12\nIn late December 2003 and early January 2004, Applicant visited his family in\nYemen and Qatar, remaining approximately 10 days in each country. During this trip, he\nstayed with his mother when in Qatar and with his father when in Yemen. He spent\nsome time with all the members of his family while visiting. He obtained a Yemen\nnational identify card for personal security while visiting Yemen. If challenged by anyone\nabout who he was, he could show this card, which provided more protection from harm\nthan any other identification he might possess.13\nIn March 2004, Applicant married a Russian immigrant, who is a resident alien.\nThey have one son, age 3, who was born in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen. Because it is\neasier for travel in Russia, he and his wife have decided to keep his son\u2019s Russian\ncitizenship in addition to his U.S. citizenship. His wife\u2019s parents and 16-year-old brother\nreside in and are citizens of Russia. His mother-in-law works as a teacher in Russia.

His brother-in-law is a student. His wife visited her\nfamily with their son in 2006. She stayed in Russia for three months. She now works as\nan office manager for a university. Applicant does not speak or understand Russian and\nhis in-laws do not speak or understand English. He does not talk with his in-laws beyond\nhello and does not know how often his wife speaks with her parents.14\nIn the summer of 2006, physicians diagnosed Applicant with cancer. He\nunderwent chemotherapy treatments in 2006. He told his mother about his medical\ndiagnosis. She traveled to the U.S. with her two younger daughters. They lived with\nApplicant for three to four months, then returned home to Yemen. Since their return\nhome, Applicant\u2019s contact with them has been limited.15\nApplicant owns no property overseas, nor does he anticipate inheriting any\nproperty from either of his parents. He does not have any overseas bank accounts.\nNone of his family members have been or are involved in politics. He has one Yemeni\nfriend, who lives and works in the U.S. If his parents were threatened, he would tell the\nU.S. government (\u201cmy government\u201d). He is not a member of any Yemeni cultural\ngroups. His finances are good and he has no criminal record.16\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. He praised Applicant\u2019s work skills\nand ethics. He described Applicant as a reliable professional, who would comply with\nthe requirements of a security clearance. He does not know anything about Applicant\u2019s\nfamily in Yemen and Qatar and very little about his wife, as Applicant seldom discusses\nher at work.  He recommends that Applicant be given a clearance. Applicant and his\nsupervisor have been interviewed by the news media about the program in which they\nwork. Applicant does not believe any members of his family saw the interview.17\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Yemen is a Republic and a\ndeveloping country. Its government, based on a constitution, is comprised of executive\nlegislative and judicial branches. Yemen\u2019s human rights record as it relates to detainees\nand prisoners is poor. Although the constitution provides for freedom of speech, religion,\nassembly and other freedoms, the government can and does ignore these constitutional\nrights frequently, in the interests of national security. The Yemeni government is making\na concerted effort to arrest and punish, through its judicial system, members of al-\nQaida, but is limited by the resources available for this effort. Recently, the Department\nof State issued a warning about the dangers of traveling in Yemen because of the\nrecent resurgence of al-Qaida. Over the last 50 years, the relationship between Yemen\nand the U.S. has fluctuated. Currently, Yemen is an important partner in the global war\non terrorism, and the defense relationship between the two nations is rapidly improving.\n\n6\nQatar is a constitutional monarchy and independent state. It is a rapidly\ndeveloping country in the Persian Gulf with strong and expanding relations with the U.S.\nQatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil, and has signed defense pacts with the U.S., U.K., and France. Its official\nreligion is Islam. Islamic law provides the foundation of the country\u2019s legal system.\nGenerally, the Qatar government respects the rights of its citizens and visitors. Incidents\nof violence are rare, but a concern remains about the possibility of terrorist attacks.\nRussia is a federation composed of 21 republics. It president is elected. Russians\ndo not have the same freedoms of speech and association known in the U.S. Russia is\ncurrently evolving from a centrally controlled economy to a free market economy.\nRussia has significant problems with human rights.  For those traveling to and within\nRussia, problems can develop with leaving Russia, particularly if there are problems\nwith the exit visa or a Russian passport. Relationships between the U.S. and Russia\ncan be best described as tense, particularly on the issues of Iran, Iranian nuclear power,\nand arms sales to certain countries, Russia is an active collective of intelligence,\nincluding industrial technologies and intelligence, both surreptitiously and openly,\nthrough several methods, particularly the internet.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n7\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: Foreign\ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or\nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable\nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes two conditions that are relevant to this case, could raise a\nsecurity concern, and may be disqualifying:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information;\n\nThe remaining disqualifying conditions are not applicable in this case.\n18\n8\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nHis mother, stepfather, and two stepsisters are residents of Qatar. His mother\nand stepfather are also citizens of Qatar and his two stepsisters are citizens of Yemen.\nUntil 2006, he had very limited contacts with his mother and his two stepsisters. When\nhe became ill, he told his mother, who immediately came to the U.S. His mother and\ntwo stepsisters lived with him for three or four months. His immediate proximity to these\nfamily members for a substantial period of time raises security concerns under\ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(a).\nHis stepmother and seven step siblings from his father\u2019s third marriage reside in\nYemen. His stepmother and at least two of these children are citizens of Yemen. His\nremaining siblings may be citizens of the U.S. and are citizens of Yemen. Since leaving\nYemen in 1993, Applicant contacted these family members periodically by telephone\nand e-mail. Although his father is a U.S. citizen, he lives with his Yemeni family part of\nthe time, raising the possibility of placing Applicant in a position of choosing between his\nfather and the U.S. Security concerns may be raised under disqualifying condition AG \u00b6\n7(a) as to these family members.18\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Russia residing and working in the U.S. His father-\nin-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens of and reside in Russia. His\ncontact with his in-laws is limited to hello on the telephone as he does not speak\nRussian and they do not speak English. His in-laws have never visited his wife and the\nfamily in the U.S. On the other hand, his wife and son spent three months visiting her\nfamily in Russia in 2006. His son is developing close contacts with his Russian\ngrandparents. His wife and son\u2019s close contacts with her family raises security concerns\nunder the disqualifying conditions identified in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 (b) and (d).\nHis brother resides in the U.S., and has for 14 years. His mother\u2019s oldest\ndaughter is a U.S. citizen, living in the U.S. Because these family members reside in the\nU.S., a security concern is not raised.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this\ncase:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n\nThe remaining mitigating conditions do not apply in this case.\n19\n9\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.19\nApplicant left Yemen over 14 years ago. Since his departure, his stepmother\ngave birth to four more children, whom he met for the first time when he visited Yemen\nfour years ago. Since his visit, his contacts with these family members have been\nsparse and infrequent, in part because he never developed any strong family ties with\nthem, as his stepmother did not encourage a relationship between he and her children.\nHe has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns regarding these family members under AG\n\u00b6 8 (c) because there is little likelihood that these contacts could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant obtained his U.S.\ncitizenship one year after immigrating to the U.S. He travels on his U.S. passport. He\ncompleted high school and his college degree after arriving in the U.S. He met and\nmarried his wife in the U.S. and his son is a U.S. citizen. He follows the laws of the U.S.\nHe has assimilated into the U.S. culture and is a responsible individual.\n \nWhen he was diagnosed with cancer, he told his mother, a very natural act for a\nson to do. His mother came to the U.S. to provide emotional support to him during his\n\n10\nchemotherapy treatments. By providing this information to his mother, Applicant\ndemonstrated that he is emotionally close to his mother. Her act of traveling to the U.S.\nto provide support to him shows the strength of their bound, even though his mother did\nnot raise him. With his two stepsisters living in his house for several months, he had\ntime to develop a relationship with them that had not previously existed. Although he\ndoes not see his father or brother frequently, he is still emotionally bound to them. His\nson and wife live with him. His wife has strong ties with her parents, who live in Russia,\nas shown by her lengthy visit in 2006. Their decision to keep their son\u2019s Russian\ncitizenship reflects the strength of her ties to her family and the heightened risk to him\nshould she return to Russia for a visit or to live. For all these reasons, I conclude that\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f\u2013o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p-q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRay T. Blank, Jr. Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has a history of illegal drug\nuse as recent as December 2004. He used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He failed\nto mitigate the security concerns raised under the drug involvement guideline. Applicant\nintentionally falsified his security clearance application. He has not mitigated the security concern\nunder the personal conduct guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe Government submitted seven items in support of its contentions.\n2\n Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated September 7, 2007).\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated June 23, 2005).\n4\nId.\n5\nId.\n6\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 23, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security\nClearance Application (SF 86). On July 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR,\n1\nwhich is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug\nInvolvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn September 7, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on September 21, 2007.   Applicant received a complete file of relevant\n2\nmaterial (FORM) on September 25, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and\nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Applicant did not submit\nany additional information. The case was assigned to me on December 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted to the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e, 2.b, and 2.c of the\nSOR  under Guideline H and Guideline E.  The admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.\n3\nApplicant denied allegations 1.f, 2.a, and 2.d of the SOR in part because he disagreed with some\nfacts. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  After graduating from high\n4\nschool in 1997, he attended a technical career center until 1999. From 1999 until 2003, Applicant\nserved in the military , receiving an honorable discharge. He has worked for his current employer\nsince December 2003. Applicant is divorced with no children.  He completed his security clearance\n5\napplication (SF 86) on June 23, 2005.6\n\nItem 2 supra at note 3.\n7\nItem 6 (Clearance Adjudication Records, dated August 2004 and 2005).\n8\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application, dated June 22, 2005).\n9\n3\nWhile in high school (1997), Applicant started using marijuana, experimenting with the\nillegal drug in social settings. He acknowledged that he continued using marijuana until sometime\nin 2003. \nIn 1998, Applicant was employed at a body shop. He decided to play a practical joke on a\nfellow employee who was asleep during a break. Applicant poured laquer thinner under the sleeping\nco-worker and lit it on fire. The co-worker awoke suddenly but he was not injured. Applicant\nreceived a warning from his employer.7\nIn 1999-2000, while in the military and holding a sensitive compartmented information\nclearance (SCI), Applicant used the illegal drug ecstacy several times. He obtained the drug from a\nfriend and used it alone in his family home. The drug was in a pill form. Applicant acknowledged\nthe drug made him hyper and talkative. He used the drug again for a period of time in 2003-2004.8\nIn April 2003, Applicant used percocet, a prescription drug, not prescribed to him. He\nreceived the pill from a friend. Applicant used it after drinking alcohol to enhance the effect of the\nalcohol. When Applicant completed his November 13, 2003 security clearance application, he did\nnot list his 2003 use of marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and percocet in answer to Question 27. He was\nswitching jobs and needed a security clearance. He did not want to lose his opportunity to get a\nsecurity clearance. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 28 concerning illegal drug use while having\na security clearance because he knew that admitting the use would not allow him to switch jobs and\nretain a security clearance.\nIn 2004, Applicant used cocaine on two separate occasions. Also, he was involved in the\ntransport of the cocaine in October 2004. The cocaine was in a small baggy that someone gave him\nto deliver to someone else. He denies that any money exchanged hands.9\nIn 2004, Applicant decided to train for health reasons at a gym on a regular basis. He went\nto the gym and claimed he did not have time anymore for drugs. He also met a new girlfriend who\ndid not like drugs and he decided he would not use drugs in the future. He regrets using drugs and\nbelieves it was a stupid thing to do. \nOn the June 23, 2005 security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question\n28 concerning use of illegal drugs while holding a sensitive position. However, he listed using\necstacy one time in 2004. He did not  disclose the use of cocaine, marijuana or percocet. Applicant\nheld a security clearance in the military from 2000 until 2003. Applicant was denied a security\nclearance in April 2005.\n\nItem 5 (Interrogatory, dated June 6, 2007).\n10\nId.\n11\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n12\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n13\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n14\n Id.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n16\n4\nApplicant has never been charged or arrested for using illegal drugs. He has not received any\ndrug treatment or rehabilitation. He claims he has no intention of using drugs in the future.  He\n10\nregrets using the drugs but believed he could hide the fact so he could maintain a clearance.  \n11\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n12\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n13\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n14\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n15\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.16\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n17\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 2002).\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n19\nAG \u00b6 24.\n20\n5\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n17\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n18\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  \n19\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guidelines H and E of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).\n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) The Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgement and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.20\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant used marijuana,\necstasy and cocaine for a period of more than seven years. Applicant admitted his most recent use in\n2004. Applicant used illegal drugs on multiple occasions while holding a security clearance.\nConsequently, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug use), DI DC\nAG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,\nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia), and DI DC AG \u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use\nafter being granted a clearance) apply.\nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. I considered Drug Involvement Consideration\nMitigating Condition (DI MC) AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). However,  Applicant used cocaine\nas recent as 2004. He used illegal drugs while serving in the military. Applicant held an SCI clearance\nduring the time he used illegal drugs. His use was not an isolated incident. This mitigating condition\ndoes not apply.\nApplicant provided insufficient evidence to support  DI MC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\nI find insufficient proof of a demonstrated intent. He has never sought counseling for drug use. He\n\nSee ISCR Case NO. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n21\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\n6\nconveniently voiced his desire not to use drugs in the future after the start of the current investigation.\nThe fact that he did not disclose all relevant information on his security clearance application in 2003\nand 2005 leaves me with doubt as to any demonstrated intent. Applicant claims his last use of cocaine\nwas in December 2004. Even if that is the case, given his long history of abuse, that is not a sufficient\nperiod of abstinence for mitigation. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOn November 13, 2003, and June 23, 2005, Applicant did not disclose all relevant information\nconcerning his drug use in response to Question 28. On November 13, 2003, Applicant, in response\nto Question 27, noted some of the drugs he used while in a sensitive position, but not all. He denied\nsuch use while in a sensitive position in his November 13, 2003 security clearance application. He\nadmitted that he was afraid that in switching jobs, if he disclosed the drug use, he would not get a\nsecurity clearance. He admitted that he did not want the Government to know of his illegal drug use\nbecause he had an SCI clearance at one time and was aware of the drug policy. I do not find his answer\nthat he  forgot to list all the drugs as reasonable, given his other statement in the record. Under DC PC\n16(a), (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire ......) the government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from  answers\nreferenced above in his 2003 and 2005 security clearance application. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence\nregarding an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.   I find that\n21\nApplicant deliberately falsified his answers on his 2003 and 2005 security clearance application.\nI have considered the mitigating conditions under personal conduct, and none of them apply.\nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use and his intentional falsification of answers concerning illegal\ndrug use do not persuade me that he just forgot to provide complete information on his security\nclearance application. \nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\n\n7\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant\u2019s long term and still quite recent lapse in judgment with drugs\nleaves doubt as to his reliability. I have considered his desire to put this behind him, but I conclude it\nis premature to find in favor of Applicant. Despite having an SCI clearance, Applicant continued to\nuse illegal drugs. He wanted to hide the issue from the Government so that he could maintain a\nsecurity clearance when switching jobs. He was honorably discharged from the military, but he has not\nmet the burden to overcome the security concerns. Applicant has demonstrated poor judgment,\ndishonesty, and lack of candor. This lack of reliability has spanned a period of many years. It is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.-2.d             \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Clearance is\ndenied.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 7, 2006, Applicant submitted a Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On July 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, \nmodified and revised. The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F \n(Financial), E (Personal Conduct), and J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons  \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nMarch 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a sworn statement signed on \nAugust 14, 2007, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. A letter was attached to the answer with some explanatory information. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated December 6, 2007, was \nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided a letter with \nadditional information dated February 22, 2008. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 8, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted in his response to the SOR six of the nine allegations of \nspecific delinquent debts in the SOR relating to financial issues He also admitted two \nallegations of a bankruptcy in 1997. He denied three delinquent debts for medical \nservices. He admitted two allegations relating to personal conduct concerning failure to \nregister for Selective Service and to disclose the delinquent debts in answer to Question \n38 of his SF 86. He also admitted the same allegation relating to failure to register with \nSelective Service in the allegation of criminal conduct. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n            Applicant is 33 years old who works for a defense contractor. He does not now \nhold a security clearance but seeks one to qualify for a position in the federal \ngovernment. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n            The security concern under Guideline F of the Directive is that Applicant \nincurred debts totaling over $17,000 which became delinquent and have not been \nresolved. In addition he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997 which was discharged in \n1998.  \n             \n            The letter enclosed with Applicant\u2019s answer stated some reasons why the three \nmedical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.f., and 1.g.) were incorrect. However, no evidence was \nprovided to substantiate his claim or dispute. All of the remaining delinquent debts are \nunresolved.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n    \n            Question 38 of Applicant\u2019s SF 86, asked if he had any debts that were 180 days \ndelinquent in the past seven years. Applicant answered, \u201cNo\u201d to this question \nnotwithstanding the fact that there were such debts. He does not deny that he knew of \nthe delinquent debts. \n \nAlso alleged under Guideline E is Applicant\u2019s failure to register under the \nSelective Service System as required by 50 U.S.C. Appendix 453. He admitted he failed \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nto register when he turned 18 years of age, but offered the explanation that he had a \nyoung family and was unfamiliar with U.S. laws. However, the record indicates that he \ndid not have a family at that time. He did attempt to register after he was 26 years old, \nbut registration is not permitted after that age.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nThe same facts relating to failure to register are alleged under Guideline J since \nsuch failure to register is a criminal offense punishable by a $10,000 fine and \nimprisonment for five years, if the prosecution is made within five years of a person \nattaining the age of 26. (Item 9).  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n            Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline F Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n           AG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n            Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit report (Items 5 \nand 7). At least six of the debts remain unresolved. The majority of his delinquent debts \nremain delinquent. He has provided insufficient documentation to show significant \nprogress resolving his debts. The government established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19 (c).  \n \n            Five Mitigating Conditions (MC) under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) have been considered. \nThey are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant provided a letter attached to his answer which indicates he has had \nsome discussions with a credit counseling service. However, this is insufficient to \nestablish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). His statement about contesting some of his \nmedical bills is insufficient to warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(e) to those debts because he \ndid not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  No other mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case. With respect to his failure to disclose information about his \ndelinquent debts on his SF 86, AG \u00b6 16(a) provides: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n \nSpecifically, his omission of delinquent debt information from his SF 86, \nconstitutes a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from his \nSF 86. Such conduct raises a security concern.  AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \nWith respect to his failure to register with the Selective Service and falsification of \nhis SF 86, the pertinent disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 16(d)(3), a pattern of rule \nviolations and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), which states, \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of \ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Certainly such conduct \nviolates important civil rules in our society, and is conduct a person might wish to \nconceal as it adversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(d)(3) and 16(e)(1) both apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven MCs that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his \nSF 86 on November 6, 2006, is sufficiently recent as to be disqualifying. He did not \npromptly inform the government of the falsification. He admitted the false statement at \nissue, and the falsification of his SF 86 is substantial and casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He failed to register with Selective \nService when he reached age 18 and did not attempt to do so for eight years when he \ncould have done so until reaching the maximum age to register.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d  Failure to register with the U.S. Selective Service System is a \nserious crime.  Applicant admitted he failed to register without good cause.   AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and 31(c) apply.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four MCs that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nInsufficient evidence has been offered to establish that any of the MC\u2019s are \napplicable in this matter. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions previously discussed through application of the whole person concept. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations, personal conduct and criminal \nconduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n         Paragraph 1, Guideline E:              \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.k.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n        Paragraph 2, Guideline E:                        AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:                        AGAINST APPLICANT \n            \nSubparagraph 2.a.:                        Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                                   \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on June 1, 2006. On August 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 28, 2007. Applicant\u2019s \nattorney submitted a notice of appearance on October 24, 2007. Applicant answered \nthe SOR in writing through counsel on October 27, 2007, which was received at DOHA \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \non November 2, 2007. Applicant elected to have his case decided at a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 26, 2007. The case was \nassigned to another judge at DOHA\u2019s Western Hearing Office on December 3, 2007. On \nJanuary 7, 2008, DOHA\u2019s Western Hearing Office issued a notice of hearing scheduling \nthe case for February 6, 2008.  \n \nOn January 16, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested the scheduled hearing be \ntransferred to the Washington Hearing Office because the Applicant had been \ntransferred to the East Coast on an \u201curgent basis.\u201d On January 18, 2008, DOHA\u2019s \nWestern Hearing Office cancelled the hearing scheduled for February 6, 2008. On \nJanuary 18, 2008, the case file was transferred to the Washington Hearing Office, and \nwas reassigned to me on January 23, 2008. On February 15, 2008, DOHA\u2019s \nWashington Hearing Office issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for March 18, \n2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through T, which \nwere admitted without objection, and he testified on his behalf. Tr. 8-10. Applicant also \noffered a letter (AE U) from a licensed Marriage, Family Therapist, who concluded after \nevaluating Applicant, \u201c[t]here was no basis to support that [Applicant] has an underlying \nalcohol dependence problem.\u201d Department Counsel objected to the admission of AE U \non the basis of foundation. After argument by counsel, I overruled Department \nCounsel\u2019s objection. Tr. 10-13. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 28, \n2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f., and \ndenied \u00b6 2.a. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old field service representative, who has been employed \nby a defense contractor since July 1997. Tr. 26-27.He has continuously held a security \nclearance since April 1994, which was initially granted to him while he was on active \nduty in the Navy, discussed infra. Tr. 18-19. There is no evidence to suggest, and the \nGovernment does not allege, that Applicant has ever compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. Nor does the record evidence show that Applicant \nhas ever failed to follow the rules and regulations required to protect classified \ninformation. He seeks to renew his clearance which is required as a condition of his \nemployment. GE 1, Tr. 19-20, 30-31.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1992. He served in the U.S. Navy \nfrom January 1994 to July 1997, and was honorably discharged as an Interior \nCommunications Electrician Third Class (pay grade E-4). He was a \u201cPlank Owner\u201d1 on \nan Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, and was awarded a Navy Achievement Medal \u201cfor \n \n1 Original crew member when ship was commissioned. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprofessional achievement in the superior performance of his duties as primary data \nmultiplexing system technician.\u201d AE N, Tr. 140. Applicant was awarded a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Information Technology in October 2007, and has also completed \nnumerous professional and work-related courses. AE I, AE J, AE P, Tr. 20-22. He was \nmarried to his first wife from April 1994 to August 1998. That marriage ended by \ndivorce. He has been married to his second wife since December 2000. He has two \nchildren, a seven-year-old daughter and a five-year-old son from his second marriage. \nGE 1. \n \nApplicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse, marked by his involvement in \nfour alcohol-related incidents. In December 1999, Applicant was arrested and found \nguilty of Operating Motor Vehicle Impaired by Alcohol. When stopped by the police, he \nrefused to take a field sobriety test because \u201cI don\u2019t believe those tests are designed for \nanyone to pass.\u201d Tr. 42. He was fined $300. He testified that he believed at the time he \nwas pleading guilty to \u201csome sort of traffic infraction.\u201d Tr. 44. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) He stated he \nhad been drinking before he was arrested but did not think he was drunk. Tr. 42. He \ntestified that he failed to list this arrest on his e-QIP because it did not come to mind \nwhen compared to his other alcohol-related arrests, discussed infra, which involved jail \ntime, community service or probation. Tr. 40-48, 89-91. \n \nIn August 1998, Applicant was arrested and found guilty of Operating a Motor \nVehicle under the Influence. He was fined $750 and ordered to attend a seven-day work \nprogram. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) At the time he was stopped, he was given a field sobriety test, \nwhich he passed. Referring to his previous testimony, he stated, \u201c[s]o that\u2019s why I say \nyou always fail these things.\u201d Tr. 50. Additionally, he was ordered to attend a seven-\nweek alcohol rehabilitation treatment program in November 1999. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) A \nLicensed Alcohol and Drug Counselor (LADC) from his treatment program stated in a \nletter dated December 16, 1999: \n \n[Applicant] participated in the Intensive Outpatient program in November \n1999, with 12 hours of treatment. [Applicant] then received 7 individual \nsessions and two consultations with the staff psychiatrist which \nsuccessfully addressed his depression. A consult with [LADC] this month \ndocumented his continued abstinence since completing I.O.P. We see no \nneed for further treatment sessions. [Applicant] has met the criteria for \ncompletion of treatment. GE 3. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he continued to drink after completing this program \nexplaining  (SOR \u00b6 1.f.): \n \nI don\u2019t have a legitimate excuse other than that period of my life was just \nnot a good one. I mean, it had to do with age. It had to do with my general \nstate of mind. My life was unhappy, and I didn\u2019t have the focus and clarity \nthat I have today. I was sort of lost. Tr. 50-51, 85-91. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHe further explained that he had gotten out of the Navy to save his marriage and \nended up getting divorced when his wife left him for another sailor. His parents were \ngoing through a \u201cmessy divorce\u201d and \u201cboth ended up in the psych ward for being \nabusive to one another. It just, it was a dismal time.\u201d Tr.48- 51-52. \n \nIn July 1997, Applicant was arrested and found guilty of Operating a Motor \nVehicle under the Influence. He was fined $250 and ordered to attend a two-day work \nprogram. (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) He had fallen asleep after drinking and smashed his truck into a \ntree. \n \nIn August 1996, while in the Navy, Applicant was arrested and found guilty of \nDriving under the Influence. He was fined $250 and placed on six months probation. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e.) He was arrested while driving his motorcycle drunk with a friend on the \nback. He stated, \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything stupider.\u201d Tr. 55. He was awarded non-judicial \npunishment for being on unauthorized absence during this alcohol-related arrest, and \nwas screened by a Navy Drug and Alcohol Program Advisor. The Advisor did not \nrecommend him for further alcohol-related treatment. Tr. 56, 81-82. \n \nApplicant has not had an alcohol-related incident for eight years. He described \nthe changes that occurred in his life since his last arrest. Those changes include the \nvalue he felt in his work life, and the impact he was able to have on those he interacted \nwith. He also bought his first house in 2000, he remarried in 2000, and now has two \nchildren. He returned to college in 2003 and graduated in 2007. His current job is more \nprestigious and technically challenging. He feels a tremendous sense of responsibility \ntowards his family and the need to provide for them. He has no desire to experience \nbeing arrested again because of the potential impact it could have on his career and \nfamily. He avoids associating with the individuals he drank with in the past and is family-\ncentric in his discretionary free time. He described his life as \u201cmuch fuller and brighter.\u201d \nTr. 56-60. \n \nHe stated he is not drinking, and the last drink he had was in December 2007 \nduring the holidays when a co-worker and friend came over for dinner. He felt guilty for \ndrinking and when his friend left, he poured his remaining beer down the drain. Tr. 60-\n61. He has not gotten behind the wheel of an automobile after drinking since his last \narrest in 1999. He has a strict no drinking and driving policy. Tr. 61. When Applicant and \nhis co-workers have socialized after work, he has refrained from drinking and served as \nthe designated driver. AE D, Tr. 63. As a result of the current proceedings, Applicant \nhas seen a counselor through his company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program, discussed \ninfra. Applicant plans to continue seeing this counselor to assist him in stress \nmanagement. Tr. 71-73. Applicant fully appreciates the seriousness of the current \nproceedings and the Government\u2019s concerns. Tr. 76-77. \n \nApplicant was evaluated by a Licensed Marriage, Family Therapist, who has \nbeen in practice since 1983. In a letter dated March 14, 2008, she concluded, \u201cI do not \nfind him to be chemically dependent.\u201d AE U. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP, and executed it on June 1, 2006, he failed \nto disclose his December 1999 arrest, as required. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) As Applicant explained, \nhe did not consider this arrest as significant as his other three alcohol-related arrests, \nwhich he did list on his e-QIP. GE 1. He testified: \n \nAt the time of filling out my security clearance application, I don\u2019t think that \nit (December 1999 arrest) came to mind. I mean it was much less \nsignificant and much less substantial than my other arrest[s], which did \ninvolve jail time, community service, probation. I just, I don\u2019t think that I \nthought of it \u2013 up until this year I\u2019ve always just viewed this as a ticket. I \ndidn\u2019t say, gosh, I\u2019ve had three drinking and driving arrests \u2013 which is \nthree too many; that\u2019s horrible. But up until this year I\u2019ve considered \nmyself as having been arrested three times. The fourth was just a ticket, \nand I didn\u2019t think of it at the time of filling out the form.  \n \nAdding, when asked whether he was trying to hide this arrest: \n \nNo. I wouldn\u2019t\u2019 dare try to hide it. I mean, in 2006 I know there\u2019s \ncomputers, I know there\u2019s databases. I listed the other three (arrests). I \nlisted the driving, the arrests that were beyond a seven-year scope of the \nform. I felt when I filled out the form that I did completely and honestly. I \ndid not intentionally leave it off. Tr. 45-46. \n \nApplicant submitted seven sworn declaration reference letters. Extracts of those \nletters follow. \u201c[Applicant] can not only be trusted to hold a position that requires good \njudgment and a high degree of responsibility, he is already entrusted with such a \nposition. Only the most responsible, conscientious individuals are allowed to travel and \nrepresent the good name of [defense contractor].\u201d AE A. Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor, \nstated, \u201cI would entrust [Applicant] with a position that requires good judgment and a high \ndegree of responsibility.\u201d AE B. \u201cIn all of the [name] software testing on the [name] \nproject he performed for me, [Applicant] was very thorough and ensured that the final \nproduct was ready and reliable for the naval operator.\u201d AE C.  \n \n\u201c[Applicant] is an excellent employee and does outstanding work. He is well-\nrespected and well-liked by his team members, and he demonstrates an extraordinary \nattention to detail.\u201d AE D. \u201c[Applicant] is an exceptional employee who does excellent \nwork. He is the person I consistently go to in order to get a job done. For example, when \nI was traveling to [employment site] for the specific purpose of accomplishing certain \ntesting within a short period of time, [Applicant] is who I wanted to work with because I \nknew that he was dependable and would deliver and get the job done quickly and \ncorrectly.\u201d AE E.  \n \n\u201cI would, and the company does, entrust [Applicant] with a position that requires \ngood judgment and a high degree of personal responsibility. [Applicant] is invaluable in \nthis role and it is imperative that he has security clearance because he must have the \nclearance in order to board the ships. AE F. \u201cIn terms of employment performance, \n\n \n6 \n \n \n[Applicant\u2019s] work is excellent. I have never had any issues at all with the quality of work \nhe has done on a project.\u201d AE G.  \n \nAll seven individuals know Applicant well, hold clearances at the secret level or \nhigher, they all are familiar with the allegations in the SOR, and know Applicant in a \npersonal and professional capacity. None of these senior employees, who would be in a \nposition to know, have ever seen Applicant using alcohol at work, or intoxicated or \nimpaired. They all strongly recommend Applicant for a clearance. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work performance evaluations for the last four years reflect consistent \nabove average performance. AE O. He is also the recipient of 14 separate company \nawards. AE M. He was in part responsible for the a government agency submitting a \nContractor Performance Assessment Report to his defense contractor employer with \ngrades of \u201cVery Good\u201d to \u201cExceptional\u201d for work performed from March 2006 to March \n2007. AE O. He has completed numerous company-sponsored courses during his \nemployment. AE P. Applicant\u2019s February 2008 credit report reflects a 742 \u201cPLUS Score\u201d \nand a credit category of \u201cExcellent.\u201d AE R. He is registered to vote, and served on jury \nduty in 2006. AE S.  \n \nHaving observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor closely, I find his testimony credible. At \nhis hearing, Applicant promptly answered all the questions asked. He was frank, candid, \nand forthcoming in his answers and explained his answers without hesitation. He readily \nadmitted his bad behavior and apologized numerous times for his questionable \nbehavior. Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his actions.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), the Government\u2019s concern is that \nexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline G through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence presented. Applicant had four separate alcohol-related \narrests in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. He also attended a court-ordered alcohol \ntreatment program following his 1998 arrest.  \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two Alcohol Consumption \nDisqualifying Conditions. AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, \nsuch as driving while under the influence,\u201d applies because of his four alcohol-\nrelated arrests. AG \u00b6 22(e): \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence \nby a licensed clinical social worker who is staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program,\u201d applies because of his evaluation and treatment program in \nNovember 1999 following his August 1988 arrest.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find application of \nthree Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions is appropriate. AG \u00b6 23(a) \u201cso much \ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d applies. Applicant\u2019s most recent \nalcohol-related arrest was eight years ago. Furthermore, there are no documented \nalcohol-related incidents of any sort for the past eight years.  \nAG \u00b6 23(b) \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an \nalcohol abuser);\u201d in part applies. Although Applicant has never been diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser, he has acknowledged and recognizes the \ndeleterious effect the misuse alcohol has had on his life. Two qualified medical \nprofessionals have evaluated Applicant and neither indicated he was an alcohol abuser \nor alcohol dependent. The first evaluation occurred in December 1999 following his \n1998 alcohol-related arrest and the second evaluation occurred in March 2008 on \nApplicant\u2019s own volition in anticipation of this hearing. In particular, his March 2008 \nevaluation specifically stated there is no basis to support the notion Applicant has an \nunderlying alcohol dependence problem. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) \u201c(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous \nor a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a \nrecognized alcohol treatment program;\u201d applies.  \n \nApplicant presented credible evidence of actions taken to overcome his problem, \nand established he is currently abstinent and submitted evidence he is not alcohol \ndependent. He is remorseful for his behavior and has initiated changes in his lifestyle. \nHis performance appraisals, certificates of achievement, awards, and the statements \nfrom senior company representatives show Applicant\u2019s work behavior has not been \nindicative of his having an alcohol problem. He is viewed as a valuable employee, who \nis reliable, dependable, and professional. His sobriety and responsible use of alcohol is \nsupported by seven senior company officials, who know him personally and \nprofessionally, and by his own credible testimony and evidence presented. At his \nhearing, Applicant acknowledged the problems misuse of alcohol has caused him, \ndemonstrated remorse, and a steadfast commitment to continue lifestyle changes \nconsistent with responsible use of alcohol.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), the Government\u2019s concern is conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. AG \u00b6 15. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group.  \n \nPosing potential security concerns are Applicant\u2019s documented omissions of his \n1999 alcohol-related arrest from his e-QIP completed in June 2006. His omissions are \nattributable to his misunderstanding and oversight. I found Applicant\u2019s explanation \ncredible in light of his having listed alcohol-related arrests beyond the seven-year time \nperiod required, and his acknowledgment that he knew and understood his answers \nwere subject to verification. His submission of three other alcohol-related arrests put the \ngovernment on notice that alcohol consumption had been a concern in the past. I found \nApplicant to be credible and that he acted in good faith. While Applicant could \nreasonably have been expected to be more diligent and thorough when answering \nQuestion 23, his judgment lapses and confusion are not enough to impute knowing and \nwillful falsification under Guideline E.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of his omissions is persuasive enough to avert inferences \nof knowing and willful omission. There being no misconduct substantiated, there is no \nneed to discuss Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nApplicant has been willing to do whatever is necessary to maintain his sobriety, \nincluding maintaining voluntary contact with his counselor on a regular basis. He has \nfamily support, stable employment and a strong work ethic. His participation in his \nEmployee Assistance Program, and his company support should ensure his continued \nsuccess. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to being sober. \nConsidering his demeanor and testimony, I believe Applicant has learned from his \nmistakes, and his questionable behavior is unlikely to recur. In sum, I find Applicant has \npresented sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  \n \nAlso noteworthy is Applicant\u2019s past behavior, which serves as a reliable indicator \nof future behavior. In particular, he has successfully held a security clearance for the \npast 14 years. He has not had an alcohol-related incident for eight years. He has been \ncooperative throughout this process and recognizes the gravity of these proceedings. \nApplicant is living a different lifestyle from the person who was arrested eight years ago \nfor Operating a Motor Vehicle while Intoxicated. He is married, the father of two young \nchildren, a home owner, a responsible and contributing citizen, and a very valued and \ntrusted employee.  \n \nI also considered the facts of the case and nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a) supra relating to Personal Conduct concerns. Falsifications are a \ncore security concern. Inasmuch as Applicant\u2019s behavior was not deliberate or willful, no \nmisconduct was established precluding the applicability of further discussion under the \nWhole Person Concept. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the law, as set forth \nin Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the \nwhole person factors\u201d2 and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \n \n2See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nGuidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 f.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 30, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene Lokey-Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had delinquent and outstanding debts to at least nine different\ncreditors totaling approximately $52,000.  Applicant had been unsuccessful in setting up a debt\nrepayment plan or obtaining a debt consolidation loan.  At the time of hearing, he had saved $3,600\nfor the purpose of debt payment and had paid one of the outstanding debts. Decision at 2-3.   The\nJudge also found that Applicant had deliberately falsified his security clearance application (SCA)\nwhen in response to the questions as to whether he had debts that had been delinquent more than 90\nand 180 days respectively, or any judgements against him, he answered \u201cno.\u201d Decision at 3-4.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.

On July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 17, 2007, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on December 3, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 17,\n2007, scheduling the hearing for January 10, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented eight exhibits.  The Applicant presented five exhibits and testified on his own\nbehalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on January 18, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 44 years old and has a high school\ndiploma and a year and a half of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nSecurity Guard and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  From October\n2004 through November 2005, the Applicant was unemployed.  During that year he\nreceived unemployment benefits but they were not enough to cover his bills.  He used\ncredit cards to subsidize his income and became deeper indebted.  He tried to make\npayments to the creditors but only fell farther and farther behind.  \nFrom time to time, between 1992 and 2004, for about a three to four years\nperiod, the Applicant also helped family members in need, including his sister and a\nbrother by giving them a place to live and food to eat when they could not provide for\nthemselves because of their drug addictions.  He also helped a friend who was suffering\nfrom the same condition.  He co-signed for a vehicle for his nephew who ultimately\ndefaulted on the car loan.  All of this took a serious toll on the Applicant\u2019s financial\nsituation. The Applicant lost his apartment because he could not afford to pay his rent.\nIt was also about this time that his wife left him.  The Applicant moved into a motel\nwhere he paid $50.00 a month.  He tried to find employment but was unsuccessful, so\nhe decided to go to school to improve himself.  He moved in with a friend and then with\nhis sister.        \nCredit reports of the Applicant indicate that he is indebted to at least nine\nseparate creditors that include credit cards and personal loans totaling an amount in\nexcess of $ 52,000.00.  (See Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6 and 7).   A debt to Citi\nFinancial in the amount of $4,332.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt to Citi\nin the amount of $7,459.00 remains delinquent and outstanding. A debt to Applied CD\nBank in the amount of $3,613.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt to\nGEMB/CCARC in the amount of $3,444.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt\n\n3\nto Midland in the amount of $633.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt to\nBeneficial/HFC in the amount of $2,878.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt\nto AMGNL in the amount of $1,974.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt to\nGMAC in the amount of $25,846.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt to\nAmerican General Finance in the amount of $2,001.00 has been paid.  A debt to First\nNational CC in the amount of $478.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.        \nIn November 2005, the Applicant was hired by his current employer.  In order to\nresolve his indebtedness, he tried to get set up a payment plan with his creditors but\nthey refused him and wanted full payment immediately.  He tried to obtain a debt\nconsolidation loan and discussed his situation with consumer credit counselors but they\nwanted some collateral for the loan and the Applicant had anything to offer them.     \nIn an effort to pay his delinquent debts the only way available to him was to\napproach each debt one by one until all of his delinquent debts are paid in full.  The\nApplicant saved the sum of $3,600.00 and paid off his debt to American General\nFinance Company.  He is presently saving money to pay off another one of his\ndelinquent debts.  The Applicant has also paid other delinquent debts that are not\nalleged in the SOR.  (See Government Exhibit 3).  He voluntarily returned to his landlord\nto pay him the money he owed him.  (Tr. p. 53).  \nThe Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement dated May 31, 2007, indicates that\nhe is financially incapable of paying the delinquent debts set forth in the SOR.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 3).  \n  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material\naspects of his personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions dated\nSeptember 14, 2005.  Question 27(d) asked him if in the last seven years has he had\nany judgments against him that have not been paid.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.\n(See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a  false response.  The Applicant failed to reveal\nthe judgment he had against him in the amount of $2,001.00 by American General\nFinance.  \nQuestion 28(a) of the same application asked the Applicant if he has ever been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debts.  Question 28(b) asked him if he was currently\n90 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u2018NO\u201d.  (See Government\nExhibit 1).  This was a false response.  The Applicant explained that when he completed\nthe application, he thought that it would prevent him from getting the job if he answered\nthe questions truthfully.  (Tr. p. 66).  \n\n4\nI find that the Applicant knew about his delinquent debts at the time he completed\nthe application and intentionally sought to conceal them from the Government.   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  OF special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n5\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\n\n6\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and he has been untruthful on\nhis Questionnaire for National Security Positions (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates\npoor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because\nof the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant is a compassionate, kind and caring individual, but his kindness\nhas contributed to his financial delinquencies.  Considering all of the evidence, the\nApplicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nthat is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With respect to his finances, the\nApplicant has in excess of $ 52,000.00 in delinquent debt.  He has recently paid off one\nof the debts and plans to continue to pay all of his debts, one by one as he saves the\nmoney to do so.  However, he has just started to address his delinquent debts and has\na long way to go before they are resolved.  At the present time, he has not presented\n\n7\nsufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or that he\nhas resolved his financial indebtedness.\n \nUpon review of his financial statement, it appears that he has no disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his past due bills.  There is little evidence of\nfinancial rehabilitation at this time.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nDisqualifying Conditions 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions\napply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant\nhas not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve his debts.   Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Applicant deliberately concealed material\ninformation from the Government on his security clearance application in response to\nhis financial matters.  With the particular evidence that I have been provided, there is no\nreasonable excuse for his failure to answer the questions truthfully.  Consequently, the\nevidence shows that the Applicant cannot be trusted with the national secrets.\nDisqualifying Condition 16(a)  the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately sought to conceal\nmaterial information from the Government and that he cannot be trusted with the\nnational secrets.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On September 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on October 6, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on January 9, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 31,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for February 19, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant\npresented no exhibits.  However, she did testify on her own behalf.  The record\nremained open until March 2, 2008, to allow the Applicant to submit additional\nsupporting documentation.  She did not submit any additional documentation.  The\nofficial transcript (Tr.) was received on February 28, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 48 years old.  She is  employed by a defense contractor as a\nMaintenance Custodian and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with\nher employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n          In 2002, the Applicant quit her job at a book binding factory because the glue that\nshe had to work with was having a negative effect on her hands.

During\nthis period, she lived with her son who took care of her.  She was not employed again\nuntil 2005, when she started working for her current employer.  \nThe Applicant admitted that she is indebted to a creditor for a judgment that was\nentered against her in the amount of $10,060.00.  This debt arose out of a situation in\nFebruary or March 1999, when she co-signed for a car for her daughter.  Her daughter\nmade the payments for a while, and then at some point decided that she did not want\nthe car and stopped making the monthly payments.  The car was voluntarily\nrepossessed.  (Tr. pp. 22-25).  The Applicant believes that she should not be held\nresponsible for the entire amount of the judgment because the car was sold at auction\nby the creditor for $4,000.00.  Her sister has been disputing the debt for her.  (Tr. p. 26)\nThe Applicant is also indebted to the following creditors for accounts that have\nbeen sent to collection: a creditor in the amount of $218.00, a creditor in the amount\n$45.00, a creditor in the amount of $273.00, a creditor in the amount of $185.00, a\ncreditor in the amount of $464.00, a creditor in the amount of $3,218.00 and a creditor\nin the amount of $465.00.  (See Government Exhibits 3, 4,5 and 6).  \nThe Applicant currently lives with her oldest daughter and pays about $250.00 a\nmonth toward rent and utilities.  She pays her car insurance of $61.00 a month and has\nno other monthly bills besides her cell phone, food and gas.  She earns $9.50 an hour\nand brings home approximately $875.00 per month.   At the end of the month she has\nbetween $300.00 and $350.00 that could be used to pay her delinquent debts.  (Tr. pp.\n50\u201355).  She plans to pay each of her delinquent debts, one at a time, until all of then\nare paid in full.  \n\n3\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.

The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\n\n5\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant is indebted to nine separate creditors in the total amount of\napproximately $11,800.00.  Since 2005, she has been working full time for her current\nemployer, however, with respect to her past due debts, she has done nothing to resolve\nthem.  At the present time, she remains indebted to each of her creditors and is\nresponsible for the judgment that was entered against her.  She has failed to\ndemonstrate a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has resolved her\nfinancial indebtedness.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not\nintroduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to\novercome the Government's case. \n \nUpon review of her financial statement, it appears that she has some disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay her delinquent debts.  However, she has not yet\nbegun the process.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation at this time.  Under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)  inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\napply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Her financial problems remain current,\nthey are not isolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to\nrepay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 18, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).1 On October 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \n \n1Item 4. There is an allegation of falsification of the 2006 SF 86.   \n \n2Item 1 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Oct. 28, 2007). Item 1 is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nMay 8, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (Answer), \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated February 6, 2008, was \nprovided to him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.4 On March 10, 2007, Applicant \nprovided a letter with five enclosures (Response to FORM). Applicant\u2019s submission was \nreceived at DOHA on March 17, 2008. The case was assigned to me on April 2, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. - 1.f., and 1.h. - 1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g., 2.a., and 2.b. His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old senior information technology analyst, who has been \nworking for his defense contractor employer since January 2006. He served in the U.S. \nAir Force inactive reserves as an enlisted member from September 1982 to July 1984, \nand was awarded a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions. He attended a \nuniversity for a brief period from June 2000 to July 2000. He was married to his wife in \nJune 2000 , separated from her in June 2003, and was granted a judgment of absolute \ndivorce in January 2007. Applicant has two adult sons, ages 23 and 19, from a previous \nrelationship.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded a review of his March 2006, May 2007, and October 2007 credit bureau \nreports.5. During an interview on December 12, 2006, a government background \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated February 6, 2008, \nwhich he received on February 13, 2008. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 \ndays after Applicant\u2019s receipt to submit information. \n \n5 Items 5 through 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ninvestigator confronted Applicant about his delinquencies. Consistent with his 2006 \nstatement, Applicant stated in his Response to FORM that his financial problems started \naround 2005 when he tore his Achilles tendon at a family reunion playing basketball. \nFollowing this injury, Applicant underwent surgery and a period of convalescence lasting \napproximately six weeks. While he was convalescing, his company downsized and \noutsourced his job overseas, which lead to a period of unemployment lasting several \nmonths.6 Not generating any income and without funds, Applicant fell behind on his \nmonthly bills until he was able to find work in January 2006. \n \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately \n$41,300. The alleged debts are supported by the government\u2019s evidence, which were \nconfirmed by Applicant in his Answer and Response to FORM. Debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.d. are collection accounts for uncovered medical bills. Applicant \nsubmitted documentation that he made payment arrangements for these debts and is \ncurrent on his payments.7 SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a collection account for back child/family \nsupport for $20,825. Applicant submitted documentation that he has contacted the \ncognizant agency and is making payments of $50 per month. Applicant further \nexplained that he had full custody of his two sons and was providing them with 100% of \ntheir support from 2000 to 2006. After Applicant assumed physical custody of the boys \nin 2000, the boys\u2019 mother did not pursue child support. Neither she nor Applicant \nnotified the authorities of this change in custody/support, which allowed the child \nsupport arrearage to accrue. In the interim, Applicant continues to pay $50 per month to \nthe agency until he pays off his arrearages or otherwise resolves this debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f. and 1.g. are charged off accounts. Applicant has contacted the \ncreditor in \u00b6 1.f. and made payment arrangements and is current on his payments. He \nhas paid off the debt alleged in \u00b6 1.g. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. 1.i., and 1.j. are state/county tax liens \ntotaling approximately $11,170. Applicant contacted the cognizant authorities and made \npayment arrangements and is current on his payments. These three tax liens have been \nconsolidated. \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant falsified his January 2006 security clearance \napplication. In response to question 27 asking whether a lien had ever been placed \nagainst his property in the last seven years for failing to pay taxes or other debts, the \nSOR alleged Applicant failed to list his tax liens identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. and 1.j. \nApplicant responded in his Answer that he did not intentionally omit listing these tax \nliens because he did not know the tax liens existed and added that he did not own any \nproperty. Department Counsel countered in the FORM that Applicant claims to be both \nunaware of his lien(s), and even if aware of the lien(s), he was not required to disclose \n \n6Item 11, Response to FORM. \n \n7In Applicant\u2019s Answer, he did not provide documentation of payment arrangement(s)/proof of \npayment(s) to debts alleged in SOR \u00b61.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f. As to those debts, Applicant provided \ncreditor phone numbers and points of contact. Department Counsel noted Applicant\u2019s lack of \ndocumentation. Applicant provided the missing documentation reflecting he has paid or is making \npayments on all debts alleged in his Response to FORM. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nthem because he owns no property. Department Counsel further argues that Applicant \nfailed to disclose his child support arrearage on his security clearance application and \nprovided a contradictory explanation regarding one of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nDepartment Counsel argues these omissions establish circumstantial evidence pointing \nto Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility. Applicant emphatically reiterated his denial that he \ndeliberately falsified his security clearance application in his Response to FORM. There \nis no record evidence that Applicant received notification of any tax lien(s). \n \nApplicant provided four work-related references from management and one \npersonal reference. His work-related references describe Applicant as a stellar \nperformer, loyal, trusted, and a valuable employee, whom they view as a valuable asset \nto their team. All references recommend Applicant for a clearance. His personal \nreference is a long-time personal friend of 21 years, who describes Applicant as \nreliable, dependable, and family oriented. His personal reference holds a security \nclearance and recommends Applicant for a clearance. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the \nDisqualifying and Mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to \nthe facts and circumstances of the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as \ninflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision \nmust also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in \nSection 6.3 of the Directive,8 and the whole person concept.9 Having considered the \nrecord evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) are the applicable \nrelevant adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n \n \n8Directive, Section 6.3. \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d \n \n9Directive \u00b6 2(a). \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables \nknown as the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person \nconcept includes the consideration of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and \nrecency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence. . .\u201d \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nBurden of Proof \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.10 The government has the initial burden of proving \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must \nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.11 The responsibility then shifts to \nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one \nhas a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of \npersuasion.12  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, \ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.13 \n \nConclusions \n \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),14 the government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to \n2005. At the time the SOR was issued, he had accumulated ten debts totaling \napproximately $41,300. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 \n19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \n \n10See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n11ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a \nscintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, \n2006) (Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n \n12Egan, supra n.6, at 528, 531. \n \n13See Id; Directive Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n14Guidelines \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nfinancial obligations; and FC DC \u00b6 19(g): failure to file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same; apply in this case. \n \nIn 2005, Applicant was injured and required surgery followed by a period of \nconvalescence. While convalescing, his job was outsourced and he found himself \nunemployed. With no income, he was unable to pay his bills. The financial toll of this \nsudden and lengthy income loss placed Applicant in a precarious financial situation from \nwhich he is still recovering. These facts demonstrate circumstances beyond his control.  \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation demonstrating that he paid one of his debts in \nfull, and contacted his remaining creditors establishing realistic payment plans. His \nevidence further reflects he has remained current on his payment plans. His evidence \nreflects he has the resolve and wherewithal to pay down his remaining debts. \nApplicant\u2019s monthly budget reflects a net remainder of $675.15 \n \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,16 I conclude that two of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) \nGuidelines \u00b6 20(b): The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and FC MC \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; apply in this \ncase.  \n \nApplicant presented evidence showing he dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations. He contacted all of his creditors and either paid off his debt(s) or \nestablished a payment plan for his remaining debt(s). His demonstrated efforts point to \nhis commitment to resolve this matter. Applicant is financially responsible and has taken \ncontrol of his financial situation. Based on the available evidence, his financial problems \nare not likely to be a concern in the future.   \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process. Guidelines & 15. \n \nThe government\u2019s evidence established that he failed to disclose relevant \ninformation in his answers to question 27 on his security clearance application. \nConsidering the record as a whole, I am convinced Applicant did not intentionally \n \n15Item 11. \n \n16See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a \nwhole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwithhold this information. Numerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that \nconclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education, his employment history, \nhis explanation, the number and value of the debts, his life circumstances at the time, \nhis personal and work-related references, and the plausibility of his explanation. While \nhe should have exercised greater diligence and care in completing his security \nclearance application, I do not find his failure to disclose his liens deliberate. \nAccordingly, no disqualifying conditions are applicable foregoing the necessity of \ndiscussing mitigating conditions. \n \n \nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I applied the \nwhole person concept. I specifically considered Applicant\u2019s age, education, his military \nservice, his family history, his valued service as a defense contractor employee, his \ndemonstrated resolve to pay down his debts, his maturity, work performance \nrecommendations, and commitment to his family. Considering the totality of Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances, he demonstrated sufficient judgment and trustworthiness in the handling \nof his financial affairs.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) (GE 1) on June 27, 2005. On September 28, 2007, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nFebruary 6, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 24, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December 6, 2007. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 14, 2007. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on January 7, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted exhibit (AE) 1 post-hearing, which was received without objection. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 25, 2008, to submit additional \nmatters. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 10, 2008. The \nrecord closed on January 25, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 24, 2007, Applicant denied all SOR \nallegations. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor \nand testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old network engineer. In September 1968, he enlisted in \nthe U.S. Coast Guard where he served as a Communication Specialist for 29 years. He \nretired from the Coast Guard in June 1997 at the rank of Chief Warrant Officer 3 (Tr. 5-\n7). His service in the Coast Guard was characterized as honorable. He married his wife \nin September 1973, and they have two adult children, ages 29 and 26 (GE 1). \n \nThirty days after his retirement, Applicant began working for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, and has been working for the same employer ever \nsince (Tr. 8). Applicant was granted access to classified information at the secret level \naround 1969 after completion of Radioman school. His access to classified information, \nat times at the top secret level, continued throughout his 29 years of service in the \nCoast Guard. After he retired, his access to classified information at the secret level was \ncontinued to the present time as a result of his employment by a defense contractor (Tr. \n5). Applicant explained he does not handle classified information. He manages \ncontractor personnel providing information technology (IT) support to government \nagencies and needs access to classified areas to provide IT support. There is no \nevidence that Applicant has ever compromised classified information or that he has \nfailed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of classified \ninformation. \n \nIn his June 2005 e-QIP (GE 1), Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 28(a) \n(asking whether in the last seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebts), and to question 28(b) (asking whether he was currently 90 days delinquent on \nany debts). However, he failed to disclose the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded his interview by a government agent in March 2006, his August 2007 response \nto DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), and the review of credit bureau reports (CBRs) from \nJuly 2005 (GE 4), May 2007 (GE 5), and September 2007 (GE 3). At his hearing, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nconsistent with his answers to the DOHA interrogatories, Applicant claimed he did not \ndisclose the alleged debts because he believed both debts were either paid or settled. \n \nThe delinquent $6,264 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1a concerns a time share Applicant \nand his wife purchased in April 1999. After approximately one year making payments, \nApplicant realized he could not afford the payments and returned the property to the \nseller. He claimed he was assessed no penalties or charges after breaking his contract \nand returning the property. He believed the debt was settled in full. Applicant claimed he \nfirst realized the time share debt was delinquent when he was confronted with it by a \ngovernment background investigator during his March 2006 interview. He averred that \nsince returning the property in 1999, he had no contact with the creditor and received no \ncollection notices regarding the time share debt. He further claimed that if he had known \nthe time share debt was outstanding, he would have paid it during one of the three \ntimes he refinanced his home (Tr. 22-24). \n \nApplicant stated that after he was confronted with the delinquent debt in March \n2006, his wife attempted to contact the creditor several times to resolve the debt. He \naverred the creditor never returned her calls or correspondence (Tr. 31-35). Other than \nhis testimony, and a letter he mailed to the creditor on January 2008 (AE 1) (asking for \ninformation on the account), Applicant presented no evidence to support his claims that \nhe was allowed to return the time share without financial penalties, that the account was \nsettled in full upon his return of the time share, and that he made attempts to settle or \nresolve this debt between March 2006 and his hearing date. \n \nThe delinquent $10,440 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1b concern student loans made \nby Applicant to pay for his daughter\u2019s college education. Applicant\u2019s daughter attended \ncollege from October 1996 to December 1997. At his hearing, Applicant admitted he \nobtained four student loans to pay for his daughter\u2019s education (Tr. 36-44). Based on \nthe July 2005 CBR (GE 4), he took out the first loan in November 1996 for $14,852. \nBetween approximately August 2000 and August 2002, when the loan was paid off, it \nwas over 120 days delinquent for five consecutive moths (GE 4 at p. 9). The second \nloan was obtained in July 1997 for $8,918. The loan has been delinquent and in \ncollection since around January 2000. The third loan was obtained in January 2000 for \n$10,440. The loan has been in collection since around May 2005. The fourth loan was \nobtained in August 2003, for $23,270. The loan was in collection when it was paid off in \nFebruary 2004. \n \nApplicant claimed he paid all four of his daughter\u2019s student loans during one of \nthe three times he refinanced his home. He further claimed that when he submitted his \nJune 2005 security clearance application, he believed some of the loans were \noutstanding, but not delinquent because they were in forbearance. At his hearing, \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence to corroborate his claim that all four \nloans were paid. He explained that since the student loans were no longer reflected in \nhis last two 2007 CBRs (GE 4 and 5), he believed the CBR were sufficient to \nestablished he paid the student loans. After the hearing, I granted Applicant additional \ntime to submit documents to corroborate his claims that he settled the time share debt \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nin 1999, that he attempted to contact the creditor of the time share loan to resolve the \ndebt, and that he paid the two remaining student loans. Applicant failed to present any \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his claims. \n \nApplicant testified his financial problems were caused by his wife not being able \nto work due to an accident (Tr. 83). She broke her shoulder in 2003 and underwent \nextensive medical treatment and rehabilitation. She started to work again in the spring \nof 2007. When she was working, she made approximately $35,000 a year, which she \ncontributed to the household finances. Applicant believes that since his wife is working \nagain he will be able to resolve any possible financial problems.  \n \nApplicant bought his home in 1996 for approximately $190,000. His mortgage \npayment was around $1,700. He has refinanced his home three times, the last two \ntimes were in February 2004 and May 2005. He refinanced twice to pay loans, credit \ncards, and other debts. The last time he took some equity out, and paid some debts (Tr. \n69-74). Applicant\u2019s most recent CBR, from September 2007, shows 33 accounts, four of \nwhich were in collection or charged off. He paid two of the debts after they were \ncharged off (one of the student loans). Two debts remain which are identified as \ncharged off in the CBR, a Military Star credit card debt owing $1,016, and the debt to \nPlantation Resort, owing $6,264 (GE 3). \n \nApplicant is a valuable employee with a good record working for a defense \ncontractor providing support to numerous federal agencies. There is no evidence to \nshow he has ever failed to comply with the rules and regulations required to handle \nclassified information. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant has three delinquent debts that have been charged off or in collection \nsince 1997, 1999, and 2000, totaling approximately $25,600. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts; and, AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG & 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), I find that only \nAG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies \u2013 Applicant paid two student loans and other debts after \nthey were in collection or charged off. Concerning the other mitigating conditions, none \napply. More specifically, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply, because Applicant\u2019s behavior is \nrecent as his debts are still outstanding.  \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence attempting to establish a circumstance \nbeyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts, i.e., his wife\u2019s 2003 \ninjury, her inability to work, and the resulting deficiency to the household income. \nHowever, all three debts were already delinquent prior to his wife\u2019s injury. There is no \nrecord evidence to suggest Applicant had any other circumstances beyond his control \nthat contributed to his financial problems (AG \u00b6 20(b)). The record evidence is not \nsufficient to fully establish that circumstances beyond his control contributed to his \ninability to pay his debts, that he received financial counseling and/or that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20(c)), or that he properly disputed the \nlegitimacy of any of the debts (AG \u00b6 20(e)). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG & 15.  \n \nApplicant failed to disclose relevant information in his answers to questions \n28(a), and 28(b) of his security clearance application. Considering the record as a \nwhole, I am convinced Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the information. \nNumerous factors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: \nApplicant=s maturity, his employment history, his demeanor and testimony, the number \nand value of the debts, his long term disregard of the debts, and the lack of credibility of \nhis explanations.  \n \nMoreover, Applicant was provided ample opportunity to corroborate all his claims \nand explanations, and he failed to do so. Because of his extensive experience in the \nCoast Guard and applying for and holding a security clearance, Applicant knew the \nimportance of accurately completing his security clearance application, and \nnevertheless failed to provide information that was material to making an informed \nsecurity decision. AG \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\u201d applies. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \nAG & 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it does not \napply since his behavior is recent and shows Applicant\u2019s lack of reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well trained \nman. He honorably served 29 years in the Coast Guard, and has been successful \nworking for a defense contractor for around nine years. He has held access to classified \ninformation at the secret level for approximately 38 years. There is no evidence to show \nApplicant has ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. \nBecause of his rank and years of service in the Coast Guard, and his many years \nholding access to classified information, Applicant knew or should have known the \nimportance of the trust placed on him by the government. He failed to be candid and \nhonest, in his security clearance application, and broke the trust placed on him. His \nbehavior shows he lacks judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a & 1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 61 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s Degrees in Engineering. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Technical Consultant. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Over the past ten to twelve years, the Applicant has been caught in a chain of events that have caused his current financial setback and delinquent financial situation. Prior to 1995, he and his wife were accustomed to a two income home. They paid their bills on time and lived a comfortable life. In 1995, the Applicant and his wife separated and he experienced significant periods of serious financial difficulty. In 1997, they divorced and the Applicant was left with all of the debt from the marriage, which included mortgages on properties.

On July 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 13, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe undersigned on October 11, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 29,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for February 26, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented eight exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 8.  The Applicant\npresented four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D.  He also\ntestified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 5, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 61 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s Degrees in\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Technical Consultant.  He is\nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nOver the past ten to twelve years, the Applicant has been caught in a chain of\nevents that have caused his current financial setback and delinquent financial situation.\nPrior to 1995, he and his wife were accustomed to a two income home.  They paid their\nbills on time and lived a comfortable life.  In 1995, the Applicant and his wife separated\nand he experienced significant periods of serious financial difficulty.  In 1997, they\ndivorced and the Applicant was left with all of the debt from the marriage, which\nincluded mortgages on properties.  Unbeknownst to the Applicant his wife had ran up\n$50,000.00 in credit card debt that he also had to pay.  His wife received a house that\nwas free and clear of debt.   \nTo further complicate his financial situation, in 1998, he was diagnosed with\nprostate cancer and underwent surgery and radiation.  He is now physically restricted\nfrom doing certain types of work.  (Tr. p. 32).  He applied for over 100 jobs but his\nsearch for suitable employment was unsuccessful.  To pay his debts, the Applicant\nliquidated all of  assets, except for a house he owns in another state.  He sold a piece of\nproperty he owned, (59 acres), sold personal property of any value, cashed in his\nretirement accounts and reduced his living expenses (eliminating his health insurance)\nand relied on his credit cards to pay his living expenses.  In 2003, when he sold his\npersonal property to pay his debts he did not pay his taxes.  By January 2001, the\nApplicant had run out of money.  (See Government Exhibit 3).  \nIn 2001, a consulting company offered him a two year contract.  He took the job\nand later found out that the company was unethical.  Eight months later they fired him\nand the Applicant was forced to sue the company.  In 2002, the Applicant received a\nsettlement of $225,000.00.  He used half of the settlement money to pay down his credit\ncard bills.  (Tr. p. 60).    \nIn November 2005, the Applicant formed his own company, at the request of the\nUnited States military to undertake a research and development study contract that they\nwere anticipating.  The Applicant was excited about the opportunity and relied on the\nanticipation of the contract.  He expended significant time, money and energy on the\n\n3\norganization and planning of the project that was not reimbursed.  It was expected that\nthe contract had planned funding in excess of $500,000.00.  Throughout this period,\nalthough difficult, the Applicant was still making payments on his credit cards.  In 2006,\nthrough no fault of the Applicant, the project was cancelled, the funds were re-directed\nand the Applicant was left without employment.        \nFor the past two years, the Applicant has been unemployed.  The Applicant has\nbeen unable to pay his credit card bills.  In an effort to do something about his\ndelinquent financial situation, the Applicant contacted an attorney.  He was advised that\nhe would not qualify for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy because he owns a house in another\nstate.  On his own, the Applicant contacted the IRS concerning his delinquent tax debt\nand told them to place a lien on his house.  He also wrote letters to each of his creditors\nand proposed to place with a third party trustee who would auction it off and the\nproceeds would go to his creditors.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  The Applicant did not\nreceive a response from any of his creditors.\nThe only significant asset that the Applicant has is his house.  He had been\nhesitant to sell it to pay his credit card debt without knowing where he would work or live\nin the future.                            \nRecently the Applicant has found part-time work through his new company on a\none year assignment for a defense contractor.    \nThe Applicant currently owes each of the eleven debts set forth in the SOR.  His\nstrategy is to pay each of them on a case by case basis as they pursue the legal options\navailable to them.  A debt to the IRS for a federal tax lien filed against him in October\n2006, in the approximate amount of $32,891.00 remains outstanding.  A delinquent debt\nowed to Bank of America in the amount of $18,307.00 remains outstanding.  A\ndelinquent debt to Bank of America in the amount of $25,620.00 remains outstanding.\nA delinquent debt to Bank of America in the amount of $28,380.00 remains outstanding.\nA delinquent debt to Chase in the amount of $18,814.00 remains outstanding.  A\ndelinquent debt to Citi in the amount of $21,035.00 remains outstanding.  A delinquent\ndebt to Citi in the amount of $24,493.00 remains outstanding.  A delinquent debt to Citi\nin the amount of $8,074.00 remains outstanding.  A delinquent debt to Portfolio/MBNA\nin the amount of $10,164.00 remains outstanding.  A delinquent debt to WFB -NE in the\namount of $7,891.00 remains outstanding.  A delinquent debt to WACHOVIA in the\namount of $15,497.00 remains outstanding.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D and\nGovernment Exhibits 2, 4 and 8 and Tr. pp. 57-58).   \nA letter of recommendation from an individual who knows the Applicant both on a\nprofessional and personal basis, and who was the Government project officer managing\nthe overall project that the Applicant had hoped to get until it was cancelled, indicates\nthat the Applicant is highly trusted and an extremely capable colleague associated with\nimportant national defense work for the past 30 years and that he should be granted a\nsecurity clearance.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nthat is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears\nthe ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant her a security clearance.\n\n6\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe Applicant admits that he is presently $180,000.00 in debt.  He has no money\nto pay his bills and his only asset left is his house that he has not yet sold.  Admittedly,\nhe has suffered a series of financial setbacks over the past twelve years.   Many of\nthese circumstances have been beyond his control.  Namely, his marital separation,\ndivorce, illness, treatment, business downturn, underemployment and unemployment,\nand project cancellation have all contributed to his present financial situation.  Up to this\npoint, he has sold all of his assets to pay his debts except for his house.  He has\nproposed to his creditors that they sell his house at auction and take the proceeds.\nThey have not responded.  He is simply waiting for the next shoe to fall.  \nUnder a similar fact scenario where an individual has taken some productive\naction to resolve his financial indebtedness, and there is a set plan in place, Mitigation\nCondition 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances could apply.  However, under the particular facts\nof this case, the Applicant has not made even one payment toward any of the eleven\ndebts listed in the SOR, nor has he set up any payment plans to do so.   \nApplying the Guidelines of DoD directive 5520.6, the Applicant has not started to\nreduce his delinquent federal tax debt and other excessive credit card debt, and has a\nlong way to go before it is resolved.  He has not presented sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or that he has resolved his\nfinancial indebtedness.  Upon review of his financial statement, it does not appear that\nhe has any disposable income at the end of the month to pay his delinquent debts.\nGiven the large amount of debt that he owes, and the fact that he has not yet made\neven one payment toward the debt, there is little evidence of financial rehabilitation at\nthis time.  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  His financial problems\nremain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good\nfaith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. Based upon the\nevidence presented, this Administrative Judge is given no other option than to deny the\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not\nintroduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to\novercome the Government's case. \n\n7\n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                         Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                         Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nApplicant for personal conduct and criminal conduct under Guidelines E and J.  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 20, 2008. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2008.  He admitted the \nallegations under both Guidelines J and E with explanation, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July \n28, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on July 30, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on August 6, 2008, for a hearing on September 10, 2008.  I convened the \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhearing as scheduled.  The government offered nine government exhibits, marked \n(Gov. Ex.) 1 through 9, which were received without objection.  Two other administrative \nexhibits (Gov. Ex. 10-11) were received.  Applicant submitted two Applicant Exhibits, \nmarked (App. Ex.) A-B, which were received without objection.  Applicant and one \nApplicant witness testified on his behalf.  The record was left open for Applicant to \nsubmit additional documents.  Applicant timely submitted four documents marked App. \nEx. C-F.  The documents were admitted into the record without objection (Gov. Ex. 11).  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 18, 2008.  Based upon \na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 43 years old.  He entered active duty with the Navy after high school \nat age 17 and served as a cryptologist for 20 years from 1983 until retiring as a petty \nofficer first class (E-6) in July 2003.  He held a security clearance with access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) while on active duty.  When Applicant retired \nand started work for a defense contractor in July 2003, he reapplied in August 2003 for \nhis security clearance to be continued.  It was granted in November 2003.  He started \nworking as an analyst for his present defense contractor employer in October 2005.  He \nprovided his e-QIP in February 2006 as a periodic up-date of his security clearance (Tr. \n28-30, 33-34; Gov. Ex 1, Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP), \ndated February 22, 2006).   \n \nApplicant married his first wife while he was on active duty in 1990.  They \nseparated in late 1999.  She filed for divorce in July 2001, and the divorce was granted \nin September 2001.  There were no children from this marriage. (Tr. 28-32; App. Ex. A, \nCivil summons, dated July 10, 2001; App. Ex. B, Judgment, dated September 7, 2001).  \n \nApplicant had four heart-related medical problems.  He suffered a heart attack \nwhile on active duty in 1993.  He had another heart attack while on active duty in 1998.  \nHe received a triple coronary bypass while on active duty in 2002.  His fourth cardiac \nincident was in 2006 after he retired and working for the defense contractor.  Plague \nbroke from his arteries causing a blockage.  His oxygen supply to the brain was cut for \nabout 17 minutes and he almost expired.  He experienced brain anoxia and short term \nmemory loss.  He awoke thinking that he was back in the Navy, and asking for his \nformer girlfriend Ms. B.  He was in rehabilitation for over six months from April until \nOctober 2006 before returning to work with normal neurologic function and judgment \n(Tr. 26-28, 43-45; App. Ex. C, Psychologist Letter, dated September 23, 2008; App. Ex. \nD, Treatment Letter, dated September 22, 2008; App. Ex. E, Doctor's Letter, dated \nSeptember 26, 2008). \n \nApplicant and his first wife lived in State A when he was on his penultimate \nassignment on active duty.  His wife left the home but Applicant continued to live in the \nhouse because the housing market was not favorable for sellers.  Applicant's last duty \nassignment on active duty was in neighboring State B.  He remained in his house in \n\n \n3 \n \n \nState A and commuted to work.  After his wife left him, he met in 2000 through a mutual \nfriend Ms. B who lived and worked close to Applicant's duty station in State B.  Applicant \nwas able to rent his house in State A and eventually sell it.  He moved to a \ncondominium in State B in 2002.  Applicant and Ms. B never lived together but did visit \neach other.  Applicant and Ms. B had a relationship until they became estranged and \nparted company in July 2002.  This was shortly after his April 2002 by-pass operation.  \nApplicant did not know why Ms. B left but indicated she told him after his by-pass \noperation the he \"had changed.\"  Applicant was angry at Ms. B because she never \nadequately explained the reason why she terminated their relationship (Tr. 37-39).  \nApplicant moved in with his mother in neighboring State C to recover and rehabilitate \nfrom his by-pass operation.  After leaving active duty, he stayed in State C, purchased a \nhome, met another woman in August 2005, and married her in September 2006 (Tr. 42-\n43). \n \nApplicant was angry with Ms. B about her leaving him in July 2002.  In November \n2004, he sent her an e-mail message stating \"X (former boyfriend of Ms. B), asked me \nto make your life hell, and so it shall be.  Your mistake will live with you forever\" (Tr. 41, \nGov. Ex. 5, e-mail message, dated November 14, 2004).  Applicant was still angry with \nMs. B even after he married his present wife in September 2006.  He was at the time \nstill recovering from the brain anoxia.  He sent Ms. B an e-mail on October 13, 2006, \nthreatening to inform her employer about certain of her actions.  He used indecent, \nvulgar, profane and lewd language.  He accused Ms. B of having taken inappropriate \nactions against him (Tr. 48-49; Gov. Ex. 6, e-mail, dated October 13, 2006; Gov. Ex. 7, \nsame e-mail forwarded to Ms. B's employer by her, dated October 13, 2006).  Applicant \nsent Ms. B another e-mail in November 2006 that was similar in nature again using \nindecent, vulgar, profane, and lewd language (App. Ex. 8, e-mail, dated November 3, \n2006).  On November 8, 2006, Ms. B swore out a warrant of arrest for Applicant for \nviolation of State B's criminal statute against use of a computer to communicate \nobscene, vulgar, profane, lewd, lascivious, or indecent language or threaten an illegal or \nimmoral act with the intent to coerce, intimate, or harass another person (Gov. Ex. 3, \nWarrant of Arrest, dated November 8, 2006, See, Hearing Exhibit 1, State B Statute \u00a7 \n18.2-152.7.1 Harassment by computer, penalty, Class 1, Misdemeanor).  Applicant's \nemployer filed the necessary incident report concerning Applicant's arrest with security \nauthorities (Gov. Ex. 10, Incident History, dated November 15, 2006).   \n \nApplicant learned of the arrest warrant when he was questioned by security \ninvestigators for the periodic update of his security clearance in January 2007.  \nThereafter, he sent Ms. B a fourth e-mail threatening to disclose to her employer and \nthe local criminal authorities a theft of material from the employer unless she withdrew \nthe warrant of arrest (Gov. Ex. 9, e-mail, dated March 16, 2007).  Ms. B swore out a \nsecond warrant of arrest against Applicant based on the latest e-mail (Gov. Ex. 4, \nWarrant of Arrest, dated March 22, 2007).  Applicant voluntarily turned himself into \nauthorities in State B on October 30, 2007.  He pled guilty in December 2007 to \nHarassment by computer (See, Gov. Ex. 3 and Gov Ex. 4, Warrant of Arrest, dated \nNovember 8, 2006 and March 22, 2007).  He received deferred adjudication for six \nmonths, charged court costs, and directed not to have any contact with Ms. B for six \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmonths.  Applicant completed the period of deferred adjudication and the charges were \ndismissed on June 19, 2008 (See, Attorney letter, dated June 22, 2008, attached to the \nResponse to the SOR, dated July 14, 2008).  Applicant did not know that sending \nprofane, lewd and threatening e-mails was a criminal offense.  He now knows that and \nstated he would never again send such an e-mail (Tr. 28) \n \nApplicant had not been in contact with or seen Ms. B since their breakup in July \n2002.  He had been in contact with her mother and brother and the mutual friend who \nintroduced them.  They left him with the impression he should still try to get back \ntogether with her.  He does not know why he sent the November 2004 e-mail except he \nwas still in love with her and was the distant ex-boyfriend waiting for her to change her \nmind.  He learned that Ms. B was getting married to a person she had known and even \ndated while Applicant was in the hospital and at home recovering from his brain anoxia.  \nApplicant does not know why he sent the e-mails except he was the rejected suitor of \nMs. B.  He was recovering from his recent brain injury when he sent the e-mails but did \nnot entirely consider this as the reason for his action in sending the e-mails (Tr. 65-71; \nGov. Ex. 2, Applicant Affidavit, dated February 21, 2008). \n \nApplicant's supervisor testified that Applicant worked for him both before and \nafter his April 2006 heart incident.  The witness was permitted to see the Applicant in \nthe hospital about a week after the heart incident when Applicant woke up.  He was \nadvised by the hospital staff the Applicant would act slightly strange.  When he saw \nApplicant, Applicant was very much living in the past.  He could tell that Applicant was \nabout eight or ten years in the past when he thought the witness was his Navy chief.  \nApplicant over time did return to the present and his medical condition improved.  It took \nhim about two months to be solidly in line with his current life, and four to six months to \nbe back to normal.  He had no concerns about Applicant's reliability and trustworthiness \nbefore his April 2006 heart incident.  He believes Applicant can be entrusted with \naccess to classified information (Tr. 80-90)   \n \nThe government integrated product team leader on Applicant's projects has \nknown Applicant since August 2003 when Applicant started working for defense \ncontractors on projects under his authority.  He noted Applicant's heart-related medical \nproblem in April 2006 and Applicant's recovery and returning to work on the project.  He \nhas continued full trust in Applicant in his work and in safeguarding classified \ninformation (App. Ex. F, Letter, dated September 23, 2008). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \n \nThe e-mails sent by Applicant to Ms. B on October 17, and November 3, 2006, \nand March 16, 2007, were charged by State B as violations of the state criminal statute \nfor harassment by computer.  Applicant pled guilty to these offenses in the same trial \nand was sentenced.  The SOR allegation concerning Criminal Conduct under Guideline \nJ is based on this conviction.  The personal conduct Guideline E allegation is also \nbased on the acts involved in this conviction.  I have not considered the November 2004 \ne-mail as a violation of criminal law since it was not charged by State B.  However, I will \nconsider it in the context of the whole person in regard to a personal conduct Guideline \n\n \n6 \n \n \nE security concern. Since the same acts raise both a criminal conduct and personal \nconduct security concern, I will consider them together. \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).  Personal conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information (AG \u00b6 15).  Appellant\u2019s action in sending \nobscene, vulgar, lewd, and threatening e-mail in violation of a state statute raises \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses), CD DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted); Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) \u00b6 16(c) (credible \nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an \nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as \na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or other characteristic indicating hat the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information); and PC DC \u00b6 (16(e) (personal conduct, or \nconcealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing, . . . ).  \nApplicant's admission to and conviction of the criminal offense of harassment by \ncomputer for sending three e-mails in violation of state statute are multiple lesser \noffenses and allegations of criminal conduct.  The act of sending threatening e-mail \nusing profane and vulgar language is activity that could affect Applicant's personal, \nprofession, or community standing. \n \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) \u00b6 32 (a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); CC MC \u00b6 \n32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement); Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability trustworthiness, or good judgment); and PC MC \u00b6 17(e) (the \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress).  The mitigating conditions for both the personal conduct and \ncriminal conduct security concerns under the circumstances are similar.  They involve \nconsideration of the minor nature of the offense, the passage of time, and the unusual \nor unique circumstances of the events to show that the events are unlikely to recur.  \nAlso the mitigating conditions under both guidelines consider that rehabilitation or \npositive steps can establish mitigation. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant's actions in sending the e-mails were those of a spurned suitor who \nwas upset that he was rejected by the victim.  There were three e-mails sent to Ms. B \nthat violated the criminal statute and amount to inappropriate personal conduct.  They \nwere vulgar and obscene and threatening.  However, Applicant did not act on his \nthreats and did nothing more than let his frustrations out in the e-mails.  He did not \ncheck the e-mails or his frustration level before hitting the send button.  The offenses \nare minor as shown by the sentence of deferred adjudication and dismissal of the case \nafter the period of deferment.  The events happened under unique circumstances.  \nApplicant had a severe heart condition and almost expired.  He had short term memory \nloss.  Since then, he recovered medically and is successfully working for his employer.  \nHe has shown remorse for his action in sending the e-mails.  All of these factors show \nthat his action amounting to criminal and person conduct of security concern are \nunlikely to recur.  Applicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate the personal \nconduct and criminal conduct security concerns.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant served 20 \nyears on active duty in the Navy and successfully held a security clearance during that \ntime.  I considered that Applicant has been successful since leaving the Navy.  I have \nconsidered Applicant's heart-related medical condition and his recovery.  I note the \nopinion of both his supervisor and the government representative on his projects that he \ncan be trusted to protect classified information.  Applicant's conduct in sending the \ninappropriate e-mails to his former girlfriend are criminal and wrong, but I consider his \nactions as minor criminal and personal conduct transgressions.  At the time that he sent \nthe messages, he did not know they were considered by the state as criminal acts in \nviolation of a statute.  Applicant now knows that his actions are criminal, he is \nremorseful, and he established that he is rehabilitated.  He has established that this \ntype of criminal and personal conduct is unlikely to recur.  Overall, on balance the \nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsuitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his personal and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the potential mitigating \nconditions, and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) Athe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,@ AG & 20(b) Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ AG & 20(c) Athe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control,@ AG & 20(d) Athe individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,@ and AG & 20(e) \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. There is no evidence that Applicant paid \nany of the other debts as alleged in the SOR. That is insufficient evidence to conclude \nApplicant made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts. She disputed two of the debts, but did not submit documentation to substantiate \nher dispute. There is no evidence as to what caused Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Nor \nis there evidence of financial counseling. I do not find any of the mitigating conditions \napplicable.  \n \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of financial \ndelinquencies. She settled one debt and indicated she had a plan to pay her other \ndebts. She provided very little additional information about herself.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on her financial issues. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nEdward W.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated June 30, 2008, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR. 2 Applicant, who is 57 years old, enlisted in the United States Navy in June 1970 and received an honorable discharge in July 1977. He immediately began working for the Navy in a civilian capacity. During his years of civilian service, he completed many training programs and received awards and honors. In 1985, the Navy granted him a security clearance, which he continues to hold. The record contains no evidence he failed to follow security procedures while working. He retired from federal civilian employment in 2005, after 27 years of service. 3 In November 2005, he began working as a staff logistics engineer for a Department of Defense contractor.

On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H, E and\nJ for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 21, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on July 24, 2008.\nNovember 5, 2008\n\nGE 6 consists of an unsworn personal interview statement of Applicant, titled as \u201ctestimonies\u201d. The Directive\n1\nprohibits the use of this document unless it is received with an authenticating witness. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.\nThe government did not authenticate this exhibit and Applicant objected to its admission. GE 7 and GE 8 are\n\u201ctestimonies\u201d which the government authenticated.

DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 29, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 15, 2008.\nThe government offered eight exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were received and\nmarked. Applicant objected to the admission of GE 6. All exhibits were admitted into\nevidence without objection, except GE 6, which was not admitted into evidence.1\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non October 23, 2008. I held the record open until October 24, 2008, for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters.  On October 24, 2008, he submitted additional documents\nwhich have been marked as AE A through H and admitted into evidence, without\nobjection. The record closed on October 24, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on October 3, 2008. (Tr. 9) I advised\nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive the hearing notice 15\ndays notice before the hearing date. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 9-10) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 30, 2008, Applicant admitted all the factual\nallegations in the SOR.   \n2\nApplicant, who is 57 years old, enlisted in the United States Navy in June 1970\nand received an honorable discharge in July 1977. He immediately began working for\nthe Navy in a civilian capacity. During his years of civilian service, he completed many\ntraining programs and received awards and honors. In 1985, the Navy granted him a\nsecurity clearance, which he continues to hold. The record contains no evidence he\nfailed to follow security procedures while working.

He works\nwell with co-workers and customers.4\nApplicant was married for 15 years and has been divorced for sometime. His\nformer wife died a few years ago. They had two children, a daughter, age 36, and a son,\nage 31. He also has a granddaughter, age 19, two grandsons, ages 17 and 13, and a\ngreat-grandchild. At the time of the hearing, his son, his father, and two grandsons were\nliving with him. He provides some support for these family members. Over the years, he\nhas worked in his community, on a variety of committees or projects. He works with the\nyouth in his neighborhood, trying to provide guidance to them.5\nIn the late 1970s, Applicant started smoking marijuana occasionally with\nVietnam veterans. When he married, he stopped his recreational use of marijuana for a\nperiod of time. He started smoking marijuana again when he divorced and continued to\nuse it occasionally until 2007. He smokes marijuana to relax and to celebrate events,\nsuch as his birthday. He sometimes purchased marijuana, but never sold, manufactured\nor distributed marijuana. In February 2003, the police arrested him and charged him\nwith the purchase and possession of marijuana. He pled guilty. The court fined him,\nrequired him to attend a drug class, and placed him on probation without verdict for 12\nmonths.6\nIn July 2003, while visiting his mother in the south, the police arrested him for\ndriving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He spent the night in jail. His family\nbailed him out of jail the next day. He never appeared in court or pled to the charges\nagainst him. After paying his bail, which he characterized as a fine, he never heard\nanymore from the authorities in this state about his arrest.  \n7\nOn his birthday in October 2003, the police arrested and charged him with\npossession of cocaine and marijuana. Prior to his arrest, he used cocaine on a few\noccasions over several years. He has not used cocaine since his arrest. He pled guilty\nto the charges. The court sentenced him as a first offender and required him to attend a\nfirst offender\u2019s class, which he did. The record contains no information on this arrest,\nexcept for Applicant\u2019s testimony and information provided to the investigator.  \n8\n\nGE 1, supra note 6, at 16-18; Tr. 70-71, 87.\n9\nGE 4, supra note 7, at 3; GE 8 (Testimonies of personal subject interview on March 16, 2006) at 3-5; Tr. 34.\n10\nGE 2, supra note 6, at 5-7.\n11\nTr. 55-59, 64-65, 71-79, 82, 93-98.\n12\n4\nWhen he completed his SF-86 on August 10, 2006, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nQuestion 23d, indicating that he had been arrested in October 2001 for possession of\nmarijuana and to Question 24a, listing two occasions in 2001 for his marijuana use. He\ndid not list his other two arrests or acknowledge his extensive and more recent use of\nmarijuana. Applicant used the wrong date for the arrest he listed. At the hearing, he did\nnot provide a reason for his failure to provide more details about his past drug use or his\nfailure to list his arrest in February 2003. He did not believe his DUI arrest in July 2003\nwas relevant, so he did not list it.9\nIn March 2006, Applicant met with an investigator to discuss issues raised by his\nanswers in his SF-86. During this interview, he told the investigator he had been\narrested in February 2003 for purchasing and possessing marijuana, in July 2003 for\nDUI, and in October 2003 for drug and alcohol use. He provided the investigator with\ndetailed information about the facts surrounding these arrests and about his use of\nmarijuana and cocaine. Based on this information provided by Applicant during the\ninterview, the investigator prepared a report. She did not request nor did she have his\ncriminal arrest record when she interviewed him. His criminal arrest record was\nrequested more than five months after this interview.10\nApplicant also provided information regarding his arrests in his interview in\nAugust 2007. In this interview, he provided limited information about his use of\nmarijuana, stating that he used it in the 1970s and twice later, in October 2001 and for\nthe last time in later 2003 or early 2004. He also acknowledged using cocaine on two\noccasions, October 2003 and March 2004 for the last time. Although he attended a\ncourt mandated drug class after his February 2003 arrest and a court mandated first\noffenders class after his October 2003 arrest, he is not dependent on drugs and has not\nreceived drug counseling or treatment. The interviewer concluded her report by noting\nthat Applicant was not able to remember the particulars of all the incidents.11\n \nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged his drug use. He started with marijuana\nin the 1970s, stopped during his marriage, and resumed smoking marijuana after his\ndivorce. He also admitted that he used cocaine maybe two or three times a year with a\ngirlfriend. He no longer dates this women, and has not used cocaine since 2004. He last\nused marijuana in 2007 to celebrate his birthday. He testified that although he knew\nmarijuana and cocaine were illegal, he did not realize he could did not use drugs while\nholding a clearance or that he could be fired if he tested positive for drugs.  \n12\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and,\n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and\nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\nApplicant used marijuana in the 1970s and for many years since his divorce. For\na number of years he also used cocaine occasionally. He possessed both drugs and\nsometimes purchased marijuana. He knows both drugs are illegal. Even with this\nknowledge, he still used both while holding a security clearance. He last used cocaine in\n2004 and marijuana in October 2007. He has not clearly and convincingly established a\ncommitment not to use marijuana again.  He enjoys the effects of marijuana, which is\nthe reason for his continued use of it on occasion. The above disqualifying conditions\n\nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n13\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these\ndrugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and,\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited\nto rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified.\nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant is a current drug user and the evidence of record does not establish\n14\nthat he is a current user of marijuana. See 50 U.S.C. \u00b6 435c(b).\n7\nare established.  I have considered the mitigating conditions and conclude that none\n13\napply. Guideline H, drug involvement is found against Applicant.14\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n15\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cyes\u201d to Questions 23d and 24a, but failed to provide complete\ninformation about his arrests and drug use. This information is material to the evaluation\nof Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. He\ndenies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these questions. When a\nfalsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.\nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the\nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\n15\nomission, concealment or falsification in his answers to these questions was deliberate.\nApplicant admits that he did not consider his DUI arrest relevant and thus, did not\nprovide the information about this arrest. He could not provide any reason for not listing\nall his arrests, which he knew had occurred. He intentionally failed to provide full and\naccurate answers to Question 23d and 24a. The above disqualifying conditions apply in\nthis case. \nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Although he failed to\nprovide full and complete information in his SF-86 about his arrests and drug use,\nApplicant voluntarily provided information about his three arrests and extensive drug\nuse to the investigator during his March 16, 2006 interview without being confronted\nwith evidence of his arrests or drug use. The investigator acknowledged that she did not\nrequest his criminal records prior to this interview and that the information in her report\ncame from Applicant. Thus, AG \u00b6 (a) \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to\ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts\u201d applies. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to SOR\nallegations 2.a, 2.a(1) and 2.b.\nConcerning his inconsistent statements regarding his drug use, Applicant has\nconsistently stated that he last used cocaine in 2004. He has also provided consistent\ninformation about when he actually used marijuana. He has not provided accurate and\nconsistent information about the number of times and frequency of his cocaine and\nmarijuana use. When he initially met with the investigator in March 2006, he provided\ninformation about his long use of marijuana and cocaine which coincides with his\nhearing testimony.  The interviewer noted his lack of memory about many details on the\nissues discussed. In his later interview, he provided less information about his drug use.\nGiven that the government already had better information about his drug use from the\nprior interview, his statements in his 2007 interview are not a deliberate intent to hide\ninformation from the government, but the result of poor recall and miscommunication.\nSOR allegation 2.c is found in favor of Applicant.\n\n9\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nIn light of my findings under Guideline E, Guideline J is found against Applicant.\nBeing honest later is not a defense to an 18 U.S.C. \u00b6 1001 violation.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nworked for the Navy and the federal government for more than 27 years without any\ndisciplinary actions taken against him. He was a reliable employee and continued with\nhis excellent work ethic in his private sector job. His current employer praises his work.\nHe has worked in his community for many years to help the youth. He takes of his father\nand grandchildren. He is responsible towards his family, his finances and his\ncommunity. His efforts to provide guidance to the youth of his community is\ncommendable.\nWhen he used the illegal drugs marijuana and cocaine while holding a security\nclearance, Applicant breached a special trust . He used these drugs not once, but\nmultiple times between 1985, when he was granted his security clearance, and 2004.\nEach time he used marijuana or cocaine, he knew he was breaking the law. I do not find\nhis statement that he did not know he could not use illegal drugs while holding a\nsecurity clearance credible. Common sense would tell him that illegal drug use would\nnot be acceptable behavior while holding a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s decision to\nuse marijuana and cocaine showed poor judgment and sets a poor example for the\nyouth he is trying to help. His decision shows a disregard for the rules and laws of\nsociety and for holding a security clearance. Furthermore, given his long history of\nrecreational marijuana use, I am not convinced he will not use it in the future. Applicant\n\n10\nhas not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his security worthiness and\ntrustworthiness.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement and\ncriminal conduct. He has mitigated the security concerns about his personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a (1)\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 8, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \n \n1On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nAugust 11, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nconcerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), E (Personal Conduct), and J \n(Criminal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn December 21, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 6, 2008, was provided to her, \nand she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did not submit any information within the 30-day \ntime period after receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was originally assigned to \nanother administrative judge on June 16, 2008, and due to case load considerations \nwas reassigned to me on July 18, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a. and 2.b., and \nneither admitted or denied 3.a.3 She admitted the remaining SOR allegations. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. I make the following additional \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old Counselor and Director of Student Services, who has \nworked for her government contractor employer since July 2005. She has also been \nemployed as Chief Executive Officer and President of another company since April \n2004.4 She holds a Certificate in Advanced Graduate Studies awarded in May 2001, \nand has completed course work for a Ph.D. in Education, but has not completed her \nthesis.

Of those debts, 12 are defaulted student loans. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. \u2013 1.m.) Per the April 2007 credit bureau report, a charged off department \nstore credit account in the amount of $5,466 has been settled and shows a zero \nbalance.11 (SOR \u00b6 1.t.) The majority of these debts became delinquent in 2005\nti\nApplicant offered no documentation that any of her debts have been paid, that \nshe has set up payment plans, nor has she submitted any evidence that she contacted \nany creditors or sought credit counseling or that her debts are or will be resolved. In her \nResponses to Interrogatories, Applicant submitted evidence that she was unemployed \nfrom June 2002 to December 2003 following her voluntary termination as Dean of \nStudent Life at a prepara\nfo\nShe also submitted a letter from a physician describing her mother\u2019s illness, \nwhich includes metastastic cancer, sleep apnea, and congestive heart failure. The \nphysician also stated that in addition to Applicant caring for her mother, she is/or will be \ncaring for two aunts. One aunt has suffered a stroke and has Paget\u2019s disease and \nhypertension and is unable to drive. A second aunt has rheumatoid arthritis and \nw\nApplicant\u2019s documentation does not mention when and to what extent Applicant \nis or has been providing care for her family members.

She \nexplained in her August 2006 OPM Interview that her failure to answer the form \ncorrectly was due to an \u201coversight.\u201d15 Applicant\u2019s December 2006 Answer stated, \n\u201cWhen I started the process of getting a security clearance in the summer of 2004, my \nfinancial delinquencies were not 120 or 90 days behind. By the time my information got \nprocessed I was behind due to my inability to work.\u201d16 The record evidence reflects that \nthe debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p. were all at least 180 days delinquent \nwithin seven years of \na\n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicativ\np\nting an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person \nre\n a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions\nth\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n14 Id. \n15 Item 4. \n16 Item 2. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n decision.\u201d \nirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.

See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

After a review of the evidence, eligibility for access is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an initial security clearance application (SF 86) on December\n5, 2003. On November 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline H and Guideline E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nApril 25, 2008\n\n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 17, 2007, and requested a\nhearing. On February 11, 2008, Department Counsel indicated the government was\nprepared to proceed, but also moved to amend the SOR to include new allegations\nunder Guideline H and Guideline E, and to modify existing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.d. The\ncase was assigned to me on February 14, 2008.\nOn February 21, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for March 25, 2008. In a separate\nOrder, I gave Applicant until March 17, 2008, to file any objections and to respond to the\nproposed allegations. Applicant filed no response by the due date.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence, I\ngranted the government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR. The government\u2019s case consisted\nof 13 exhibits (Ex. 1-13). Applicant testified on his behalf and submitted three exhibits\n(Ex. A-C) that were entered without objections. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was\nreceived on April 3, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nOn February 11, 2008, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding\n\u00b6 1.g under Guideline H, alleging that Applicant was arrested in August 1996 for driving\nunder the influence (DUI). Under Guideline E, the government proposed clarifications to\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.d  to allege that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his\nDecember 2003 and August 2004 security clearance applications that he had been\ncharged with possession of marijuana and/or possession of drug paraphernalia in 1996\nand 2001. The government also proposed new allegations under Guideline E: SOR \u00b6\n2.g concerning falsification of a September 1, 2004, written statement by not revealing\nthat he had been arrested for possession of marijuana in 1996; SOR \u00b6 2.h concerning\nfalse statements in a July 7, 2006, interview, by indicating that he used marijuana four\nto five times between 1995 and 2002 when he had used marijuana daily from 1996 to\n2002; and SOR \u00b6 2.i also alleging falsification of his July 7 interview by denying any\nmarijuana use between 2002 and about July 2006.\n On February 21, 2008, I gave Applicant until  March 17, 2008, to file any\nobjections and to respond to the proposed allegations. I informed the parties that in the\nabsence of a response or of no objections, the SOR would be amended as requested.\nApplicant filed no response by the due date. After confirming with Applicant at the\nhearing that he had received the proposed SOR amendments and did not object, I\namended the SOR as requested.\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR as amended, DOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement,\nthat Applicant used marijuana on numerous occasions from about 1996 through at least\nMarch 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), including after he completed security applications in\nDecember 2003 and August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he was arrested in August 1996 for\npossession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and DUI\n(SOR \u00b6 1.g) and found guilty of possession of drug paraphernalia and DUI; that he was\narrested for DUI and possession of drug paraphernalia in February 2001 and convicted\nof DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that he pleaded nolo contendere to a November 2005 possession\nof marijuana charge (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that he was arrested while attempting to enter a\nU.S. military base in March 2007 for possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant was\nalleged under Guideline E to have deliberately falsified a December 2003 SF 86 by not\ndisclosing that he had been charged with marijuana offenses in 1996 and 2001 (SOR \u00b6\n2.a), he had used marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b), or he had purchased marijuana in college and\nafter 2002 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). He was also alleged to have falsified an August 2004 SF 86 by\nnot disclosing his marijuana charges (SOR \u00b6 2.d), his marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 2.e), and\nhis marijuana purchases (SOR \u00b6 2.f). Further, he was alleged to have falsified a\nSeptember 2004 written statement by not disclosing that he had been charged with\npossession of marijuana in 1996 (SOR \u00b6 2.g), and to have falsified material facts during\na July 2006 interview by stating that he had used marijuana about four to five times\nbetween 1995 and 2002 when he had used marijuana daily (SOR \u00b6 2.h), and by\ndenying that he had used marijuana from 2002 through July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.i). \nIn his Answer filed before the SOR was amended, Applicant admitted the\nGuideline H allegations and denied the Guideline E allegations. He attributed his\nomission of the illegal drug charges from his SF 86 to his failure to understand that\nexpunged charges had to be listed. As for his failure to disclose his use and purchase of\nmarijuana on both SF 86 forms, Applicant averred he was at the time \u201cstill very much in\ndenial\u201d about his issues with marijuana. Before the introduction of evidence at his\nhearing, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR as amended. After\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old systems engineer who has worked for his current\nemployer, a defense contractor, since late September 2003 (Ex. 1). He has held a\nsecret level security clearance since 2004, initially on an interim basis, for his duties\ninvolving software integration (Tr. 50-51).\nApplicant first tried marijuana on December 31, 1993, while at a New Year\u2019s Eve\nparty at his home. A friend brought the marijuana. During his last term in high school,\nApplicant continued to smoke marijuana once every couple of months (Tr. 52-53).\nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant attended college for a year out of\nstate. He did not use marijuana during that time (Tr. 56). He moved back home by\nSeptember 1994, and began working as a cook/dishwasher at a local restaurant (Ex. 1,\nEx. 2). In late August 1995, he matriculated to the state university (Ex. 1, Ex. 2). He\n\nApplicant told a government investigator in March 2007 that he had used marijuana from 1996 to 2002 on\n1\na daily basis in college (Ex. 5). At his hearing, he testified that his use in college was at times daily, although\nit varied and he went months at time without marijuana (Tr. 54-55). It is reasonable to infer that he used\nmarijuana with some regularity in college.\n4\nbegan smoking marijuana with new friends, and continued his marijuana use throughout\ncollege with varying frequency, up to on a daily basis.  Applicant abstained at times,\n1\nafter waking up coughing from smoking the night before and questioning why he was\npunishing his body and brain in that way. Applicant purchased marijuana from a friend\nevery couple of weeks (Tr. 54-55). Applicant had his own marijuana pipe (Tr. 56).\nApplicant was arrested twice while he was a college undergraduate. In August\n1996, after drinking seven or eight beers with friends from college, he decided to drive\nhome. At around 0100 hours, he was stopped by the police for speeding. The officer\nsaw signs of alcohol use (bloodshot and watery eyes, an odor of alcohol on breath) and\nadministered field sobriety tests. After failing the tests, Applicant was arrested for driving\nunder the influence (DUI). During a search of Applicant\u2019s vehicle incident to his arrest,\nthe police found a smoking pipe with suspected marijuana (Ex. 3, Ex. 8, Tr. 65-68).\nApplicant had smoked marijuana that night (\u201cI shared a bowl with one of the guys that I\nwas partying with during the day.\u201d Tr. 67). While at the station, Applicant gave the police\na small marijuana pipe that he had in his pocket (Ex. 8). Applicant was charged with\nDUI, possession of less than four ounces of marijuana, possession of drug\nparaphernalia, and speeding (Ex. 7). In late September 1996, he pleaded guilty to\npossession of drug paraphernalia and was fined $100 (Ex. 9, Ex. 10). The possession\nof marijuana charge was nolle prossed (Ex. 10, Tr. 69). He pleaded guilty to DUI and\nwas sentenced to a $500 fine and alcohol education classes (Ex. 3, Tr. 69, 86).\nIn early February 2001, Applicant smoked some marijuana and then consumed\nfour mixed drinks at a bar. He was stopped at a traffic light and arrested for\nmisdemeanor DUI  (Ex. 3, Ex. 6). He had a pipe on him containing marijuana residue,\nand a charge of possession of drug paraphernalia was added (Ex. 3, Tr. 70-73). In late\nMarch 2001, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced on the DUI to six months in jail, two\ndays to serve, one year probation, and fines and fees totaling $563 (Ex. 10). The drug\ncharge was dismissed (Ex. 3). Applicant claims he abstained from any marijuana use\nwhile on probation, as he was required to submit to court-mandated drug tests and\nattend an alcohol and drug program at a local treatment facility (Tr. 64, 74-75).\nApplicant resided at home with his mother while he was on probation.\nIn December 2002, he was awarded his bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science\nand engineering. Six months before, having finished his studies, he moved to the area\nwhere he had attended his first year of college and began working as a waiter (Ex. 1,\nEx. 2). Applicant did not use any marijuana there but smoked the drug on trips back\nhome (Tr. 57). In about August 2003, Applicant returned home to stay (Ex. 1, Ex. 2).\nApplicant resumed smoking marijuana on weekends with a friend from his first job as a\ncook/dishwasher (Tr. 56-58).\n\n5\nIn late September 2003, Applicant began working for his present employer. He\nwas informed of his employer\u2019s policy against the use of illegal drugs (Tr. 59). Within a\ncouple of weeks, he was told that he would need a security clearance. He understood\nthat \u201cmarijuana was not a proper thing to do\u201d and that it would affect his chances of\nobtaining a clearance, but continued to use marijuana on a weekly basis on weekends\n(Tr. 60).\nOn about December 4, 2003, Applicant completed a security clearance\napplication (SF 86) for a secret-level clearance. He responded \u201cYES\u201d to question 24,\n\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or\ndrugs?\u201d, and indicated that he had been fined for a May [sic] 1996 DWI. He also\nanswered \u201cYES\u201d to question 26, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for,\ncharged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or\n25?\u201d, and reported a January [sic] 2001 DWI. Applicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to the illegal\ndrug inquiries, including question 27 \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example,\nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine,\nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers,\netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d, and question 29, \u201cIn the\nlast 7 years, have you been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking,\nproduction, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,\nhallucinogen, or cannabis for your own intended profit or that of another?\u201d (Ex. 2).\nApplicant was granted his secret-level clearance (Tr. 51).\nOn August 2, 2004, Applicant submitted a SF 86, EPSQ version, for a top-secret\nclearance. He responded as he had on his December 2003 SF 86, listing the DWI\noffenses only in answer to questions 24 and 27, and denying any involvement with\nillegal drugs in answer to questions 27 and 29. He also denied in response to question\n28 that he had used a controlled substance while possessing a security clearance, even\nthough he had continued to smoke marijuana after being granted his secret clearance\n(Ex.1).\nOn September 1, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service\n(DSS) special agent. In a sworn statement, he discussed his listed DUI offenses in 1996\nand 2001, and related that on both occasions, he had also been charged with\npossession of drug paraphernalia since he had on him a pipe containing marijuana\nresidue. He indicated the 1996 charge had been nolle prossed and the 2001 charge had\nbeen dismissed. Applicant described his use of marijuana as \u201ctypically about once a\nweek\u201d in college. He indicated he had bought it \u201con maybe three occasions.\u201d He claimed\na last use of marijuana in 2001, before his college graduation, and denied any intent to\nuse marijuana or other illegal drug in the future. As for his failure to disclose his drug\ncharges or drug use on his December 2003 SF 86, Applicant explained that he was\nembarrassed and thought that if he listed them, his clearance would be in jeopardy (Ex.\n3).\n\n6\nApplicant was reinterviewed on September 20, 2004, about his failure to disclose\nhis drug use on his August 2004 SF 86 application for a top secret clearance. Applicant\nstated:\nI left out information relating to drug charges I was brought up on for my\nDWI arrests. I also left out that I had used drugs in the last seven years,\nspecifically in concert with the DWI. I left this information out since I had\ndone so on an earlier application for a secret clearance and as trying to\nstay consistent on all my applications (Ex. 4). \nAfter his interviews, Applicant continued to use marijuana on the weekends (Tr.\n61). In November 2005, Applicant smoked marijuana at his home with an old friend from\ncollege and an acquaintance of his friend\u2019s. Applicant \u201cfigured oh, what could it hurt\u201d\nsince he had not seen the friend in a long time (Tr. 47). The police, responding to a\ncomplaint of noise, smelled marijuana and observed a marijuana bowl (his friend\u2019s bowl,\nTr. 78) in plain view in Applicant\u2019s apartment. Applicant was arrested for misdemeanor\npossession of marijuana, first offense. In January 2006, he pleaded nolo contendere,\nand was sentenced to a $200 fee, court costs, and 25 hours of community service (Ex.\n5, Ex. 11, Ex. 12, Tr. 76-79). Applicant told his employer about his arrest \u201cthe next day\u201d\n(Tr. 79).\nOn July 7, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis November 2005 arrest for marijuana possession. Applicant indicated he had paid\nthe fine and planned to complete the community service by October. He related that the\npolice could smell marijuana in his apartment and saw a pot pipe (bowl) in plain view.\nHe admitted to past drug use, marijuana only, between 1995 and 2002 about four to five\ntimes on the weekend. He denied any current use of drugs or any future plans of drug\nuse (Ex. 5).\nApplicant continued to smoke marijuana weekly (Tr. 61). On March 14, 2007,\nApplicant was entering a local military base to test an integration system when his\nvehicle was selected for a random inspection. An authorized security contractor\ndiscovered a small clear plastic bag containing marijuana and a glass smoking pipe in\nthe center console. Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana\nand possession of drug paraphernalia on a federal installation (Ex. 13, Tr. 80). He was\nplanning to use marijuana after work (Tr. 80-81).\nOn March 21, 2007, Applicant was contacted by the investigator for further\ninformation. He indicated he had smoked marijuana in college from 1996 to 2002 on a\ndaily basis and periodically thereafter to March 2007. He admitted he had marijuana in\nhis apartment before his arrest in November 2005. He smoked it at that time because\nhe enjoyed it and to fall asleep. Applicant maintained he had stopped using marijuana in\nMarch 2007, and had contacted the employee assistance program (EAP) at work to\nhelp him abstain (Ex. 5). There is no indication that Applicant told the investigator of his\nrecent drug-related arrest on the military installation.  \n\n7\nOn March 29, 2007, Applicant began counseling with a licensed marital and\nfamily therapist (LMFT) to establish sustained recovery from marijuana abuse. He\ncontinued in his counseling through his employer\u2019s EAP initially once a week and then\nonce every two weeks (Ex. 6, Ex. A, Tr. 65). In response to interrogatories from DOHA,\nApplicant affirmed in July 2007 that he had not used any marijuana since March 2007.\nHe indicated he was still seeing his EAP-provided drug counselor to assist him in\nremaining free of illegal drugs. He expressed a willingness and plan to take drug tests to\nprove his abstinence (Ex. 5). In response to separate interrogatories, Applicant averred\nthat he last used marijuana on March 14, 2007 when he smoked the drug in a bowl.\nApplicant disclosed his detention in March 2007 on drug charges, but indicated he was\nreceiving counseling every two weeks. Asked again to explain why he had not listed his\ndrug use on his December 2003 and August 2004 security clearance applications,\nApplicant chose instead to reiterate that he had ceased using marijuana:\nMy use of marijuana has been sporadic. At time in my past I had smoked\nit, and at some time I did not. I can obviously see now that I cannot use\nmarijuana and live my life the way I should. I swear that I have grown up\nand I no longer have marijuana as any part of my life. I will have drug\ntesting done to show that I have stopped (Ex. 6).\nOn August 13, 2007, Applicant was notified that he was prohibited for one year,\nretroactive from his detention date, from entering the military installation where he had\nbeen caught with marijuana (Ex. 13, Tr. 81). In September 2007, Applicant went to court\nfor the March 2007 drug charges. He was informed that he was going to be put into a\nsix month to year-long program and then the charges would be expunged on its\ncompletion (Tr. 82-84). As of March 2008, Applicant had heard nothing further (Tr. 83).\nApplicant smoked marijuana at least once in December 2007. He was at a party\nwith friends (\u201cI really didn\u2019t see how I was going to keep my clearance, after all the stuff\nthat I\u2019ve been through, and I was weak for a night.\u201d Tr. 62). In March 2008, Applicant\nwas told by his employer that if he managed to keep his clearance, steps would be\ntaken to ensure his abstinence from illegal drugs, such as drug testing (Tr. 63).\nApplicant remains friendly with those with whom he used marijuana since 2005,\nalthough he is willing to stop hanging out with these friends if necessary to keep his job\n(Tr. 84, 98). In about late January 2008, Applicant told a close friend with whom he used\nmarijuana in December 2007 that he was having a hearing on his clearance and that he\n\u201cshould probably be smart and just not smoke anymore, smoke pot anymore.\u201d (Tr. 98).\nApplicant\u2019s counselor has told him that he could be addicted to marijuana (Tr. 85), and\nthat he should abstain completely (Tr. 99). On a couple of occasions since December\n2007, the last time in late February 2008, Applicant has been present when others\nbrought out marijuana (\u201cIt was just like my [sic], like after a few drinks at the bar, we\u2019ll go\nback to my buddy\u2019s place and just hang out, just a little bit after, and then I usually walk\nhome from there.\u201d ) (Tr. 100). Knowing his self control is \u201cvery low,\u201d Applicant left almost\nimmediately (Tr. 101).\n\n8\nIn March 2008, Applicant moved in with his girlfriend to change his environment.\nThey have been together for eight months (Tr. 46). In the past, Applicant did not feel\nthat his marijuana use was causing enough of a problem for him to stop. He now\nunderstands that his marijuana use has repercussions for his job and future (Tr. 45-47).\nHis therapist indicates he has been compliant with his treatment and he is acquiring the\nnecessary skills to maintain long term abstinence (Ex. A). \nApplicant has been eager to take on assignments at work and has responded to\nthe challenge of increasing responsibilities. He is considered a key member of his\nsoftware development team (Ex. C). The company\u2019s facility security officer has found\nhim to be conscientious in handling classified information. She is aware Applicant has\nbeen attending counseling on a regular basis and believes he has learned a valuable\nlesson form his past actions (Ex. B).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n9\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern related to the guideline for drug involvement is set out in\nAG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d  After trying marijuana at a New Year\u2019s Eve\nparty in 1993, Applicant smoked marijuana with friends every couple of months. He\nrefrained from drug use during his freshman year of college out of state, but after\ntransferring to his home state\u2019s university, he abused marijuana with regularity, at times\ndaily. He also purchased the drug for his own consumption every couple of weeks.\nArrests on drug-related charges in August 1996 and February 2001 had little impact on\nchanging his attitude toward illegal drugs. Except for occasional weekends spent back\nhome, he abstained from marijuana use from June 2002 to August 2003 when living out\nof state. Once he returned in August 2003, he resumed his involvement with marijuana\non the weekends. He continued this abuse while in his current job, knowing it was\nagainst his employer\u2019s policy, and after he had obtained a secret clearance and applied\nfor an upgrade to top secret. He was arrested in his apartment for marijuana possession\nin November 2005 and sentenced to a fine and community service. Yet, he continued to\nsmoke the drug weekly until March 2007, when he was caught entering a military\ninstallation with marijuana and a small pipe in the console of his vehicle. Despite\nongoing counseling since late March 2007, Applicant again smoked marijuana on at\nleast one occasion in December 2007. AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d), \u00b6 25(c) (\u201cillegal\ndrug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d), and \u00b6 25(g) (\u201cany illegal drug use\nafter being granted a security clearance\u201d), are clearly applicable.\nNone of the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 26 apply. Marijuana played a\nlarge part in Applicant\u2019s life until March 2007 when he was caught entering a federal\ninstallation with marijuana in his vehicle. AG \u00b6 26(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long\n\n10\nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment\u201d) clearly does not apply. Despite ongoing counseling with an LMFT since\nlate March 2007 to assist him in achieving sustained abstinence, he continues to\nassociate with those friends with whom he used marijuana in the past. Applicant waited\nuntil January 2008 to inform his close friend with whom he shared marijuana that he no\nlonger intends to use marijuana. As recently as February 2008, others pulled out\nmarijuana in his presence at this friend\u2019s house. While Applicant left on that occasion,\nhe had smoked marijuana in a similar situation only a couple of months before.\nApplicant is now willing if required to dissociate himself from drug-using associates (see\nAG \u00b6 26(b)(1)), but the fact that he has not yet done so raises considerable concerns\nabout his commitment to reform. Under AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), a demonstrated intent not to\nabuse drugs in the future can be shown by \u201cchanging or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used.\u201d Within the past month, Applicant moved in with his girlfriend,\nbut it is too soon to conclude that he will be able to avoid those friends and\nenvironments associated with marijuana use. It has been only three months since his\nlast use of marijuana, which is far short of that appropriate to demonstrate intent not to\nabuse drugs in the future under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), given his years of frequent if not regular\ndrug abuse.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhen Applicant applied for a secret-level clearance in December 2003, he did\nnot disclose in response to question 24 (any alcohol or drug charges or convictions) that\nhe had been arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia (convicted of\nthe latter) in 1996, and that he had been arrested for possession of drug paraphernalia\nin February 2001. He did not disclose the 2001 drug paraphernalia charge in response\nto question 26 (any other arrests, charges, or convictions within the last seven years).\nApplicant also responded \u201cNO\u201d to question 27 concerning any illegal drug use in the last\nseven years, and to question 29 regarding any illegal drug purchases in the last seven\nyears. In August 2004, Applicant filled out an application for a top secret clearance. He\nprovided the same answers to questions 24, 26, 27, and 29. Accepting the Applicant did\nnot use marijuana while he was on probation for the February 2001 DUI, he had used\nmarijuana regularly in college from August 1995 to May 2001, sporadically from June\n2002 to August 2003, and on weekends after starting his defense contractor\nemployment. His drug-related arrests, abuse of marijuana, and purchases of marijuana\n\n11\nwere required to be reported on the December 2003 and August 2004 security\nclearance applications.\nWhile Applicant does not deny that he falsified his responses to question 27\nconcerning drug use, he explained that he thought he did not have to list the drug\ncharges because he had been told they would be expunged (i.e., no record of them, Tr.\n43-44, 91), and that he thought question 29 applied to drug traffickers and he failed to\nread it as closely as he should have (Tr. 89-90). He also attributed his inaccurate\nresponses to denial over his marijuana problem (\u201cI think as part of the denial that goes\non in my head, I just wanted to get those questions over with as quickly as possible and\nmay have skimmed over them and not looked at them as closely as I should have.\u201d Tr.\n90). There is no evidence any of the drug charges had been expunged. If Applicant in\ngood faith had equated nolle prossed with expungement, he likely would have listed his\nconviction of a drug paraphernalia charge in 1996. His clearance applications fail to\ndisclose any involvement with illegal drugs. It is telling that in a September 2004 written\nstatement, Applicant stated, \u201cMy Security Clearance Application does not reflect the\ndrug charges, nor does it reflect my marijuana use. I was embarrassed by these events\nand thought that if I listed them my security clearance would be in jeopardy.\u201d (See Ex.\n3). AG \u00b6 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d) applies because of the SF 86 falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a\nthrough 2.f.\nFurthermore, the evidence shows that Applicant falsified a September 1, 2004\nsworn statement, and material facts during a July 7, 2006 interview beyond that alleged\nin the recent amendments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g, 2.h, and 2.i). In his September 1, 2004-sworn\nstatement, Applicant admitted he had been charged with possession of drug\nparaphernalia in addition to DUI in both 1996 and 2001, but he claimed the 1996 charge\nhad been nolle prossed. He did not reveal that he had also been charged with illegal\ndrug possession, which was the charge that had been nolle prossed, or that he had\nbeen convicted of the drug paraphernalia charge in 1996 (see SOR \u00b6 2.g). Not alleged\nby the government but reluctantly acknowledged by Applicant at his hearing (Tr. 93-94),\nhe also falsely asserted that his last use of marijuana was in 2001 before his college\ngraduation. When reinterviewed on September 20, 2004 (Ex. 4), Applicant had an\nopportunity to correct the record and admit that his marijuana abuse was ongoing.\nInstead, he indicated, \u201cI also left out that I had used drugs in the last seven years,\nspecifically in concert with the DWI . . . since I had done so on an earlier application for\na secret clearance, and was trying to stay consistent on all my applications. His\ncomment is misleading in that a reader could infer that his abuse occurred only in\nconcert with his drunk driving offenses. AG \u00b6 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative\u201d)\napplies.\n\nThe following exchange concerning his September 1, 2004, misrepresentations is illustrative:\n2\nQ\n But you, in that statement, you told him that your drug use had ceased when you left\ncollege in 2001, correct?\nA \nAt that time, I had stopped, yes, and I started again later on. It\u2019s, I mean it all varies,\nI\u2019m not, you know, at that time, when I had that interview with [the DSS Agent], I had\nstopped.\nQ\nOkay, but you had, you might not be, so let me clarify then. Your testimony is that\nyou were not using in September of 2004 when you were interviewed by [the DSS\nAgent], correct?\nA\nW hen I talked to him at that point, yes.\nQ\nBut you had used between 2001 and September of 2004, correct?\nA\nYes, ma\u2019am.\nQ\nSo when you told him that you had stopped using in 2001, that was false, right?\nA\nYes.\n(Tr. 93-94).\n12\nHe was not completely candid with a government investigator on July 7, 2006, as\nwell. When asked about his November 2005 arrest for possession of marijuana,\nApplicant claimed that his drug use consisted of marijuana between 1995 and 2002 four\nto five times on the weekends while a college student, and he falsely denied any current\nuse. There is conflicting evidence as to whether Applicant used marijuana on a daily\nbasis from 1996 to 2002 (see n.1), but he unquestionably minimized the extent of his\nmarijuana involvement in college and, moreover, concealed his subsequent abuse,\nincluding on the occasion of his arrest in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.i). AG \u00b6 16(b) also\napplies to his false statements in July 2006. Applicant\u2019s ongoing association with known\nillegal drug users implicates AG \u00b6 16(g) (\u201cassociation with persons involved in criminal\nactivity\u201d), although it was not alleged as a separate concern under Guideline E.\nApplicant does not satisfy any of the relevant mitigating conditions under\nGuideline E. AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the\nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts\u201d) is\ninapplicable to his record of piecemeal disclosure. There is no evidence that he relied\non the advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel concerning the security\nclearance process required by AG \u00b6 17(b). His record of multiple misrepresentation is\nnot only serious, but also too recent to consider AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe offense was so minor,\nor so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). As recently as March 21,\n2007, Applicant discussed with a government investigator his marijuana use and his\narrest in November 2005. Although he \u201cvolunteered \u201c during that interview that he used\na lot of marijuana in college and up to March 2007, the evidence does not show that he\ntold the investigator of his arrest the previous week on the military installation.\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment of the falsity of some of his previous statements to the\ngovernment  provides a limited degree of encouragement about his reformation.\n2\n\nIn the SOR as amended, the government alleged that Applicant was arrested for DUI on August 5, 1996, in\n3\naddition to the drug charges in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The DUI is relevant under Guideline H to the extent it shows\nApplicant used marijuana at times in combination with alcohol. However, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d because his\ndrug conduct at issue is addressed in \u00b6 1.c and as such \u00b6 1.g is duplicative. \n13\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Applicant has raised considerable doubts about his\ncontinued suitability for classified access, notwithstanding his record of properly\nhandling classified information at work. He was granted his secret clearance when the\ngovernment was unaware of the extent of his true drug involvement. He also continued\nto smoke marijuana while holding that clearance, to as recently as December 2007.\nApplicant also showed disregard for his fiduciary obligation of candor with the\ngovernment. Under the totality of the facts and circumstances presented, I conclude it is\nnot clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for him. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant3\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nCriminal conduct concerns raised by his felony drug conviction are mitigated by\nthe passage of time and compliance with sentencing terms. Personal conduct concerns\npersist because he denied any felony convictions when he applied for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (e-QIP)\non October 26, 2006. On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline J and Guideline E as the bases for its decision to deny his request for a\nsecurity clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nJune 26, 2008\n\n2\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn September 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On February 27, 2008, the government submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) consisting of 11 exhibits (Items 1-11). DOHA forwarded a\ncopy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt.\nApplicant did not respond by the April 3, 2008, due date, and on May 30, 2008, the case\nwas assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based on a review of the\ngovernment\u2019s FORM, including Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (Item 4), eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDOHA alleged in part under Guideline J that Applicant was disqualified from\nhaving a security clearance granted or renewed under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 because he had\nbeen incarcerated from March 15, 1990, to August 1, 1991, and then on work release\nuntil December 2. 1991, following his conviction of felony possession of cocaine with\nintent to distribute (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In the FORM, the government moved to withdraw SOR\n\u00b6 1.b due to the repeal of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986. On January 28, 2008, the President signed\ninto law Public Law 110-181, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year\n2008, Section 1072 which repealed 10 U.S.C. Section 986, formerly known as the Smith\nAmendment. Under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435c, after January 1, 2008, an employee of a\ncontractor of a federal agency who has been convicted in any court of the United States\nof a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and incarcerated\nunder that sentence for not less than one year, may not be granted or renewed a\nsecurity clearance, absent an express waiver, if that clearance provides for access to\nspecial access programs, restricted data, or sensitive compartmented information.\nSince Applicant seeks a collateral clearance, there is good cause to grant the\namendment. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.b is considered withdrawn. Findings and conclusions\nstill warrant and will be made as to SOR \u00b6 1.a concerning Applicant\u2019s arrest, conviction,\nand sentence on the drug charge, and as to SOR \u00b6 2.a concerning his alleged failure to\nlist that offense on his SF 86.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA submits under Guideline J, criminal conduct, as amended, that Applicant\nwas sentenced to 20 years in prison, 14 years suspended, for a June 1989 charge of\nfelony possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and that he was incarcerated from\nMarch 15, 1990, to August 1, 1991, was on work release to December 2, 1991, and\nremains on probation to 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline E, personal conduct,\nApplicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified an Electronic Questionnaire for\n\nThe security clearance application admitted as Item 5 is a Standard Form 86-Questionnaire for Sensitive\n1\nPositions bearing a typewritten entry on page 7 of \u201cSF-86 DATED 10/25/06 ********** END OF EQSP.\u201d\nHowever, the attached signature page bearing Applicant\u2019s handwritten signature and date of \u201c10-26-06\" is a\nsignature form for the electronic version (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP)) of\nthe SF 86.\nThe Answer submitted as Item 4 consists of three pages. The first two pages are a copy of the original SOR\n2\ncontaining Applicant\u2019s responses to the Guideline J concerns only, and no response to the Guideline E\nconcern. On November 14, 2007, Applicant\u2019s employer of record faxed a copy of the second page of\nApplicant\u2019s SOR also bearing a notarization on September 5, 2007, but containing his responses to the\nGuideline E concern. DOHA included it as page 3 of Applicant\u2019s Answer. It is not clear whether Applicant\nanswered the Guideline E concern in September or in November 2007.\nApplicant told a government investigator on February 20, 2007, that he was convicted of a reduced charge\n3\nof possession of cocaine (Item 6). The FBI also reports, apparently on information from correctional\nauthorities, that Applicant was sentenced to six years for possession of cocaine (Item 7). Yet, the circuit court\nsentencing record shows he was convicted of cocaine possession with intent to distribute (Item 9). Local police\nreport a charge of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (Item 8).\nThe dates of his incarceration are taken from the activity dates reflected on the prisoner location record (Item\n4\n10). The release date in November 1991 conforms to the date he indicates he was paroled (Item 6).\n3\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) executed on October 26, 2006,  in that he responded\n1\nnegatively to whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony offense\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a). In his Answer, Applicant denied the alleged falsification without\nexplanation but admitted the felony drug charge, conviction, and sentence.  After\n2\nconsidering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old painter who has worked for his present employer, a\ndefense contractor, since April 1992 (Item 5). The record available for review does not\nreflect that he holds a security clearance.\nIn about 1986, Applicant began to use cocaine. He continued his involvement\nwith the drug by himself or at parties approximately three times weekly until June 1989\n(Item 6). Sometime in or before June 1989, Applicant began to sell cocaine. He was\narrested at his home in June 1989 and charged with possession of cocaine with intent\nto distribute, a felony. He was jailed for four days and then released on $50,000 bail\n(Item 6). In early February 1990, he pleaded guilty to the felony charge.  He was\n3\nsentenced to 20 years in the state penitentiary, 14 years of the prison term suspended\nto be spent on probation with conditions. The conditions were that he be of good\nbehavior, not violate the law, comply with the terms of his parole and probation,\nincluding complete any drug/alcohol program deemed appropriate by his probation\nofficer, and pay court costs within two years of his release from confinement. He was\nalso ordered to pay a $5,000 fine at a rate and an amount set by his probation officer\nprior to the end of his suspension (Items 6, 7, 8, 9).\nApplicant was incarcerated from about mid-March 1990, to mid-November 1991.4\nWhile in custody, he voluntarily attended a drug treatment program consisting of twice\nweekly group sessions (Item 6). He was on work release for the last five months, from\n\n4\nJune to November 1991 and then paroled. In mid-April 1993, he was discharged from\nparole and placed on probation for the remainder of his sentence (Items 6, 10). As of\nFebruary 2007, Applicant had paid his fines in full and was on unsupervised probation.\nHe is scheduled to be released from probation in 2010 (Item 6).\nOn or about October 25, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) that was entered into the e-QIP system\nelectronically. On October 26, 2006, he certified that his statements on the e-QIP were\n\u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and [were] made in\ngood faith.\u201d (Item 5). A printed form of the completed e-QIP was not included in the file\nfor review.\nA Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) was prepared and then printed\nout on November 7, 2006. \u201cNO\u201d responses were entered as to all the police record\ninquiries including \u201c23A - FELONY?\u201d (Item 5). The evidence is inconclusive as to who\nentered the data entries that appear on the SF 86, but the document on its face\nindicates it is the property of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Item 5 in\nthe FORM includes the SF 86 with Applicant\u2019s signature forms from the e-QIP attached.\nThere is no information of record as to how the signature forms for the e-QIP came to\nbe attached to the SF 86, which does not contain a signature block.\nA check of Applicant\u2019s record with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nrevealed on November 8, 2006, that Applicant had been sentenced to six years in\nprison in 1990 for \u201cposs cocaine\u201d (Item 7). On February 20, 2007, Applicant was\ninterviewed by an investigator for the Department of Defense about his criminal\nconduct. Applicant averred he had been arrested in June 1989 for possession of\ncocaine with intent to distribute, but convicted of a reduced charge of possession of\ncocaine. He acknowledged his 20-year-prison sentence, 14 years suspended, although\nhe only served 21 months. He denied any violations of his probation, currently\nunsupervised, from which he will be released in 2010. Applicant denied any use of\ncocaine since that arrest or any future intent to use drugs (Item 6). There is no\nindication that the investigator inquired about any omission of the charge from his e-\nQIP.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n5\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d Applicant was engaged in the sales of cocaine in at least June 1989 if\nnot before. He told a government investigator in February 2007 that he believed\nsomeone had alerted police that he was selling cocaine and that the police had him\nunder surveillance before his arrest in June 1989 (Item 6). In February 1990, Applicant\nwas convicted of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, a felony offense under\nstate law. Sentenced to serve six years in the state penitentiary, he was paroled in\n\n6\nabout November 1991 after 20 months of incarceration. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\n31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged\u201d)\napply because of his felonious criminal conduct. AG \u00b6 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on\nparole or probation\u201d) also is implicated because he is on probation, albeit now\nunsupervised, until 2010.\nInvolvement in illegal drug distribution or sales reflects a serious disrespect for\nthe law. Applicant submits in mitigation that he stopped his illegal drug involvement after\nhis arrest on the felony drug charge. Certainly while he was incarcerated from March\n1990 to November 1991, he was not in a position to access illegal drugs for sale or\npersonal consumption, and there is no evidence of any involvement with illegal drugs\nsince he was paroled. AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment\u201d) applies in mitigation of his drug sales. The absence of any recurrence of\ndrug-related criminal conduct for some 19 years is also a relevant factor in assessing\nwhether Applicant has demonstrated sufficient reform to warrant favorable consideration\nof AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement\u201d). So too is his current probationary status, which although not a per se bar\nto a clearance, raises somewhat his burden of showing successful rehabilitation. The\nstate where he committed the criminal conduct has not yet seen fit to release him. Yet,\nthe fact that his probation apparently has been unsupervised since at least 2007 if not\nbefore indicates that he has been compliant with its conditions. He asserts, also with no\nevidence to the contrary, that he has paid all his fines for his offense. What little can be\ngarnered from the limited information about his work record available for review is that\nhe has been employed by the same company since April 1992, which shows a stable\nwork record. Applicant also took steps to ensure that his drug activity would not recur by\nvoluntarily obtaining counseling while he was in prison. Correctional officials did not\nconsider him at significant risk to re-offend since they granted parole after he served 20\nmonths of the six-year sentence. He is sufficiently rehabilitated of his drug-related\ncriminal conduct to find for him as to SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\nDepartment Counsel asserted in the FORM that Applicant in his Answer  \u201cis apparently admitted that he did\n5\nnot provide the requested information, but denying that he falsified his [e-QIP].\u201d  I am not persuaded that\nApplicant was admitting to other than that he had been charged and convicted of a felony.\n7\nDOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his e-QIP by responding negatively\nto inquiry concerning whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense. Under AG \u00b6 16(a), personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d Since Applicant denied any intentional falsification, albeit with no\nexplanation,  the government has the burden to prove that he knowingly and willfully\n5\nconcealed his felony conviction when he applied for his security clearance.\nLikely due to the e-QIP being transmitted electronically, the file available for\nreview does not contain the e-QIP on which Applicant allegedly answered \u201cNo\u201d to 23a,\n\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? (Include those\nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice).\u201d The government submitted a SF 86 dated\nNovember 7, 2006 (Item 5), containing the same lines of inquiry but in truncated form\n(e.g., \u201c23A-FELONY?\u201d) with attached signature forms from the e-QIP dated October 26,\n2006. The government offered no evidence to explain  the process of completing the SF\n86, such as who entered the data onto the SF 86 or how Applicant\u2019s signature forms for\nthe e-QIP completed days earlier, came to be appended to a SF 86 that on its face is\nthe property of OPM.\nHowever, Applicant was given a copy of the SF 86 with the FORM. His failure to\nraise any inaccuracies about the SF 86 supports a logical inference that he responded\n\u201cNo\u201d to the relevant police record inquiries when he completed the electronically\nsubmitted e-QIP. He has not asserted that he reported his felony conviction on his e-\nQIP. While a negative response to question 23a does not necessarily prove the willful\nintent required under AG \u00b6 16(a), Applicant offered no explanation for his failure to\ndisclose his felony conviction. Especially given his prison sentence and current\nprobationary status, the evidence supports a reasonable finding of intentional\nfalsification.\nAbout four months after he completed his e-QIP, Applicant was interviewed\nabout his criminal conduct by a government investigator. There is no indication that\nApplicant was reluctant to discuss his conviction. He admitted someone had alerted\npolice to the fact that he was selling drugs and that he had been using cocaine himself\nup to three times per week. While this effort at rectification is reasonably prompt, AG \u00b6\n17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted\u201d), also requires that it be before\nconfrontation. The purpose of the subject interview was to discuss Applicant\u2019s criminal\nconduct, so the government knew of his conviction before the interview. The likely\n\n8\nsource of the government\u2019s information was the FBI record of November 8, 2006 (Item\n7), showing that Applicant had been sentenced to six years in prison in 1990. It is not\nclear whether Applicant volunteered the information up-front. Under the circumstances, I\nam unable to fully apply AG \u00b6 17(a). Moreover, Applicant\u2019s recent denial of any\nintentional falsification casts doubt about whether his representations can be relied on.\nNone of the other mitigating conditions are pertinent.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s involvement with cocaine\nincluded frequent use, purchase, and some sales of the drug to others. While felonious\ncriminal conduct reflected extremely poor judgment on his part, it occurred some 19\nyears ago. He showed some rehabilitation even during his incarceration in that he\nvolunteered for drug counseling, and he was granted work release little more than a\nyear into his six-year sentence. He was paroled early, and within five months of his\nrelease, he started with his present employer in April 1992. There is no indication that\nApplicant has been other than law-abiding, but concerns persist about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness, because of his failure to disclose his felony conviction\nwhen he applied for his security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nWithdrawn\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2006 e-QIP by denying he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts within the seven years preceding his clearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.a), or that he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.b). DOHA also alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant committed a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by falsifying his response to the debt inquiries on his e-QIP (SOR \u00b6 3.a). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations with explanations. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old production manager who has worked for his current employer, a small defense contractor, since March 2005. He seeks a secret-level security clearance for overseas duties involving power systems for defense applications. He held an interim clearance, which was withdrawn on issuance of the SOR. Applicant married his first wife in September 1981. During their four-year marriage, they had three children who are now young adults and live on their own.

On July 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F,\nGuideline E, and Guideline J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 9, 2007. He answered the\nSOR in writing on September 21, 2007, and requested a decision based on the record\nwithout a hearing. On October 30, 2007, Applicant requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 19,\n2007. On November 21, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for December 12, 2007.\nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing on December 12, 2007, as scheduled. Three\nGovernment exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and six Applicant exhibits (A-F) were received into\nevidence without objection and Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript\n(Tr.) received by DOHA on December 21, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\nthe record open until January 2, 2008, to submit additional documents. Applicant\nforwarded by facsimile proposed exhibit G on December 14, 2007, exhibits H-K on\nDecember 18, 2007, and exhibit L on December 20, 2007. In corresponding email\nmessages, Applicant explained his efforts to contact his creditors. A record of his email\ncorrespondence with DOHA was marked as exhibit M. On January 3, 2008, I gave the\nGovernment until January 11, 2008, to respond. Department Counsel indicated on\nJanuary 11, 2008, that the Government had no objections, and the exhibits were\nreceived in evidence. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of May 14,\n2007, Applicant owed delinquent debts of $6,543 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $4,128 (SOR \u00b6 1.b),\n$2,807 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $3,774.75 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $161 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified his October 2006\ne-QIP by denying he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts within the seven\nyears preceding his clearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.a), or that he was currently over 90\ndays delinquent on any debts (SOR \u00b6 2.b). DOHA also alleged under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct, that Applicant committed a felony violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by\nfalsifying his response to the debt inquiries on his e-QIP (SOR \u00b6 3.a). In his Answer to\nthe SOR, Applicant denied the allegations with explanations. After consideration of the\nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old production manager who has worked for his current\nemployer, a small defense contractor, since March 2005. He seeks a secret-level\nsecurity clearance for overseas duties involving power systems for defense\napplications.  He held an interim clearance, which was withdrawn on issuance of the\nSOR.\nApplicant married his first wife in September 1981. During their four-year\nmarriage, they had three children who are now young adults and live on their own.  In\nNovember 1992, Applicant married his current spouse. They have a 17-year-old son\nwho lives with them.\nApplicant served in the United States Air Force from April 1982 to March 1988.\nHe held a secret clearance while he was in the military. In August 1988, he began\nworking as a test engineer and technician in the semiconductor industry with company\nX. His financial obligations, including his mortgage, were paid on time. He and his\nspouse took out automobile loans for $17,364 in November 1995, and for $32,898 in\nMarch 1997. Both were paid off according to terms. (Ex. 3)\n\n3\nIn June 1997, he continued in the same line of work but with a new employer. In\nSeptember 1999, Applicant and his spouse bought a boat for waterskiing, taking out a\nloan of $23,367 to be repaid at $265 monthly for 180 months. As of July 2001, the loan\nwas rated as current. (Ex. 3, Tr. 97)\nIn August 2000, Applicant returned to work for company X. (Ex. 1) In March\n2001, he and his spouse took out a loan for $75,000 to remodel their home. (Ex. 3, Tr.\n95) By 2002 they had problems meeting some of their financial obligations. An individual\nrevolving charge account opened by Applicant in June 2002 was closed in February\n2003 with a balance owed of $4,128 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A MasterCard account Applicant had\nopened in October 2002 was $5,392 past due as of May 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). As of\nNovember 2002, Applicant had a past due balance of $178 on another credit card (not\nalleged). The debt was settled in March 2005 for less than the $445.29 owed at the\ntime. In December 2002, a VISA card account on which Applicant was an authorized\nuser was charged off in the amount of $6,543 and placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a).\nApplicant had his own MasterCard account with the same lender, which was settled for\nless than the full $5,237 balance in July 2003 (not alleged). As of March 2003, he and\nhis spouse were 60 days past due ($2,552 in arrears) in their mortgage payment. In\nMay 2003, Applicant\u2019s account with a wholesale retail club, opened in December 1998,\nwas charged off in the amount of $2,807 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In December 2003, a $161\nmedical debt was referred for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Ex. 2, Ex. 3)\nApplicant and his spouse sought the services of a debt resolution firm in 2002.\nWhile they were able to take care of only a few of their debts (\u201cwe weren\u2019t able to keep\nup with the program at that point, just because of other reasons, other things that\nhappened and that kind of came along.\u201d Tr. 65), the phone calls from creditors stopped\n(Tr. 36).\nIn 2004, Applicant and his spouse purchased a week in a timeshare, about 2 1/2\nhours from their home at the time. Applicant, who traveled there for outdoor activities,\nstayed in a unit for $35 per night when one was available. It was less expensive than a\nhotel in the area. (Tr. 99) \nIn Fall 2004, Applicant\u2019s spouse, who worked for the same company as\nApplicant, left her job and moved to their present locale.  (Tr. 67, 105) Applicant worked\na shift that allowed him to spend the weekends with his wife and son. (Tr. 67) He was\nearning between $50,000 and $55,000 annually depending on overtime hours. In\nDecember 2004, Applicant got a part-time job as a lift attendant at an alpine ski resort at\n$7.50 per hour. They sold their home in their previous locale that same month, satisfied\ntheir mortgage, and paid off the loan taken out to remodel the premises. In January\n2005, Applicant was laid off from his job in the semiconductor industry. His spouse was\nstill unemployed. Applicant worked full-time as a lift attendant to support the family until\nlate March 2005. (Tr. 65-69)\nIn late March 2005, Applicant began working as a shop manager for his present\nemployer, a small power systems company of 15 employees. His spouse began\n\nApplicant testified that the company had reduced in size from fifteen to nine employees. (Tr. 102)\n1\n4\nworking there as well in June 2005, as an administrative assistant at about $11 an hour.\n(Tr. 69, 106) \nIn January 2006, a retailer placed Applicant\u2019s delinquent account with a balance\nof $4,128 for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In April 2006, Applicant and his spouse leased a\nfour-wheel-drive vehicle for her at a cost of $585 per month for 36 months. \nOn October 13, 2006, Applicant submitted his e-QIP seeking a secret-level\nclearance. Due to a technical problem, Applicant had to re-sign the document on\nOctober 19, 2006. (Tr. 62-63) Applicant responded negatively to financial delinquency\ninquiries: 28 a. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d and 28 b. \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d. (Ex. 1)\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 8, 2006, revealed a history of late\npayments on some accounts brought current, such as his boat loan, which had a\nbalance of $17,661. Several accounts were listed as charged off and/or placed for\ncollection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a as authorized user, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d and 1.e). (Ex. 3)\nIn about December 2006, Applicant listed the timeshare for sale. As of December\n2007, it was still on the market. (Tr. 99-100, Ex. J) Applicant and his spouse continued\nto pay $100 per month for the timeshare. (Ex. J)\nOn January 11, 2007, Applicant was interviewed for his security clearance. He\nexpressed a willingness to resolve his indebtedness. (Ex. 2) In January 2007, Applicant\nand his spouse looked into buying a home. They were told they would qualify for a loan\nbut at a higher interest rate due their credit problems. The decided not to pursue home\nownership at that time due to their employer\u2019s economic outlook.  (Tr. 86) Applicant\n1\nobtained his own credit report on January 18, 2007, to confirm his debt (Tr. 37). He and\nhis spouse decided to address their outstanding accounts one at a time. (Tr. 36-37) His\nspouse continued to handle the family\u2019s finances as she had since their marriage, but\nApplicant took a more active role. (Tr. 85)\nOn April 20, 2007, the creditor owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d agreed to settle the\n$5,392.50 balance for $3,774.72. The debt was to be repaid at $314.56 per month from\nMay 2007 through April 2008 in return for waiving late fees and finance charges. (Ex. 2)\nAfter an initial payment of $331 in May, he made payments of $350 in June, $400 each\nin July, August, and September, and $320 in October, reducing the balance  to about\n$1,573.72. (Ex. D, Ex. I, Ex. L) On or before June 1, 2007, Applicant paid the $161.10\nmedical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Ex. E)\nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant indicated on May 14, 2007,\nthat he had reached a settlement agreement with the creditor owed the debt in SOR \u00b6\n1.d. Once that debt had been satisfied, he would deal with his other consumer credit\ndebts in succession (in order \u00b61.c, 1.b, and 1.a). He maintained he had not known of\n\n5\nthe medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e) before he saw his credit report, and promised\nto take care of that debt within 30 days. As for his failure to disclose his debts on his e-\nQIP, Applicant explained, \u201cI thought that these debts had been released because the\ncompanies had them listed as \u2018charge offs\u2019 on my credit report.\u201d Applicant also\nfurnished a personal financial statement indicating that he and his spouse had\n$1,398.44 remaining each month after payment of expenses and debts, including $585\nfor his spouse\u2019s car, $266 for their boat, $314.56 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, $100 for the\ntimeshare, and $15 on his spouse\u2019s credit card. He estimated he owed $17,400 for the\nboat, $433 on her credit card, $3,774.75 on the delinquent debt in \u00b6 1.d, and $3,552.30\nfor the timeshare. (Ex. 2)\nIn June 2007, Applicant and his family vacationed in California. He believes they\nfinanced the trip with savings, although he isn\u2019t sure. (Tr. 89)\nAfter Applicant received the SOR, he consulted with an attorney who advised him\nto contact his creditors and attempt to arrange repayment terms. (Tr. 37) In or before\nAugust 2007, Applicant contacted the assignee collecting the $4,128 retail charge\ndelinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The collection agency agreed to accept in settlement\n$2,477.14, payable in three installments ($400, which was paid by Applicant on August\n24, 2007, $301.26 which was paid by him on October 2, 2007, followed by a balloon\npayment of $1,775.88 due October 31, 2007). (Ex. B, Ex. L) Applicant informed the\ncollection agency that he could not afford the balloon payment. (Tr. 49) On November\n28, 2007, he paid an additional $107.26. As of December 2007, he had not called the\ncreditor to negotiate additional payments. (Tr. 50-51) \nApplicant contacted the creditors reportedly owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and\n1.c. On or before September 17, 2007, the creditor removed the reported delinquency\non the account in \u00b6 1.a from Applicant\u2019s credit record. (Ex. A) Applicant understood from\ntalking to the creditor that the reported balance had been paid and was no longer his\nresponsibility. (Tr. 45-46) Applicant was informed by the presumed creditor of the debt\nin SOR \u00b6 1.c that his account had been sold in 2004. Applicant was unsuccessful in\nsetting up a payment plan with the named assignee as the company had no record of\nthe debt. (Ex. C, Tr. 30)\nAs of December 2007, Applicant\u2019s hourly rate was $17.71, and his spouse\u2019s was\n$12.08. (Ex. K) Based on average overtime earnings, Applicant estimated a net monthly\nhousehold remainder of $874.18, after payment of expenses and debts (including his\npayments on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d). (Ex. J) Applicant and his spouse each have one low\nlimit credit card account for emergencies. Applicant\u2019s credit card balance was about\n$300. (Tr. 73-74) Applicant owes about $16,500 on his boat loan. (Tr. 88) He listed the\nboat for sale in Fall 2007. (Tr. 100) After paying $500 in legal expenses for assistance in\ndrafting his Answer, and $1,650 in dental expenses for their son, Applicant and his\nspouse have about $500 in savings. (Tr. 83-84)\nAt his hearing, Applicant attributed his failure to report any delinquent debts on\nhis e-QIP to his belief that his old debts were more than seven years in the past. (Tr. 37)\n\n6\nHe cited his ability to lease vehicles and no calls from creditors as factors that led him to\nassume there were no credit issues. (Tr. 37-38, 64)\n  \nApplicant has excelled in his position as production manager at his employer\u2019s\nmanufacturing facility. Under his direction, the quality of the company\u2019s finished product\nhas improved significantly with less delivery lead time required. After his interim\nclearance was granted, Applicant made several trips overseas to provide support to the\nU.S. military in theater. Applicant is held in high regard by those whom he supported\nand by his employer. He and his wife have access to confidential company accounting\ninformation and have not violated that trust. (Ex. F)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n7\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant and his spouse did not spend wisely and incurred obligations beyond\nwhat they could reasonably afford on their incomes. (Tr. 71, Ex. 3) An awareness of\ntheir financial situation led them to seek debt resolution in about 2002, and a delinquent\ncredit card debt of $5,237 was settled in July 2003 for less than the full balance.\nHowever, as of late 2003, Applicant owed delinquent debt of about $12,500 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e).  Rather than address these delinquent debts, he and his spouse\npurchased a timeshare in 2004. Security concerns are raised by \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)), by \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or\nirresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(b), and by \u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nAn additional credit card delinquency of $6,543 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was reported on\nApplicant\u2019s credit record as of November 2006 (Ex. 3), although Applicant was only an\nauthorized user on the VISA account. So while an authorized user can be held legally\nresponsible for its repayment, the evidence is inconclusive about who incurred the\ncharges and/or opened the account. The creditor removed the debt from Applicant\u2019s\ncredit report in September 2007. (Ex. A) The Government did not sufficiently establish\nthat Applicant faces the additional financial pressures of having to repay the $6,543\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness predates his job layoff in December 2004 as well as his\nspouse\u2019s unemployment. AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies only to his failure to\naddress his debts in the short-term. Concerned about their financial situation back in\n2002, Applicant and his spouse consulted with a debt resolution firm. Applicant knew\nthat they had been unable to follow through on their planned repayments, due largely to\nthe job layoff and his spouse\u2019s unemployment. Yet, once they were both gainfully\nemployed in June 2005, Applicant took no action to ensure that his delinquent\nobligations were repaid. It is no excuse that his spouse handled the family\u2019s finances.\nIn mitigation of this demonstrated financial irresponsibility, Applicant has taken\nrecent steps toward resolving his debt that implicate AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d). Prompted by\na desire to improve his credit so that he and his spouse might obtain a home mortgage\nunder favorable terms in the future, Applicant started repaying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in\nMay 2007. Financial records in evidence confirm Applicant has been making monthly\npayments in excess of the $314.56 required under the settlement agreement. While the\ndebt will not be completely satisfied until April 2008, he has demonstrated a track record\nof timely payments to conclude he is likely to pay off the debt as scheduled. As he\npromised in May 2007, he paid the $161 medical debt in collection (SOR \u00b6 1.e) within\n30 days. He has made three payments totaling $808.52 on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  His\nfailure to make any payments toward his debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is attributed to difficulty\ndetermining where any payments should be sent. The original creditor sold the account\nand the named assignee claims to have no record of the debt.\nAssuming the creditor collecting the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b does not cancel the\nsettlement agreement because of Applicant\u2019s failure to make the $1,774 balloon\npayment, Applicant owes about $6,000 in delinquent debt. This is not an\ninsurmountable burden since he and his spouse are both employed and have a positive\ncash flow. However, given Applicant\u2019s past discretionary spending for a boat and\ntimeshare, there must be adequate assurance that Applicant will not incur new\nobligations that will further stress his finances. In April 2006, he entered into a vehicle\nlease taking on a monthly repayment obligation of $585 for 36 months. Their need for a\nreliable four-wheel-drive vehicle is not disputed, and they have been current in their\npayments. Spending their savings on a vacation to California in June 2007 when they\nowed several creditors is more difficult to justify. On the other hand, Applicant testified\nthat he and his spouse \u201care a little bit smarter than what [they] were a few years ago.\u201d\nThey have significantly reduced their use of consumer credit. Both he and his spouse\nhave a low-limit credit card for emergencies. (Tr. 73-74) There is no evidence of any\nnew credit card delinquency, or of late rent or utility payments. They have made their\ntimeshare and boat payments on time since they have worked for the defense\ncontractor. Even if they are not successful in selling either of these assets, their financial\nsituation has sufficiently stabilized to allow them to continue to meet their current\nobligations and to make payments on the old delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(c)\n\n9\n(\u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d)\napply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAs of October 2006, when Applicant applied for a secret-level clearance, he\nowed  on accounts that had been charged off and/or placed for collection in 2003\n($4,128 on  \u00b6 1.b, $2,807 on \u00b6 1.c, $5,392 on \u00b6 1.d, and $161 on \u00b6 1.e). These debts\nshould have been reported in response to the financial delinquency inquiries pertinent to\ndebts over 180 days within the past seven years (section 28.a) and to debts currently\nover 90 days delinquent (section 28.b).  Applicant instead responded \u201cNo\u201d to both\nquestions. \nUnder AG \u00b6 16(a) personal conduct concerns are raised by the \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d Applicant does not contest that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the debt inquiries,\nbut submits he did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP. In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories in May 2007, Applicant explained, \u201cI thought that these debts had been\nreleased because the companies had them listed as \u2018charge offs\u2019 on my credit report.\u201d\n(Ex. 2) At his hearing, Applicant testified that he thought the debts were more than\nseven years in the past. His spouse handled the finances, he did not see his credit\nreport until January 2007, he was not receiving any calls from creditors, and he had\nbeen able to lease his spouse\u2019s vehicle in that time frame (i.e., April 2006):\nLike I said, we had been able to lease cars and, from what I was told, your\ncredit has to be decent enough to lease a car, so I did not realize we had\nany credit issues until we started looking into buying a home in January of\nthis year, and that\u2019s when we saw our first credit report for a while and\nthat\u2019s when we started working on these debts . . .  I\u2019ve been through a\nsecurity clearance check before when I was in the Service and I\u2019m not\nnaive enough to think they are not going to go back and check my history,\ncheck my credit history, so I didn\u2019t knowingly falsify these. . . . \n\n10\n(See Tr. 36-38)\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s debts were long delinquent when he completed his security\nclearance application, the record evidence does not support a good-faith belief that they\nwere more than seven years in the past. First, there is the discrepancy between his\nexplanation of May 2007, where he attributed the omission to the creditors reporting the\ndebts as charge offs on his credit record, and his testimony that he did not see his credit\nreport until January 2007, which would have been after he completed his SF 86.  When\nconfronted with the discrepancy, Applicant testified with respect to his May 2007\nexplanation, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I did that, probably, just because I had based it on seeing\nthe credit report instead of, I don\u2019t know.\u201d (Tr. 60) In the interrogatories, DOHA quoted\nthe language of the e-QIP financial delinquency inquiries. It stands to reason that had\nApplicant thought his debts were more than seven years in the past, he would have said\nso.\nMoreover, Applicant knew that he had financial problems as recently as 2002,\nwhen he and his spouse sought the assistance of a debt resolution firm:\nQ You indicated that you and your wife had; consulted a debt reduction--\nA Yes.\nQ \u2013company? When was that?\nA I knew you were going to ask that so I tried to remember it. It was in\n2002.\nQ So you knew in 2002 that you had delinquent debts?\nA Yes, at that time I did, but I did not realize, I didn\u2019t remember it was\nactually 2002, I thought it was further back than 2002 that we had entered\ninto that agreement.\nQ So you thought it was prior to 1999?\nA Yes.\nQ And what were the results of that relationship with that debt reduction\ncompany?\nA We were able to take care of a few debts, obviously not all of them, and\nwe weren\u2019t able to keep up with the program at that point, just because of\nother reasons, other things that happened and that kind of came along.\nQ Well, such as?\n\n11\nA I was laid off from my job in 2004, yeah, 2004 and--\nQ And--\nA \u2013we just weren\u2019t able to keep up with it. We thought we were going to be\nable to, we made a good attempt at trying to keep up with it at that point\nbut we just couldn\u2019t.\nQ So you stayed in the program for about two years?\nA Yes.\nQ Do you remember what month you were laid off in \u201804?\nA I believe it was December \u201804.\n(Tr. 65-66) It is simply not credible for Applicant to claim that he thought they had\nentered into the debt resolution agreement before 1999, given his admission to staying\nin the program for two years, and not being able to keep up because of his job loss in\nDecember 2004. Applicant admitted knowing they had been unable to repay all of their\ndebts as recently as December 2004, which was well within the seven-year scope of\nquestion 28 a. Applicant has not persuaded me that the omission of his debts was due\nto good faith mistake, to inability to recall, or some other cause that would negate the\nreasonable inference of knowing and willful concealment. Security concerns are raised\nunder AG \u00b6 16(a).\nConcerns as to whether Applicant has been fully candid about his e-QIP\nomissions preclude me from considering AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts\u201d), even though Applicant is credited with acknowledging  the\ndebts when he responded to the interrogatories or at his hearing. None of the other\npotentially mitigating conditions apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nWhen Applicant signed his security clearance application in October 2006, he\ncertified that his statements on the form and any attachments were \u201ctrue, complete and\ncorrect to the best of [his] knowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith,\u201d and that\nhe understood that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished by a fine or\n\n12\nimprisonment or both. By deliberately falsifying his responses to questions 28 a. and 28\nb., Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, which provides in pertinent part:\na) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter\nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the\nGovernment of the United States, knowing and willfully: (1) falsifies,\nconceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact: (2)\nmakes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document\nknowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent\nstatement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more\nthan 5 years, or both.\nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted\u201d) must be considered in evaluating Applicant\u2019s current security suitability. \nApplicant\u2019s false denials of any delinquent debts in October 2006 are too recent\nto consider AG \u00b6 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment). Applicant\u2019s disclosures of the details of his financial situation and his\ncontributions to his employer are some evidence of rehabilitation, but not enough to\nsatisfy AG \u00b6 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement\u201d). As noted above, Applicant presented inconsistent\nexplanations for his failure to admit to delinquent debt on his security clearance\napplication. Doubts persist about his rehabilitation, as he has yet to demonstrate that his\nrepresentations can be relied on.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n\n13\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. At work, Applicant has shown\nreliability and dedication. Albeit recent, he has taken significant steps to resolve the\nfinancial issues of concern to the Government (see AG \u00b6 2(a)(6)). The Government\nmust be assured that those persons granted access can be counted on to fulfill their\nfiduciary obligations irrespective of the personal cost. Fully aware of the importance of\nthe security clearance application because he had held a secret clearance for his duties\nin the U.S. military, Applicant elected to conceal his history of financial problems from\nthe Government. Even if he lacked knowledge of the financial details because his\nspouse handled the finances, he knew they had financial debts that they had not repaid.\nIt was incumbent upon him to at a minimum check with his spouse and he did not do so.\nWhile he now claims he did not have access to his spouse when he completed the\nquestionnaire, the evidence shows he had to re-sign the form a few days after he first\ncompleted it. There is no evidence that he made any effort during that time to determine\nthe status of their long overdue accounts. Concerns that he may place his personal\ninterests ahead of his fiduciary obligations preclude me from finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant him access.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Savarino, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen, Administrative Judge:\nOn October 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary\ndecision to deny his application for a security clearance. The SOR cited security\nconcerns under Guidelines M (misuse of information technology) and Guideline E\n(personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, admitting all of the allegations therein,\nand requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2008, and I\nscheduled a hearing to be held on April 1, 2008. The parties appeared as scheduled.\nThe government presented seven exhibits (GE. 1 - 7). Applicant testified, offered 44\nexhibits (AE. A - OO), and presented six witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\nApril 15, 2008\n\n2\non April 10, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline M, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was\ncounseled in May 2004 for viewing, downloading and/or sending pornography on his\ngovernment computer and/or government networks system. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the\ngovernment alleged Applicant was investigated by the Office of the Inspector General\non December 22, 2004, concerning continued misuse of government equipment and\ncommunications systems; that the investigation revealed that Applicant had viewed,\ndownloaded and/or sent pornography depicting nude women and adults engaged in\nsexually explicit acts on his government computer and/or government networks system;\nthat Applicant received a formal letter of reprimand with a two-year probation condition\nthat any future infractions will be termination for cause; and that an adverse report was\nfiled on June 6, 2005. \nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a the same information\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered as facts. After a thorough\nreview of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 51 years old. Since November 2000, he has worked as a systems\nanalyst for a defense contractor. He has held a top secret clearance in the military and\nin his civilian career. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) from 1977 until\nDecember 2000 (Tr. 129). He is married with no children.\nApplicant works as part of a team to support the Navy-Marine Corps Intranet\n(NMCI). He works with other government employees and contractors. He is the contract\ntechnical representative who provides technical support to the Director, NMCI. He is\nalso the assistant security officer. His clearance affords him access to government\nfacilities and national security information (GE 1).\nIn 2003, Applicant received joke emails on his government computer from high\nranking officials and service personnel that contained inappropriate material. The emails\nincluded photographs and videos of nude women. He forwarded these emails to a\ngroup of friends and other Marines in his address book. He admitted that he viewed and\ndownloaded the pornographic images (depicting nude women and adults engaged in\nsexually explicit acts) in violation of policy, contract and regulations. In May 2004,\nApplicant was counseled by his employer to discontinue the use (GE 2). However, he\ncontinued the practice when he received more emails in the following months (Tr. 135).\nWhen Applicant spoke to one of his supervisors about the emails in 2004, his supervisor\njoked and told him not to do it again (Tr 137). \nIn March 2005, Applicant received a phone call from an investigator in the\nInspector Generals Office (IG). The Applicant answered questions concerning the\ninappropriate email use on the computer at work. After the telephone conversation,\nApplicant reported to his supervisor. He told him about the phone call and his\nadmissions concerning the inappropriate emails that he forwarded and his visits to\n\n3\npornographic sites. After the investigation, a Report of Adverse Information was issued\non June 1, 2005. (GE 1). \nApplicant voluntarily sought counseling after his conversation with the IG office.\nHe was concerned about any problems that he might have. He saw a military\npsychologist and psychiatrist at a naval hospital (AE NN). He also enrolled in an \u201cEthics\nin Cyberspace\u201d course. After numerous counseling visits, Applicant received no\ndiagnosis of any kind and no treatment or medications were prescribed (Tr 146). \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained he had not received security training about\naccessing unauthorized web sites. He acknowledged that he did sign Employee\nHandbook but did not read it. He realizes that is ono excuse for his behavior.\nApplicant told his wife about the investigation and his use of the computer to visit\nand download pornographic sites. He had conversations with management and\ngovernment personnel. He received a formal letter of reprimand and was put on a two-\nyear probation with the written condition that any future infractions will result in\nimmediate termination for cause (GE 1 at 2). He successfully completed his probation in\n2007.\nApplicant has rearranged his office. His computer is now in full sight so that the\nmonitor is visible to all persons passing his door. He admits that he misused his NMCI\ntechnology system. His behavior in downloading pornographic material from the internet\ncould put the intranet system in danger. He admits his judgment was poor, despite the\nfact that he was receiving the emails from other government personnel. Applicant did\nnot really think that forwarding the emails was inappropriate since others in the\ncompany were sending the joke emails. He also was shown the pornographic sites by\nsome of the personnel in company. He was adamant when testifying that he now knows\nit was inappropriate conduct and could jeopardize the security system. He was credible\nin his testimony that he would never repeat such conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s work record with the defense contractor since November 2000 is\nexemplary in every respect. Several government, military, and company associates and\nsuperiors have lauded his superior efforts and expertise. His performance before and\nafter the incident with the computer is flawless. He is competent and professional. His\ncoworkers applaud him as a man of character. He continues to have access to sensitive\nprivacy-act protected information. At the hearing, his supervisors and colleagues\nrepeatedly praised him as having an impeccable work ethic; strong character,\ndependable, reliable, honest, trustworthy and willing to maintain policies established\nwithin the organization. (AE OO). His military record is replete with awards and\ncommendations (AE A-LL). Each witness praised Applicant for his competence and\nintegrity. In 2007, Applicant received another commendation from his employer for\nexemplary service (AE F).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n1\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n2\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n4\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n5\n4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n1\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n2\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under Guideline M (misuse of information technology systems), at\nAG \u00b6 39, and Guideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n3\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n4\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.5\nAnalysis\nMisuse of Information Technology Systems.\nUnder Guideline M, \u201c[n]oncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\n\n5\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information\nTechnology Systems include all related  computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39). The government presented sufficient information\nto support the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b. Further, the information presented\nrequires application of the disqualifying condition listed at AG \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use\nof a government or other information technology system).\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant has admitted his misuse of his government\ncomputer when he forwarded emails that contained nude photos of women, and when\nhe visited and downloaded pornographic sites from at least 2003 until 2005. \nThe record supports consideration of the Guideline M mitigating conditions listed\nin AG \u00b6 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). This conduct was not\nrecent. His last misuse was in 2005. Applicant has demonstrated through successful\ncompletion of his two-year probation and no further violations that his actions do not\nreflect adversely on his \u201creliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d (AG \u00b6 41(a))\nIndeed, his actions show a willingness to gain psychiatric help and counseling to assure\nhimself and the government that there was no other problem. He has received\ncommendations since the incidents. His employer has recommended that he remain in\nhis position. He has been open and honest with all involved. He is remorseful. He has\ntaken a course on ethics. He is committed to his work and does not want to let his\nemployer down. Any future transgressions will result in his termination.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nApplicant may not be disqualified under Guideline E for the SOR \u00b6 2.a allegation. The\nrecord shows that conduct is specifically covered under Guideline M and must be\naddressed according to AG \u00b6 40(b), as discussed above.\nHowever, even considering a personal conduct disqualification under Guideline\nE, Applicant has presented evidence of mitigation. Under Personal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition \u00b617 (d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) Applicant has met his\nburden by taking the steps and actions that are discussed under Guideline M.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines M and E. I have also\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n6\n6\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult whose recent job performance has been exemplary.\n6\nHe has maintained a security clearance for many years. His military record is replete\nwith awards. He was open and honest about the joke emails that he received. At first,\nhe did not realize the import of such emails, but he does not use that as an excuse. He\ntook responsibility for his conduct, and he volunteered to seek counselling from the\nmilitary psychiatrist and psychologist. His employer trusts him to maintain his assistant\nsecurity position.  He has rearranged his office computer so that anyone can see the\ndisplay monitor anytime they pass his door. He was cooperative with his investigators.\nThe record of behavioral change and rehabilitation is sufficient to show he is unlikely to\nrepeat his conduct in the future. The record is sufficient to overcome the adverse\ninformation about Applicant\u2019s conduct.  Applicant has mitigated the security concerns\nunder misuse of technology and personal conduct.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                                                    \nNOREEN A LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Tr. at 9.\n2\n Tr. at 10-12,\n3\n Tr. at 5-6. \n4\n Tr. at 52, 69-70; Gov 1, Section 15. \n5\n2\nOn July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued  Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, of\nthe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated September 10, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on\nOctober 25, 2007. On October 25, 2007, a notice of hearing was sent scheduling the hearing for\nNovember 8, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Applicant waived the 15 day notice\nrequirement provided in the Directive.  The government motioned to amend the SOR to add \u00b6\u00b6 1.n,\n2\n1.o, and 1.p. The SOR was amended without objection.  The government offered three exhibits\n3\nwhich were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1-3 without objection. Applicant called one\nwitness and admitted 15 exhibits which were admitted as AE A - O without objection. The record\nwas held open until December 10, 2007, in order to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.\nApplicant timely submitted an 18 page document that was admitted as AE P without objection.  The\ntranscript was received on November 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his SOR response, Applicant admits to all of the allegations in the SOR. In addition, after\na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old man employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is\napplying for a security clearance. He has been with his current employer for approximately a year\nand a half. He has a bachelor's degree in engineering. He has held a security clearance since 1982.4\nHe married his wife in 1998. He and his wife have a child, age 2.  His wife has four children from\na prior marriage. Three of the children, ages 18, 15 and 13, reside with Applicant and his wife. They\noccasionally provide support to his wife's adult daughter, who recently separated from her husband.5\n\n Tr. at 28; Gov 1, Section 22.\n6\n Tr. at 30-31.\n7\n Tr. at 31.\n8\n Tr. at 34; AE M.  \n9\n Gov 1. \n10\n Gov 2; Gov 3.\n11\n Gov 2. \n12\n3\nApplicant's financial problems were caused by two periods of unemployment. He was first\nlaid off in March 2000 for approximately three months as a result of a company merger. In October\n2002, he was let go due to the company downsizing.  \n6\nAfter he found full-time employment in October 2003, he attempted to resolve his delinquent\naccounts but found most creditors uncooperative when attempting to work out a payment agreement.\nThe creditors wanted the debts paid off as quickly as possible.  Attempts to resolve the accounts were\nplaced on hold because Applicant was unable to meet the creditor's demands.  \n7\nIn March 2006, Applicant accepted a position with his current company at substantially more\npay. He sold his home at his previous job location and attempted to pay off some of his creditors;\nbut they still wanted the debt paid off immediately.  He purchased a new home at his new job\n8\nlocation. Applicant admits that they over-extended themselves on the new house.9\nOn December 1, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) in relation to his employment with the defense contractor. He listed his\ndelinquent debts in response to Section 28: Your Financial Delinquencies.   His subsequent\n10\nbackground investigation revealed 16 debts, an approximate total of $54,518. The debts include an\n$8,000 debt owed to the IRS for tax year 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $2,222 credit card account that was\ncharged off in August 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $22,732 credit card account placed for collection in\nJanuary 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a $19,043 credit card account placed for collection in February 2004\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $295 gas station credit card account placed for collection in February 2004 (SOR \u00b6\n1.e); an $821 account placed for collection in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $50 medical account placed\nfor collection in August 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); a $220 telephone account placed for collection in October\n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a $261 telephone account placed for collection in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.i);\na $281 cable company account placed for collection in April 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a $217 utility bill\nplaced for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a $186 utility bill placed for collection in July 2006\n(SOR \u00b6 1.l); and a $90 gas bill placed for collection in September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.m).11\nThe amendment to the SOR alleged the following debts: a $750 gas station credit card placed\nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.n); a $735 account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and a $224 charged\noff gas station credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.p).12\n\n Tr. at 34; AE M.\n13\n Tr. at 34; AE L.\n14\n Tr. at 53. \n15\n Tr. at 34. \n16\n Tr. at 37-38, 65-66.\n17\n Tr. at 37-38; AE A; AE J; AE K and AE M.\n18\n AE E; AE F. \n19\n Tr. at 22, AE E; AE N.\n20\n Tr. at 61-62. \n21\n Tr. at 40; AE G. \n22\n4\nApplicant considered bankruptcy but thought there were other options other than filing for\nbankruptcy. He deeded his recently purchased home back to the mortgage company.  He and his\n13\nfamily now rent a house that is half the cost of his mortgage payment. His mortgage payments were\n$2,668.  He now pays $1,300 in rent.  His plans are to pay off the large debts first and then pay off\n14\n15\nthe smaller debts.16\nIn August 2007, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS related to the\n$8,000 income tax debt. Applicant claims that he filed an extension in tax year 2003. The IRS claims\nthey did not receive the extension. Applicant intends to dispute this in the future but is currently\npaying on the debt.  The current balance on the account is $4,660. He agreed to pay $101 per month\n17\nbeginning October 1, 2007. He has shown proof that he has made the October and November 2007\npayments.18\nOn August 30, 2007, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt settlement company.\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f are included in the plan. He agreed to pay $500 per month during\nthe plan. Payment was made in September.  A payment was not made in October due to a dispute\n19\nwith the debt settlement company.  Payments are to resume in November and the debt settlement\n20\ncompany does not consider Applicant behind on his payments.21\nA judgment was obtained against Applicant for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. The total\namount of the judgment was $18,104.57 plus $438.97 pre-filing interest. On October 18, 2007,\nApplicant agreed to pay $520 per month until the judgment is paid in full. The debt settlement\ncompany was handling these payments.22\nAfter the hearing, Applicant discovered that his annual bonus was larger that he anticipated.\n\n AE P at 7.\n23\n AE P at 3-4.\n24\n AE P at 5-6.\n25\n5\nHe was awarded a $12,301 bonus. After taxes, he received $8,308 in bonus money.  He used the\n23\nmoney to settle and pay off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. On December 7, 2007, he settled the\ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $7,000.   On that same date, he also settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $1,111.\n24\n25\nThe current status of the delinquent debts are as follows:\nSOR\nParagraph\nDebt\nStatus\nRecord\n1.a\n$8,000 income tax debt owed\nto the IRS.

His total monthly expenses were approximately $4,900. The balance remaining is $909.30\nIn 2007, Applicant earned over $112,000 (including the bonus).  His wife gets $671 bi-monthly in\n31\nchild support. They have two car payments of $300 and $368 monthly. The car loan with the $300\npayment will be paid off by the end of the year.  Applicant took an on-line course on how to budget\n32\nwhen he was considering filing for bankruptcy.  \n33\nApplicant's former supervisor at his previous job testified. He has known Applicant since\n2004. He was very pleased with his work performance. He recommended that his current employer\nhire Applicant based on his past performance. He works for the same company but in a different\ndepartment. He said the current company they work for has better pay and better conditions at work.\nHe states that Applicant is a good character. He is aware of his financial problems but believes he\nhas proven himself capable to protect classified information.  \n34\nPerformance reviews in 2006 and 2007 with Applicant's current employer were favorable.\nHis most recent performance review indicated that he is a valuable asset to the team.35\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n36\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 18. \n37\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n38\n Id.\n39\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n40\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n41\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n42\n8\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.37\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n38\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n39\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n40\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.41\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n42\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n9\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nFinancial Considerations\nSince 2002, Applicant has experienced financial difficulties. Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) applies. FC DC \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending\nbeyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash\nflow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis) applies. Applicant admits that he\npurchased a home that he could not afford when he moved to his current location. At the time the\nSOR was issued, Applicant had approximately 13 delinquent debts with an approximate total balance\nof $54,518. Some of the debts became delinquent as a result of two job layoffs Applicant suffered in\n2000 and 2002.  However, many of these debts became delinquent after Applicant obtained full-time\nemployment. Four of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 1.l and 1.m) became delinquent after Applicant\nstarted employment with his current employer. The balance on each of these debts is under $300.\nApplicant earns over $100,000 annually. He is capable of paying these debts. His most recent\ndelinquent debts appear to be related to financial irresponsibility as opposed to an unwillingness to\npay.  \nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  While Applicant\nhas seriously started to address his delinquent debts within the past several months, he still has several\nunresolved delinquent accounts. He has taken significant steps towards resolving his financial\nproblems, but at the close of the record, they were not fully resolved.  For these reasons FC MC \u00b6\n20(a) does not apply.  \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\napplies in part. Applicant was laid off for three months in 2000 and for one year in 2002.  However,\nhe continued to incur delinquent debts after becoming employed full-time and Applicant continued\nto make poor financial decisions such as purchasing a home he could not afford.  For these reasons,\nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight.\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) applies.  Applicant has entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS\npertaining to his 2003 tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He has paid off close to half the debt. He entered into an\nagreement with a debt repayment company to make payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d and\n1.f. A larger than expected annual bonus allowed the Applicant to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.d after the hearing. Applicant's intends to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l,\nand 1.m beginning in January 2008.  While a promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate\nthe security concerns under financial considerations, the total balance on these debts is $1,700 which\nis relatively minor compared to the other delinquent accounts that Applicant has paid or is actively\npaying on. He has demonstrated a good faith effort to resolve his delinquent accounts. He is\n\n10\nattempting to reduce his expenses as well. He deeded his home back to the bank and his rent is much\nlower than his mortgage payments.  He is taking appropriate actions to resolve his financial problems.\n   \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. I considered Applicant's favorable employment history, the favorable recommendation\nof his friend and former supervisor, his 25 year history of holding a security clearance, and his current\nactions in attempting to resolve his financial delinquencies.  The security concerns raised under\nfinancial considerations are mitigated. Based on the evidence in the record, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2.

Dunn, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \nOn March 22, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On December 17, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 18, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on February 25, \n2008.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 10, 2008, and I convened the \nMay 13, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nhearing as scheduled on April 1, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n4 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits (AE) A \nthrough N without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April \n9, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 12). The request and the attached documents were \nnot admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Administrative Notice \nExhibits (Exh.) I through V. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object to my consideration of \nthose Exhibits. (Id.). Hence, the facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of \ngeneral knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable dispute. Those facts are set \nout in the Findings of Fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated January 18, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated into \nthe following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He was born in Iraq. He graduated from high school in \n1984, and was involuntarily conscripted into the Iraqi army from 1986 to 1989. From \n1990 to 1997, he was married to his cousin, an Iraqi citizen.  \n \n \nIn 1991, Applicant and three brothers left Iraq because they did not want to serve \nin Saddam Hussein\u2019s army or regime. (Tr. 88). They became refugees in Saudi Arabia \nfor three years before arriving in the United States in August 1994. He became a \nnaturalized citizen in August 2000. (Tr. 45). Subsequent to his arrival here, he worked at \nvarious jobs and experienced a period of unemployment. He began his current position \nas a linguist with a federal contract in March 2004.  He wanted to work for the U.S. \ntroops out of his sense of gratitude and loyalty to the United States for allowing him to \nemigrate here.  (Tr. 94). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. His father is deceased and his elderly \nmother resides there. She is 72 years old and was a housewife. He is one of ten \nchildren, all born in Iraq. Three brothers reside in the United States. One of those \nbrothers is a naturalized citizen and two of them are permanent residents. One of his \nbrothers is deceased and the other brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. His four \nsisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. (Tr. 77-78). \n \n \nApplicant lives with one of his brothers, who is a permanent resident in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 75: GE 4). He has some contact with another brother living here, but \ndoes not communicate with the other brother. (Tr. 71-73). He has not had any contact \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nwith his brother or four sisters, who reside in Iraq, since he left in 1991. (Tr. 79). He \nappears to be estranged from his siblings living there.   \n \n \nAfter leaving Iraq in 1991, Applicant maintained some contact with his mother, \nalthough he did not see her again until September 2001, when he saw her in Syria \nwhere she was visiting. (GE 4). At that time, his mother introduced him to an Iraqi \nwoman. In May 2002, he returned to Syria and married his second wife. She came to \nthe United States in October 2003. (Tr. 51). When he returned home from Iraq in \nOctober 2004, he discovered his wife had moved out of their residence. (Tr. 55).  After \nshe left, he stopped communicating with her. He has no knowledge of her whereabouts, \nas she married another man. They were divorced in January 2008. (AE A). \n \n \nApplicant began working as an Arabic translator for the U.S. Army in March \n2004. From that time until January 2008, he worked in Iraq at various locations. He \ngenerally worked for six or seven months and then returned home for a couple weeks \nbefore going back for additional tours. While in Iraq, he did not contact any of his family \nsiblings, but spoke to his mother every few months. (Tr. 59; 94; GE 4). None of his \nfamily, living in Iraq, is aware of his work with the U.S. forces. (Tr. 87).  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted several exhibits attesting to his capabilities and contributions \nto the U.S. Armed Forces\u2019 efforts in the war on terror. In October 2004, a lieutenant \ncolonel of the Army brigade combat team for which Applicant worked, wrote a letter of \nrecommendation. He stated that \u201c[Applicant was employed as an Arabic Interpreter for \nMulti National Force Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, from 01 May to 29 \nOctober 2004 . . . [Applicant\u2019s ability to translate Arabic into English and his quick \nthinking made the difference between success and failure for out unit\u2019s mission.\u201d (AE \nH).  A major in that combat team noted an incident in September 2004 in which \nApplicant risked his life for a team member after their convoy was attacked by an \nexplosive device. \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] actions were well above and beyond the actions \nrequired of an interpreter. His assistance was instrumental in saving the lives of two of \nthe wounded soldiers.\u201d (AE I).  A lieutenant colonel working with Applicant from March \n2005 to April 2005, stated, Applicant \u201cwas able to interpret flawlessly in all conditions.\u201d \n(AE J). \n \n \n  A captain for the U.S. Army wrote in January 2006 that Applicant \u201cis a dedicated \nworker who is willing to perform any assignment and any hours assigned to him.\u201d (AE \nK). The captain and platoon leader of Applicant\u2019s division from July 2006 to October \n2006, wrote in Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation that \u201c[Applicant] participated in over \n70 missions with coalition forces.\u201d (AE L).  \u201c[Applicant] worked with US Army leadership \nto help find, disrupt, and eliminate terrorist cells in and around the [city] area. [Applicant] \nbravely supported coalition forces everyday without fail. He faced personal danger and \nadversity with superior courage.\u201d (Id.). Applicant received a Certificate of Appreciation \nfrom a Special Forces airborne company for his outstanding support from June 1, 2007 \nto August 1, 2007. (AE N).           \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant previously owned two houses in 1999. (Tr. 85). He has a U.S. bank \naccount. He does not own any property in Iraq. (Tr. 93). There is no derogatory \ninformation concerning his police record. He has never been fired from a job or \narrested. He has never used illegal drugs, or been involved in an alcohol-related \nincident. (GE 1).  \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship at this \nhearing and desire to resume his work with the U.S. Army. He stated (sic), \u201cSo I mean I \nloyal to United State because it give me citizen, safe for my life and my brother, and \nthey give me everything, benefit here, and freedom. I mean why not if I go help the \nAmerican.\u201d (Tr. 94). Currently, he is unemployed because his contract terminated, as a \nresult of his security clearance issues. (Tr. 64; 90). He likes his job and wants to return \nto Iraq. He held an Interim Secret security clearance while in Iraq and handled classified \ninformation without breaching security regulations.      \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have target the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis.  Although the new governmental has taken \naggressive action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high, as do \nhuman rights abuses. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \nstate intelligence services.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel....\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interest, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother and four sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. He \nhas periodic contact with his mother. While Iraq struggles with the creation of a \ndemocracy, it continues to be routinely victimized by terrorist attacks. This creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIt also creates a potential conflict of interest for Applicant. AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interests. In 1991, he came here as a refugee and proudly became a \nnaturalized citizen in 2000. He worked at various jobs since his arrival, until beginning \nhis position with a federal contractor in 2004. He does not own any property in Iraq, but \nhas a U.S. bank account. He has a close relationship with one of his brothers, with \nwhom he resides in the United States. He is estranged from his siblings living in Iraq, \nand has periodic contact with his mother, residing there. He did not return to Iraq until \n2004, when he started his job with the U.S. forces. While there he did not communicate \n                                                          \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nwith his siblings. His ties to the United States are much stronger than his ties to his five \nsiblings and elderly mother living in Iraq. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has limited application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with his mother, \nbrother and four sisters. Since leaving Iraq in 1991, he has not had any contact with his \nsiblings. He saw his mother once in 2001, and contacts her periodically. None of them \nknow about the nature of his work. Although there is a remote possibility that terrorists \ncould attempt to coerce or threaten Applicant through his mother or siblings, it is highly \nunlikely.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even \nfriendly governments, could attempt to use his siblings and mother, who live in Iraq, to \nobtain such information. Second, he had connections to Iraq before he left there in \n1991. He was born in Iraq and spent his formative years there. Third, his mother and \nfive siblings remain citizens and residents of Iraq. Fourth, he maintains some contact \nwith his mother. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. Applicant is a mature person. He came to the United States as a refugee in \n1994 and became a naturalized citizen in 2000.  He has worked in the United States \nsince his arrival and currently resides with his brother, who also came here as a \nrefugee. He previously owned property in the United States, and currently has a bank \naccount. Out of his sense of gratitude and dedication to the United States, he joined the \nU.S. Army, as an Arabic-speaking linguist. He takes his loyalty to the United States very \nseriously, and has worked diligently for a defense contractor for more than two years in \nan important capacity for our troops. I give great weight to the letters of \nrecommendation, written by the soldiers with whom he served. They assess him as \nloyal and trustworthy, and praise his significant contributions to the cause of freedom in \nIraq. After leaving Iraq in 1991, he did not return for 13 years and then solely for the \npurpose of helping the United States. No witnesses recommended denial of his security \nclearance. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States or failed to abide by his employer\u2019s rules and \nregulations.  \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his tenure in Iraq without any \nindication that he breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not \nnormally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the nation security. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, \nand report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In his answer to the SOR, he\nstated payment was forthcoming on six small accounts for a total of $1,957 (AE C).\nSome of the accounts are as small as $100.  As noted above, one is paid and he is\nmaking monthly payments on the tax lien. He is also paying $400 a month in child\nsupport for his 15-year-old (Tr. 51). \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $2,500, which includes his wife\u2019s\nsalary. After monthly expenses and payment on some debt, he has no money left\n(Tr.47). He is current with his car payment. Applicant paid for a 2000 vehicle that he has\nin 2006 (Tr. 15).\nApplicant has not received financial counseling and he does not contemplate\nfiling for bankruptcy.  He has no savings at this time. Although he desires to pay his\ndelinquent debts, he states he cannot do so until the IRS lien is paid.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19\u00a9, Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts and could not meet his\nfinancial obligations from 2001 until the present. He had tax liens. The evidence is\n\n6\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries are partially the result of his relationship with his longtime\ngirlfriend who opened accounts in his name without his knowledge. He also had a\nperiod of illness in 2004 after he was laid off from one job. He incurred a significant\nmedical bill without the benefit of medical insurance. His delinquent debts, however,\nhave various sources and have been ongoing. This potentially mitigating condition does\nnot apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, his\nfinancial problems may have been exacerbated, but Applicant did not act responsibly in\nidentifying and resolving his debts that preceded those events. He did not take an active\nstance when he learned about many of them.  Applicant has worked steadily for many\nyears with a few periods of unemployment. I find this potentially mitigating condition\ndoes not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20\u00a9. This does not apply. Applicant has no budget\nand has had no financial counseling. He is paying one debt (tax lien) through a\ngarnishment. He does not have a handle on his financial affairs. \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has paid\none tax lien and is paying on the second. He has contacted his creditors and is\npromising to pay the accounts. He waited many years before attempting to resolve his\nfinancial issues.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies in part.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that some of the\nalleged debts were unknown to him and were accounts opened by his ex-girlfriend. He\nhas not provided sufficient documentation for this assertion and he has not tried to\ncollect any money from her. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does not\napply.\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2\u00a9, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is not sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant has worked all his life. He supports his family and his five children. He\nhad some unemployment and ill health that affected his ability to pay his bills for a\nnumber of years. He also disputes some of the accounts due to his ex-girlfriend.\nApplicant promises to pay the debts when he can. He has tried to settle some of his\nmedical accounts but does not have a sufficient amount to do so.\nApplicant has not sought financial counseling nor does he have a budget or a\nplan to restructure his debt and begin repayment. Some of the debts are \u201cold\u201d and they\nare not on his credit report and he relies on that for dispute purposes. Applicant has\nabout $45,000 in delinquent debt remaining. He has no ability to pay at this point in time\nbecause he has no money left after he pays his expenses. Given the significant debt,\nApplicant\u2019s positive characteristics have not overcome the security concerns.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c- 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Iran and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he possesses an Iranian passport that does not expire until July 17, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), which he used to enter and/or exit Iran in at least June 2006 to August 2006 and August 2007 to September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that on February 14, 2007, he expressed uncertainty as to what action he would take if required to relinquish that Iranian passport for his clearance (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline B, foreign influence, DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather are resident citizens of Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant\u2019s grandmothers, aunts, uncles, and cousins are resident citizens of Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and that Applicant traveled to Qatar to visit his family in August 2000, July 2001, and August 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.c).

On October 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines C and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nIn an undated written response received by DOHA on November 30, 2007,\nApplicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. On January 4, 2008, Department Counsel indicated the\ngovernment was prepared to proceed, but at the same time moved for administrative\nnotice of certain facts pertinent to the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran). On January 18,\n2008, I granted Applicant until February 7, 2008, to file any objections and/or to propose\nMarch 31, 2008\n\n2\nalternative facts for administrative notice, and notified both parties that a hearing would\nbe held on February 27, 2008. Applicant did not respond by the due date. On February\n1, 2008, I issued a notice scheduling a hearing  for February 27, 2008.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3)\nwere admitted without any objections and Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript\n(Tr.) received by DOHA on March 7, 2008. The record was held open until March 12,\n2008, for Applicant to submit evidence of whether he would be permitted to enter Iran if\nhe was to surrender his Iranian passport. No documentation was submitted by the\ndeadline. For the reasons discussed below, eligibility for access to classified information\nis denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn January 4, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be\ntaken of certain facts about Iran and its relationship with the United States. The request\nwas based on publications from the U.S. State Department, the Congressional\nResearch Service, and on two releases from The White House. The government\u2019s\nformal request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were\nincluded in the record. \nAt the hearing on February 27, 2008, Applicant was given an additional\nopportunity to respond to the request for administrative notice. He had no comment or\nobjection. I agreed to take administrative notice of the facts requested by the\ngovernment. The most pertinent are set out in the Findings of Fact.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercises\ndual citizenship with Iran and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he possesses an Iranian\npassport that does not expire until July 17, 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), which he used to enter\nand/or exit Iran in at least June 2006 to August 2006 and August 2007 to September\n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that on February 14, 2007, he expressed uncertainty as to what\naction he would take if required to relinquish that Iranian passport for his clearance\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline B, foreign influence, DOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s\nmother and stepfather are resident citizens of Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant\u2019s\ngrandmothers, aunts, uncles, and cousins are resident citizens of Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.b), and\nthat Applicant traveled to Qatar to visit his family in August 2000, July 2001, and August\n2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Applicant admitted the allegations with the exception of SOR \u00b6 2.b,\nas while both grandmothers are Iranian resident citizens, he had only one aunt and one\nuncle as well as his cousins in Iran. After consideration of the evidence of record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\n\n3\nApplicant is a 24-year-old electrical engineer who has been on an approved\nleave of absence from his defense contractor employment since Fall 2007 while\npursuing his master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering (Tr. 34-36). He has worked for his\nemployer during school breaks (Tr. 36). Applicant began his employment with the\ncompany in August 2006 as a systems engineer I (Ex. 1), and he is seeking his first\nsecurity clearance.\nApplicant was born in Iran in April 1983 to native Iranian citizens (Ex. 1). When\nApplicant was four, his parents divorced and his father moved to the U.S. (Tr. 39). Both\nparents since remarried, his mother in about 1992 (Tr. 38, 42) and his father in about\n1997 (Tr. 43). Applicant was then raised in Iran by his mother and stepfather. In 1999,\nApplicant moved to the U.S. to be with his father (Tr. 38, 45) and to take advantage of\neducational opportunities here (Tr. 45-46). He entered the U.S. on an Iranian passport\nissued in June 1999 (Ex. 1).\nApplicant lived with his father and native-born U.S. citizen mother (Tr. 55) while\nattending  public high school in the U.S. (Tr. 38). When he was still in high school, he\ntraveled to Qatar for four to five weeks during the summers of 2000 and 2001 to see his\nmother (Tr. 65-66). She lived for a short time with her sister before getting a place of her\nown, and worked in Qatar as a jewelry store clerk so that she could send money back to\nher mother in Iran (Tr. 66). Applicant\u2019s aunt in Qatar is a beautician (Ex. 1, Ex. 2). \nFrom September 2002 to June 2006, Applicant pursued his bachelor of science\ndegree in electrical engineering at a state university (Tr. 39). On July 18, 2003,\nApplicant renewed his Iranian passport for another five years. It is scheduled to expire\non July 17, 2008 (Ex. 2). The summer following his freshman year, he returned to Qatar\nto see his mother in August 2003, and again stayed for four to five weeks (Tr. 65-66).\nHe entered and exited Qatar on his Iranian passport (Ex. 1, Ex. 2). Applicant\u2019s mother\nmoved back to Iran in about 2004 (Tr. 68).\nOn June 1, 2005, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen (Ex. 1, Tr. 39). He\ntook an oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S.\nConstitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian\nservice on behalf of the U.S. if required. He took no action to relinquish his Iranian\ncitizenship. On September 12, 2005, Applicant was issued his U.S. passport (Ex. 1, Ex.\n2, Tr. 46).\nAfter he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in June 2006,\nApplicant traveled to Iran in August 2006 for about six weeks to see his mother,\nstepfather, maternal grandmother and other relatives (Tr. 63-64). He stayed with his\nmother and stepfather during his visit (Tr. 64). Applicant paid for the trip with monies\nearned from being a teaching assistant at the university (Ex. 2). He left the U.S. on his\nU.S. passport and entered Iran using his Iranian passport (Tr. 49). Applicant showed his\nU.S. and Iranian passport at the airport when exiting Iran (Tr. 52, 77).\n\n4\nIn August 2006, Applicant began working for his current employer as a test\nengineer in air traffic control (Tr. 41). On October 26, 2006, Applicant applied for a\nsecurity clearance for his duties. On his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed his dual citizenship\nwith the U.S. and Iran and his possession of U.S. and Iranian passports. He also\nreported his mother and stepfather\u2019s Iranian residency and citizenship, his father\u2019s dual\ncitizenship with the U.S. since April 2003 and Iran from birth, and his stepmother\u2019s\nIranian citizenship but U.S. residency. Concerning any foreign travel within the last\nseven years, Applicant listed pleasure travel to Canada in July 1999 and April 2004, to\nQatar in August 2000, July 2001, and August 2003, and to Iran from June to August\n2006 (Ex. 1).\nOn February 14, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense about his ties to Iran, including his possession of an Iranian\npassport and his foreign travel. Applicant explained that he renewed his Iranian\npassport because he had been told that as an Iranian citizen living and working in the\nU.S., he would not be granted the visa needed to visit his family in Iran on his U.S.\npassport. Applicant expressed uncertainty as to what he would do if he had to relinquish\nhis Iranian passport or citizenship to acquire a security clearance. Applicant averred that\nhe was maintaining his Iranian citizenship solely for the visa to visit his family members\nin Iran. Applicant added that by not fulfilling his military service for Iran, and by acquiring\nhis U.S. citizenship, he had lost the rights and privileges afforded Iranian citizens, i.e.,\nthe rights to own property, have a bank account, or enter into a marriage in Iran.\nApplicant expressed his belief that he could regain those rights by fulfilling his military\nservice in Iran but he does not intend to do so. Applicant discussed his foreign travel, to\ninclude to Iran to visit his family from June 2006 to August 2006, and his ongoing\ntelephone contact with his mother on a regular basis. While she knows of his employer,\nhe had not told her or any of his other relatives in Iran that he was being considered for\na security clearance (Ex. 2).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant furnished the government with\ncopies of his current U.S. and Iranian passports, which are scheduled to expire on\nSeptember 11, 2015, and July 17, 2008, respectively (Ex. 2). Asked about any foreign\ntravel since August 2006, Applicant also reported in September 2007 that he had\ntraveled to Iran to visit his family from August 1, 2007 to September 2, 2007, with both\nhis U.S. and Iranian passport, and that he had used his Iranian passport to enter Iran\n(Ex. 3, Tr. 60). When Applicant was in Iran in 2007, he also visited with his mother\u2019s\nbrother and aunt and his father\u2019s sister (Tr. 60).  \nAs of late February 2008, Applicant still had dual citizenship with Iran and the\nU.S. and possession of current U.S. and Iranian passports. He intends to renew his\nIranian passport should he plan a trip to Iran to see his mother, stepfather, and\ngrandmother as he understands he would need an Iranian passport to enter Iran (Tr.\n\nAs reported by the U.S. State Department, U.S. citizens who were born in Iran\u2013even those without Iranian\n1\npassports who do not consider themselves Iranian\u2013are considered Iranian nationals by Iranian authorities.\nUnder Iranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport unless the Iranian government has\nrecognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. See Consular Information Sheet, June 5, 2007.\n5\n50).  Because of his foreign residency, Applicant is allowed re-entry into Iran once\n1\nyearly for a duration of less than three months without having to fulfill his military service\nobligation (Tr. 51). He does not intend to renounce his Iranian citizenship because he\ndoes not believe he would be allowed into the country if he did so (Tr. 31). He does not\nintend to return to Iran to live (Tr. 32, 80). His loyalties lie with the U.S. (Tr. 80).\nAs of February 2008, Applicant\u2019s mother, stepfather, and maternal grandmother\nwere resident citizens of Iran (Tr. 58-61). Applicant applied for U.S. permanent\nresidency for his mother and stepfather in 2006 (Tr. 33). More documentation is\nrequired from him before their interviews will be scheduled (Tr. 52).  Applicant\u2019s mother\nis employed as a secretary for a private electrical company in Iran (Tr. 59). Before she\nleft for Qatar, she had been employed as a social worker by a government-run hospital\nin Iran (Tr. 71). Applicant speaks with her almost weekly (Tr. 59). Applicant has a close\nrelationship with his maternal grandmother with whom he has occasional telephone\ncontact (Tr. 61-62). He usually asks his mother about his grandmother\u2019s well-being (Tr.\n62). Applicant has three maternal aunts, only one of whom lives in Iran. The others live\nin Qatar and the U.S. (Tr. 72). Applicant\u2019s stepfather works for himself in the film\nindustry in Iran where he has done children\u2019s and action movies, theater, and a\ntelevision series (Tr. 68-69). Applicant speaks with his stepfather, with whom he has \u201ca\nfather and son relationship sort of\u201d (Tr. 70), about once a month (Tr. 69). Should their\napplications for U.S. permanent residency be granted, Applicant is uncertain that his\nmother and stepfather would remain here permanently because of his father\u2019s\ninvestment in his career in Iran (Tr. 70). His parents in Iran do not own any real estate\nthere (Tr. 65).\nApplicant\u2019s father works as a dentist in the U.S. (54). He became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in late April 2004 (Ex. 1, Tr. 53). He traveled to Iran three times after\nimmigrating to the U.S.: to see Applicant in 1998, to bring Applicant to the U.S. in 1999,\nand to get married in about 2006 (Tr. 43-44, 53). Applicant\u2019s father divorced his second\nwife in about 2005 and the following year, married a native Iranian citizen in Iran (Tr.\n43). His current spouse joined him in the U.S. about six months after their marriage and\nas of February 2008 had acquired U.S. permanent residency (Tr. 44). Applicant\u2019s\npaternal grandmother has U.S. permanent residency. She splits her time between the\nU.S. and Iran and just flew back to Iran the weekend before Applicant\u2019s hearing after\nspending six months or so in the U.S. visiting her children (Tr. 54). Applicant is close to\nhis paternal grandmother (Tr. 55), although his contact with her was limited during her\nrecent visit (\u201cshe was in Florida visiting her daughter, so I didn\u2019t get to see her that much\nor at all.\u201d Tr. 56). Applicant\u2019s father also has a sister living in Iran. He contacts his sibling\nby phone once a month to two months (Tr. 54).\n*     *     *\n\n6\nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\nhistory, economic and political activities in Iran, and its relationship to the U.S., I take\nadministrative notice of the following facts:\nSince December 1979, Iran has been a theocratic Islamic republic dominated by\nShi\u2019a Muslim clergy, with ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar.\nThe U.S. severed diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980 after Iranian students\noccupied the American Embassy and took 52 Americans hostage with the support of\nAyatollah Khomeini, then the \u201cSupreme Leader\u201d of Iran. Trade with Iran is severely\nrestricted by U.S. sanctions. Iran remains vehemently anti-U.S. and anti-Israel. Current\nU.S. concerns about Iran are centered on Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and\nweapons of mass destruction, its support for and involvement in international terrorism,\nits support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process, and its dismal\nhuman rights record. Iran claims it does not seek to develop nuclear weapons, but it has\nrepeatedly failed to comply with U.N. Security Council deadlines to cease uranium\nenrichment despite imposition of numerous U.N. sanctions. The U.S. has designated\nIran as a state sponsor of terrorism. In 2006, Iran continued to play a destabilizing role\nin Iraq by providing guidance, training, and weapons to Shi\u2019a political and militant\ngroups in Iraq. Iran also maintains a high-profile role in encouraging anti-Israeli terrorist\nactivity by providing rhetorical, operational, and financial support to Lebanese Hizballah\nand Palestinian terrorist groups in their efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace\nprocess. The U.S. uses multilateral sanctions and diplomatic pressure to contain the\nthreats posed by Iran.\nIran\u2019s human rights record worsened in 2006. Abuses included severe\nrestrictions on the right of citizens to peacefully change their government; unjust\nexecutions; torture and officially sanctioned severe punishments such as death by\nstoning; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial independence and of fair public\ntrials; severe restrictions on civil liberties including speech, press, assembly,\nassociation, movement, religious practice, and privacy; extensive government\ncorruption and lack of government transparency; violence and legal and societal\ndiscrimination against women, ethnic, and religious minorities, and homosexuals;\ntrafficking in persons; and restrictions on workers\u2019 freedoms to associate, organize, and\nbargain collectively. On December 19, 2006, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a\nresolution for the fourth consecutive year expressing serious concern over Iran\u2019s human\nrights problems.\nAs of January 3, 2008, the U.S. State Department advised U.S. citizens to\ncarefully consider the risks of travel to Iran as some elements of the Iranian regime and\npopulation remain hostile to the U.S. Iran does not recognize dual citizenship. Dual\nnationals of the U.S. and Iran must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport.\nAmericans of Iranian origin are specifically cautioned that they could be targeted by\nIranian authorities and that dual nationals could be denied access to the U.S. Interests\nSection of the Swiss Embassy in Iran because they are considered by Iran to be\ncitizens solely of Iran. Recently Iranian authorities prevented a number of Iranian-\nAmerican citizen academics, journalists, and others who traveled to Iran for personal\n\n7\nreasons from leaving for several months, and in some cases detained and imprisoned\nthem on various charges, including espionage and posing a threat to national security.\nIranian security personnel may at times place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel\nrooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in\nhotel rooms may be searched.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n8\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9).\nApplicant is an Iranian citizen from birth who immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager. After\nhe acquired his U.S. citizenship in June 2005 and his U.S. passport in September 2005,\nhe continued to maintain his Iranian passport, which does not expire until July 2008. He\nused that Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran on trips to see close family members in\n2006 and 2007, as he would not be allowed entry into Iran solely on his U.S. passport\nbecause of his dual nationality (see U.S. State Department Consular Information Sheet,\ndated June 5, 2007). His active exercise of this benefit of foreign citizenship raises\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport\u201d).\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to his repeated exercise of Iranian\ncitizenship. While Applicant\u2019s foreign citizenship is based on his birth in Iran, AG \u00b6 11(a)\n(\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d)\ndoes not mitigate the risk of unverifiable travel presented by use of a foreign passport.\nApplicant is unwilling to relinquish his Iranian citizenship or surrender his Iranian\npassport as long as his mother and stepfather remain resident citizens of Iran. He\ntestified that he had no present plan to travel to Iran this year, but would renew his\nIranian passport should he decide to visit his family in Iran. While I am persuaded that\nApplicant used his Iranian passport out of necessity, the risk of him exercising a right,\nprivilege, or obligation of his Iranian citizenship in the future cannot be discounted as\nlong his mother and stepfather remain resident citizens of Iran (see Guideline B, infra).\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\n\n9\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has close bonds of affection to his mother, stepfather, and maternal\ngrandmother, who are resident citizens of Iran, a country vehemently anti-U.S. and a\nstate sponsor of terrorism. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). He also has other relatives in Iran,\nincluding a paternal grandmother (\u00b6 2.b) with U.S. permanent residency who splits her\ntime between Iran and the U.S., and an aunt, uncle and cousins whom he visited when\nin Iran. The security concerns underlying AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family\nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) are implicated because\nof his close ties to family members in Iran.\nConcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s travels to Qatar and Iran to see his mother (\u00b6\u00b6\n1.c, 2.c) are primarily covered under AG \u00b6 7(a). AG \u00b6 7(i) applies where there is\n\u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country.\u201d There is no evidence of conduct that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i)\nwith the possible exception of the use of the Iranian passport, which was a legal\nexercise of his Iranian citizenship. At the same time, it informed Iranian authorities of his\npresence in the country where he could have been detained, placed under surveillance,\nor otherwise subjected to foreign influence. The primary relevance of his foreign travel is\nthat it confirms the close relationship with his mother. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d) is difficult to satisfy, given\nthe country involved is Iran. In January 2008, the U.S. State Department warned U.S.\ncitizens, including dual national Iranian-American citizens, about the risks of traveling to\nIran. Dual nationals were advised of the risk of being targeted by, detained, or even\nharassed, by authorities without the protections afforded citizens solely of the U.S.\nIran\u2019s dismal human rights record shows it is either unwilling or unable to protect against\ninterference, coercion, or other abuses.  While Applicant\u2019s mother works as a secretary\nfor a private electric company, his stepfather is self-employed in the film industry where\nhe has worked on children\u2019s and action movies, theater productions, and a television\nseries. Applicant testified that even if his parents\u2019 immigration to the U.S. is approved,\nhis stepfather may elect to stay in Iran due to his career there. It is difficult to discount\nthe risk of undue foreign influence, especially in light of Applicant\u2019s strong bonds of\naffection toward his mother and stepfather especially. Applicant\u2019s ties to extended family\n\n10\nmembers (aunt, uncle, cousins) in Iran are not of the same degree. Applicant sees them\nwhen he is in Iran, but he has no regular contact with them. However, AG \u00b6 8(c)\n(\u201ccontact and communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there\nis little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d) does not\napply because of his extensive ties to his immediate family members that are resident\ncitizens of Iran (mother, stepfather, maternal grandmother).\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence may nonetheless be mitigated\nby deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere\nis no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d)).\nApplicant came to the U.S. as a teenager in 1999. He has since been influenced by his\npublic high school and then college peers, and by the American culture. Yet he also\nspent four to five weeks during the summers of 2000, 2001, 2003, 2006, and 2007 in\nSouthwest Asia with his mother. Applicant is unwilling to surrender his foreign passport\nif it means he cannot gain entry into Iran to see his parents. His ties to the U.S. are not\nenough to overcome the substantial risks of undue foreign influence that exist because\nof his relatives\u2019 Iranian residency and citizenship. Furthermore, Applicant is likely to\ntravel to Iran on an Iranian passport in the future where he would be subject to Iranian\nlaw and increased personal risk of being targeted.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\n\n11\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family\nmember and the interests of the U.S. There is no indication that Applicant has ever\nintentionally acted in violation of his employer\u2019s interests. Yet there is an unacceptable\nrisk of foreign preference and foreign influence because of his family ties in Iran and his\nactions to maintain those close bonds. Under the totality of the facts and circumstances\nhere, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 2,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 20, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings were\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent\nmitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings: Applicant has three alcohol-related\nincidents in his record.  In 1965 he was convicted of DUI and sentenced to pay a fine.  In 2000 he\nwas arrested and charged with DUI.  He received \u201cprobation before judgment\u201d and was placed under\na year of supervised probation.  Additionally he completed a 12-week alcohol education program.\nHe was abstinent for two years and then resumed consuming alcohol, mostly wine.  In August 2006\nhe was again convicted of DUI.  \u201cHe explained that after leaving work, he stopped for dinner at a\nrestaurant [on] his way home and had a couple of glasses of wine . . . On his way home, he felt tired\nand parked his car in the parking lot of [a] convenience store.  A police officer found him asleep\nbehind the wheel of his car with the engine running.  A subsequent test determined his blood alcohol\ncontent to be .13.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He was convicted of DUI, served 10 days in jail, and was still\nundergoing a period of unsupervised probation at the time of his hearing.  He testified that he has\nan alcohol problem and has changed his lifestyle to correct it.\nIn deciding against Applicant under Guideline G, the Judge took into account Applicant\u2019s\nremorse over his alcohol misconduct and his changes in behavior.  However, the Judge stated that\nit is \u201cpremature to evaluate his ability to adhere to his stated sobriety plan, or to gauge his potential\nfor success.  In 1965 and 2000, Applicant engaged in serious criminal behavior by driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol.  His 2006 relapse shows he has not learned from his mistakes . . .\u201d  Decision\nat 7.  As a consequence, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion\nthat it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant.\u201d  Id. at 11.  The record supports the Judge\u2019s decision, both as to the weight\naccorded to the evidence under the Guideline G mitigating conditions as well as the whole-person\nanalysis.  Applicant\u2019s ability to argue for a different interpretation of the record evidence does not\nestablish error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-03120 at 2 (App. Bd.

After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 64 years old. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1961 to 1965, and was honorably discharged with the rank of senior airman (pay grade E-4). He held a secret security clearance from 1962 to 1965 as a result of his Air Force service. He attended college from 1962 to 1964, and earned approximately 33 credit hours. Additionally, through the years he has participated extensively in courses and training related to his area of expertise. He married his wife in November 1977, and they were divorced in January 2003. He has one adult son of this marriage. After leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked for a defense contractor from 1966 to 1971. He held a security clearance at the secret level during that period.

Beach, III, Esquire \n \n \nSYNOPSIS \n \nApplicant is serving probation for his third DUI which took place in August 2006. His \nlast relapse shows he has not learned from his mistakes and casts doubts on his ability to comply \nwith the law, to follow rules and regulations, and on his reliability and judgment. He also failed \nto mitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised by his relationship with his girlfriend, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen with family ties in Russia. Clearance is denied. \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn March 14, 2006, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1).1 On \nAugust 2, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that DOHA \nadjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an \nadministrative judge for a security determination.2 On August 17, 2007, Applicant answered the \nSOR and requested a hearing.  \n \nThe case was originally assigned to another administrative judge and reassigned to me on \nOctober 22, 2007, due to caseload considerations. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October \n29, 2007, convening a hearing on November 15, 2007. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government presented five exhibits, marked GE 1-5, to support the SOR. GE \n1-4 were admitted without objection. GE 5 was considered for administrative notice purposes \nonly, over Applicant\u2019s objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented one \nwitness and three exhibits, marked AE 1-3, that were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on November 28, 2007. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations, except for SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nwhich he denied. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough \nreview of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \n \nApplicant is 64 years old. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1961 to 1965, and was \nhonorably discharged with the rank of senior airman (pay grade E-4). He held a secret security \nclearance from 1962 to 1965 as a result of his Air Force service. He attended college from 1962 \nto 1964, and earned approximately 33 credit hours. Additionally, through the years he has \nparticipated extensively in courses and training related to his area of expertise. He married his \nwife in November 1977, and they were divorced in January 2003. He has one adult son of this \nmarriage. \n \nAfter leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked for a defense contractor from 1966 to \n1971. He held a security clearance at the secret level during that period. In 1977, Applicant \nestablished his own company. He worked as a sub-contractor for a larger defense contractor. In \n                                                          \n1  Office of Personnel Management Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86. \n \n2  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as \namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992) (Directive), as amended and revised. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense \n(Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications \nand other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n3\n                                                          \n1985, his company was granted a facility security clearance, and he held access to classified \ninformation at the secret level from 1985 to 2002. His access to classified information was \nadministratively terminated when his need for access ended.  \n \nThere is no evidence to suggest, and the Government does not allege, that Applicant has \never compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. Nor does the record \nevidence show that Applicant has ever failed to follow the rules and regulations required to \nprotect classified information. \n \nIn 2005, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor as a test specialist of \ncommunications, navigation, and identification systems. He requires access to classified \ninformation to perform the full extent of his duties. During the two years he has been working for \nhis current employer, Applicant established a favorable reputation as a professional and \ndedicated employee. The vice-president of Applicant\u2019s company endorses him for his loyalty, \nprofessionalism, and his ability to manage his personal affairs (AE 1). \n \nApplicant has been involved in three alcohol related incidents. In 1965, he was found \nguilty of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He was sentenced to pay a fine. In May \n2000, Applicant drove his car while under the influence of alcohol, and was charged with DUI. \nHe was allowed a pre-trial diversion and given probation before judgment. He completed one \nyear of supervised probation (Tr. 49). Additionally, he underwent alcohol evaluation and \ncompleted a twelve week alcohol education program that included an orientation into Alcoholic \nAnonymous (AA). He successfully completed the program in October 2000. Applicant was \ndiagnosed as a non-problem drinker.3 He claimed he abstained from alcohol use for the next two \nyears and then resumed consuming alcoholic beverages, mostly wine (Tr. 50). In March 2006, he \nsubmitted a security clearance application in which he disclosed the circumstances surrounding \nhis May 2000 DUI and resulting alcohol counseling. \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant drove his car while under the influence of alcohol, and was \nconvicted of DUI. He explained that after leaving work, he stopped for dinner at a restaurant in \nhis way home and had a couple of glasses of wine with dinner. He claimed he felt okay after \ndinner and drove home. On his way home, he felt tired and parked his car in the parking lot of \nconvenience store. A police officer found him asleep behind the wheel of his car with the engine \nrunning. A subsequent test determined his blood-alcohol content to be .13.  \n \nIn December 2006, Applicant was convicted of DUI, served 10 days jail, and was placed \non two years unsupervised probation. He was still on probation at the time of his hearing. In \nOctober 2006, Applicant self-referred himself to a 26 week substance abuse counseling program, \nwhich he successfully completed. He was diagnosed as an alcohol abuser. His prognosis was \nconsidered \u201cfair\u201d based on his exceptional participation on the program. The counselors \nrecommended Applicant remain alcohol abstinent and that he continued his participation in AA.4  \n \n \n3  See letter from Help and Recovery Today, dated October 6, 2000, included in Applicant\u2019s response to \nDOHA interrogatories. \n4  Discharge summary, dated June 2007, attached to Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR. \n \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\nApplicant continues to participate in AA and intends to continue to do so in the future \n(Tr. 61). He recently received a one-year-coin for having maintained one year of sobriety (Tr. \n62). Notwithstanding, Applicant did not recognized the Serenity Prayer (Tr. 106), and testified \nhe did not have a AA sponsor. Applicant claimed he has changed his lifestyle since October \n2006. He no longer attends parties, bars, or events where alcohol is served. His live-in girlfriend \nis aware of Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems, that he is on probation, and that he is trying to remain \nsober. Although she continues to consume alcohol in his presence, she is supportive of \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to remain abstinent (Tr. 64). \n \nConcerning his history of alcohol consumption, Applicant stated he began consuming \nalcohol at age 19. In his younger days he was the skipper of a racing boat and drinking and \npartying hard was part of his lifestyle. At his hearing, he testified he recognizes he has an alcohol \nproblem and has changed his lifestyle to correct his problem. Applicant believes his alcohol \nincidents do not show his judgment is impaired. He believes his past drinking habit should not be \na security concern.  \n \nIn March 2003, Applicant met his 49-year-old living-in girlfriend (G) at a singles\u2019 \nmeeting in a restaurant. They have been living together since the summer of 2003. She considers \nApplicant an occasional drinker. She has not seen Applicant consume alcoholic beverages since \nAugust 2006 (Tr. 169). She believes Applicant feels guilty and disappointed at himself because \nof his 2006 DUI.  \n \nG is a Jewish national. She was born, raised, and educated in what is now the Russian \nFederation (Russia) (Tr. 140). Her father enlisted in the Russian Army at age 17, and retired with \nthe rank of colonel in 1971. After his retirement, her father received a government/military \npension and worked for the Russian government as a hospital administrator. He passed away in \n2005. Her 82-year-old mother is a citizen and resident of Russia. She is a retired teacher, and \nreceives her late husband\u2019s pension (Tr. 178-179).  \n \nG left Russia in 1990 with her then husband and two children (Tr. 143). They emigrated \nto Israel where she became an Israeli citizen, obtained a master\u2019s degree in education, and \nworked as a teacher. In 1998, G and her family emigrated to the United States (Tr. 145). In 2002, \nshe divorced her husband. In 2003, G became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Her 18-year-old \ndaughter, a college student in the United States, and her ex-husband also became naturalized  \nU.S. citizens. Her son is a U.S. legal resident pending naturalization. \n \nG teaches Hebrew and Judaic to children at a Synagogue, a school, and a congregation. \nShe has been trying to convince her mother to move to the United States without success (Tr. \n152). G has travelled to Russia twice since 1990, both times to see her parents. The last time was \nin 2005 when her father passed away. She has not been to Russia since 2005 and has no \nintentions of going back to Russia. During the summer of 2007, she sent her daughter and son to \nvisit her mother in Russia (Tr. 206).  \n \nG has a 54-year-old brother who is citizen and resident of Russia. G testified she had a \nbad relationship with her brother for the last 16 years. At her father\u2019s insistence, G reconciled \nwith her brother. They currently have contact three to four times a year (Tr. 159). Her brother \nserved in the Russian Army for two years. Since then, he has been working for the Russian \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n5\ngovernment. He manages all public bus transportation for a city in Russia (Tr. 166). She claimed \nto have only one friend left in Russia. She has not been able to contact her for the last six years \n(Tr. 172). Occasionally, she sends money ($50-$100) to both her mother and brother as presents \nfor birthdays and holiday celebrations. She does not provide financial support for either relative \n(Tr. 187). G averred she is a loyal U.S. citizen with personal and professional commitments in \nthe United States. She stated having no ties or loyalty toward Russia or Israel. \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Russia is a federation made up of 21 \nrepublics. Its government has a poor human rights record and it is plagued with corruption, \nmedia suppression, politically motivated crimes, and human rights violations. Russia has a \nsignificant intelligence capability that it retained from the Soviet Union. Russia\u2019s intelligence \nefforts continue to increase in sophistication, scope, and number. It has an aggressive industrial \nespionage and intelligence collection program targeting sensitive and protected U.S. technology. \nRussia\u2019s government sells to other countries technology with application for weapons of mass \ndestruction (nuclear and biotechnology) and missiles. It has provided technology and support to \nChina, Venezuela, India, and Iran against U.S. wishes. \n \n \n \nPOLICIES \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances \nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The \npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a \nconclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial \ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,5 and the whole \nperson concept.6 Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) are the applicable relevant \nadjudicative guidelines. \n \n \nBURDEN OF PROOF \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.7 The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial \n                                                          \n5  Directive, Section 6.3. states, \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and \nadjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d \n \n6  AG \u00b6 2(a). states, \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known \nas the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d  \n \n7  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\nevidence.8 The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the \nultimate burden of persuasion.9  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling \ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.10 \n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express \nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Executive Order \n10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), the government\u2019s concern is that excessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that in 1965, 2000, \nand 2006 Applicant drove while under the influence of alcohol. He was convicted of DUI in \n1965 and 2006. In 2000, he received probation before judgment. Applicant excessive alcohol \nconsumption resulted in his exercising questionable judgment. Additionally, he was diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser in June 2006. Guideline G disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related \nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence . . ., and  AG \u00b6 22(e): \nevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a license clinical social worker who is \nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program, apply.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been involved in any alcohol-related misconduct \nsince August 2006. Applicant stopped consuming alcohol in October 2006, and has remained \nabstinent since. His company\u2019s vice-president statement shows Applicant\u2019s work behavior for \nthe last two years has not been indicative of his having an alcohol problem. He is considered a \nvaluable employee, who is loyal, reliable, dependable, and professional. His girlfriend \ncorroborated he has abstained from alcohol since October 2006. Furthermore, Applicant received \n                                                          \n8  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial evidence is \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the \ncontrary evidence in the record.); ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is \nmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence.). \n \n9  Egan, supra n. 7, at 528, 531. \n \n10  See id; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n7\na \u201cfair\u201d prognosis after he completed his 2006 alcohol counseling. At his hearing, Applicant \nacknowledged his issues of alcohol abuse, demonstrated remorse, and promised to continue his \nlifestyle changes and to remain abstinent. \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established \na pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol \nabuser);  \n \n \n(c): the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling or \ntreatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and is \nmaking satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d): the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling \nor rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics \nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a \nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n  \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find Guideline G mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s most recent DUI is temporally recent, and he \nhas not completed his probation. Although Applicant is remorseful for his behavior and has \ninitiated changes in his lifestyle, it would be premature to evaluate his ability to adhere to his \nstated sobriety plan, or to gauge his potential for success. In 1965 and 2000, Applicant engaged \nin serious criminal behavior by driving under the influence of alcohol. His 2006 relapse shows he \nhas not learned from his mistakes and cast doubts on his ability to comply with the law and \nfollow rules and regulations. The fact that Applicant did not recognized the Serenity Prayer and \nstated not having an AA sponsor create doubts as to his progress within the AA program and his \nrehabilitation. Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and rehabilitation would be \nbetter evaluated after he serves his two year probation.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23(c) partially applies because he is participating in counseling and seems to be \ndoing well. However, Applicant received counseling after his 2000 DUI and that did not prevent \nhis 2006 DUI relapse. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and (d) fully apply. On balance, however, not enough time \nhas passed since Applicant\u2019s last DUI for his favorable information to show it is unlikely his \nquestionable behavior will not recur.  \n \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n8\n  \nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that foreign contacts \nand interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial \ninterests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, \nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of \nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States \ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in \nthis case, including: \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information; * * *, and  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nApplicant has a close, intimate relationship with his live-in girlfriend. Because of the \ncloseness of their relationship, G\u2019s relatives in Russia and her frequent contact with those \nrelatives are sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in \nthe compromise of classified information. These contacts create a substantial risk of foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation because there is the possibility that Russian agents may \nexploit the opportunity to obtain intelligence, classified, or economic information about the \nUnited States. His relationship with G is sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his \ndesire to help G, or to help G help her relatives or the government of Russia by providing \nsensitive or classified information.  \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n  \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n9\n                                                          \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply. The evidence shows Applicant has strong \nfeelings of affection for G. She, on the other hand, has a strong feelings and sense of obligation \nto her mother, and to a lesser extent to her brother and friend in Russia. The closeness of his \nrelationships with G is shown by Applicant living with G and asking her to marry him. G has \nfrequent contacts with her mother and occasional contact with her brother. She sends them \npresents for birthday and special occasions, and in 2007, G sent her two children to visit her \nrelatives in Russia.  \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, I \nconsidered Russia\u2019s form of government.11 Russia\u2019s government has a poor human rights record \nand it is plagued with corruption and politically motivated crimes. It has a significant intelligence \ncapability that it retained from the Soviet Union with an aggressive industrial espionage and \nintelligence collection program targeting sensitive and protected U.S. technology. Russia\u2019s \ngovernment provides other countries with technology and support against U.S. wishes. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, Applicant did not establish it is unlikely he \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his girlfriend or her \nfamily and the interests of the United States. There is also an enhanced risk of potential \nexploitation or influence because of her late father\u2019s and brother\u2019s service in the Russian Army. \nApplicant did not meet his burden of showing there is little likelihood that his relationship with \nG and G\u2019s relationship with her family could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant is a native born U.S. citizen with a strong \nrelationship and loyalty to the United States. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States\u2019 interest. Although this mitigating condition is partially \napplicable, these facts are insufficient to overcome the security concerns. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not \napply because G\u2019s contact with her mother and brother is not casual or infrequent. \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed \npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person \nconcept under AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not \nconsider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the \nJudge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an \n \n \n11  The focus is not the country or its people. The focus of the analysis is on its rulers and the nature of the \ngovernment they impose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the \nlevel of security concern or threat it presents to the United States.  \n \n\n \ns                                                                                                                                          \n \n10\napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d12 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors \n(factors) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Additionally, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered \nin reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall \ncommon sense determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(c).     \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony shows Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. There is no evidence he \nhas ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes pride \non his years of military service, and his almost 35 years of working as a civilian on government \nrelated contracts. \n \nConsidering the totality of the facts and circumstances, including his military service, \neducation, business success, and years of diligent service as a civilian employee, on balance his \ninformation is not sufficient to mitigate the alcohol consumption and foreign influence security \nconcerns. \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err \non the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d13 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns.  \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.f \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 1.b  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer requesting a hearing on December 14, 2007.\nI received the case assignment on January 15, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non February 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 5, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, I received four government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony.\nApril 15, 2008\n\n2\nI received the transcript on March 19, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old man who was recently married in August 2007. He has\nno children. He has a high school education. For the past four years he has worked as\nan installation technician. He primarily helps build radar systems (Exhibit 2).\nAs of June 2007, Applicant had more than $60,000 of delinquent debts. He\naccrued most of it in 1996 after a business venture, a jewelry store, failed (Tr. 22).\nShortly after opening the store, Applicant became quickly overwhelmed with the\nmanagement of the business and began using credit cards to pay business expenses.\nThe business failed after nine months. Although Applicant had a business partner, he\nfailed to structure the partnership accordingly. Also, all of the credit cards were in his\nname. Consequently, after the business failed, he had no legal recourse when his\npartner refused to pay her share of the expenses. \nApplicant has approximately $30,000 in a 401(k) savings plan. Over the years,\nhe has borrowed money from it on two occasions to satisfy approximately $6,000 of \ndelinquencies unlisted in the SOR (Tr. 33). The loans remain unpaid. He has satisfied\nthe delinquencies listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a (Exhibit A) and 1.b (Tr. 19). These\ncollectively equal approximately $500 and do not relate to the failed business. \nThe remaining delinquencies are unpaid. In December 2007, Applicant began\nresearching debt counseling companies. He chose one in February 2008 (Tr. 38). The\nchoice was delayed because his wife underwent back surgery in December 2007, and\ndid not return to work until the following February.\nIn January 2008, Applicant sold a rental property in an attempt to generate\nincome to use toward debt reduction (Tr. 32). He was unable, however, to generate a\nprofit from the transaction.\nApplicant took vacations each year between 2005 and 2007. On the most recent\ntrip, his honeymoon, he spent approximately $4,000. He used money from his tax\nreturns to finance the trips. (Tr. 36).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s longstanding financial delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations, and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may\nbe indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nAll of his delinquencies, except two small utility bills listed in SOR subparagraphs\n1.a and 1.b, resulted from a 1996 failed business. Since 2005, Applicant has satisfied\nthe utility bills, and approximately $6,000 of delinquencies not listed in the SOR. In the\npast three months, he attempted to generate income by selling an investment property,\nhe has researched several debt counseling firms, and has recently chosen one. AG \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d applies.\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions and conclude none apply.\nApplicant\u2019s business failed nearly 12 years ago and the majority of his business-related\ndelinquencies still remain outstanding. Although he satisfied $6,000 of his\ndelinquencies, he did so by borrowing money on two occasions from his 401(k). Both\nloans are still outstanding. He has retained a debt counselor, but has not yet developed\n\n4\na payment plan. Also, between 2005 and 2007 he spent thousands of dollars on yearly\nvacations rather than on reducing his delinquencies. Applicant has not mitigated the\nfinancial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nEvaluating this case in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems remain a security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (the\nRegulation); Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR answer on November 8, 2007.

I received the\nMarch 6, 2008\n\nSOR subparagraph 1.a alleges that one of Applicant\u2019s credit card debts became delinquent in June 2001.\n1\nApplicant provided e-mail documentation from the creditor stating that the debt did not become delinquent until\nDecember 2003 (E-Mail from Creditor to Applicant, dated July 17, 2006, as listed in Answer at 3). I find the\ndebt became delinquent in December 2003.\n2\ncase assignment on December 6, 2007.

During the\nhearing, I received five Government exhibits, five Applicant exhibits, and the testimony\nof two Applicant witnesses. At the close of the hearing, the record was left open at\nApplicant\u2019s request to allow him to submit additional documents. Within the time\nallotted, he submitted one additional exhibit that I incorporated into the record. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2008. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information\nis granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old married man with one child age 10. He has a bachelor\nof science degree in computer system management, and is working on a master\u2019s\ndegree in the same field. He served in the Army National Guard from 1990 to 1994\nbefore transferring to the Army where he served from 1994 to 1997 (Tr. 19).\nApplicant is an information technology specialist whose duties include updating\nhis company\u2019s web technology, and maintaining its computer information systems.

Under the rental agreement,\nthe tenant purchased the option of buying the property (Exhibit B).\n\n3\nWithin a week of executing the rental agreement with the tenant, Applicant\nmoved into the home he had purchased in State 2 (Tr. 22). In September 2006,\nApplicant and his wife discovered a rental property in the same city that was closer to\ntheir son\u2019s elementary school, and chose to move into it (Tr. 37). They located a buyer\nfor the home they were vacating, and settlement was scheduled for December 2006 (Tr.\n38). The buyer withdrew from the deal. They then rented the house to a tenant in March\n2007 (Tr. 38).\nBetween September 2006 and March 2007, Applicant had to pay both the rent on\nthe new home where he had moved and the mortgage on the home from which he had\nmoved. Because the property was vacant, he received no rental income to offset the\nmortgage cost. His credit card delinquencies from the failed 2003 real estate investment\nremained outstanding (SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b). He fell behind on his\nmortgage payment on the State 1 rental property (SOR subparagraph 1.c), the State 2\nrental property (SOR subparagraph 1.d), and a student loan (SOR subparagraph 1.e).\nBy March 2007, these delinquencies collectively totalled approximately $55,000\n(Answer).\nIn April 2007, Applicant obtained a deferment on his student loan payments\n(Exhibit C). He must resume them in April 2008 (Exhibit 5 at 2). The monthly payments\nwill be $101 per month (Id.). In the last six months, he has caught up on the delinquent\nmortgage payments (Exhibit 5 at 3).\nThe delinquent debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b remain\noutstanding, and total approximately $60,000 (Exhibit 5 at 2). The respective creditors\nassigned these debts to the same collection agent. Applicant attempted to negotiate a\nsettlement of these debts, but was unsuccessful.\nRecently, the tenant residing in the State 1 property exercised the option to\npurchase the property. His financing has been approved, and the parties anticipate\nsettlement to be scheduled some time over the next two weeks (Tr. 40). The property\u2019s\npurchase price is $128,000 (Exhibit B). Applicant owes the mortgagor $80,000. After\nsettlement, he intends to apply the net capital gain to the remaining delinquencies (Tr.\n40).\nApplicant makes $62,000 per year, and his wife makes $20,000. For seven years\nbefore moving to State 2, she did not work. She had quit working to care for her\ndisabled mother, and their financial struggles were perpetuated in part, by this loss of\nincome (Exhibit 2 at 3). They have approximately $4,100 in retirement savings (Exhibit\nE).\nApplicant omitted financial information on his application for public trust positions\ncompleted in 2006. He thought he did not need to list debts that had been charged off.\nSix months after completing the application, he met with an investigator, and\nvolunteered the financial information (Exhibit 2 at 3).\n\n4\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented\nSeptember 1, 2006, apply to ADP trustworthiness determinations. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, they are divided into those that may be\nconsidered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information or eligibility for access to sensitive information (disqualifying\nconditions), and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility for access to\nsensitive information (mitigating conditions).\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, [or] trustworthiness . . .\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds\u201d (Id.).\nHere, Applicant\u2019s financial problems trigger the applicability of AG & 19(a), \u201can\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial\nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b619(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by a failed 2003 real estate\ninvestment. They were exacerbated in 2006 when he moved and was unable to sell his\nformer residence for six months. When the situation with his real estate holdings\n\n5\nstabilized, he began catching up on his delinquent debt. He is now current on the\nmortgage payments listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d, and he got the student\nloan, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e, out of delinquent status by obtaining a\ndeferral. His efforts at negotiating a favorable settlement with the collection agent for the\ncreditors whose charge cards he used to pay for the 2003 investment property repairs\nwere unsuccessful. However, he is in the process of selling his State 1 property, and\nintends to apply the proceeds to these delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20 (b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), applies. \nThese steps constitute clear indications that Applicant is actively trying to resolve\nhis financial delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201c. . .there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified [and\nsensitive] information\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Here, Applicant\u2019s omissions from his public trust\nposition application raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies. I conclude\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for the omission was credible. The omission was not intentional,\nand AG \u00b6 16(a) does not pose any concern regarding whether he should have access to\nsensitive information.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall commonsense judgment\nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent financial indebtedness was not caused by extravagant\nspending. Instead, it was caused by a failed real estate investment, and perpetuated\nwhen he was forced for six months to absorb the mortgage expense on a home, from\nwhich he had moved, as he struggled to sell it a second time after the first buyer\nwithdrew a purchase offer. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 decision to move three months after relocating to State 2 was\nquestionable in light of the earlier problem he had with real estate in 2003. This concern\nis outweighed by the steps he has taken since 2006, as described in the Financial\nConsiderations section, to resolve his financial problems. Moreover, Applicant, in\ndescribing his finances in an organized manner at the hearing, demonstrated a firm\nunderstanding of them. Upon evaluating these variables in addition to Applicant\u2019s stellar\nwork performance, I am confident that he will resolve these problems as planned, and\nthat they will not recur. I conclude that he has mitigated the government\u2019s concern\nregarding his eligibility to occupy a sensitive position.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to\nsensitive information. Eligibility is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nFebruary 29, 2008\n\n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on August 17, 2007, detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline C, foreign preference, and Guideline B, foreign influence for Applicant.\n \nOn August 29, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. On October 2, 2007, I was assigned the case. On\nOctober 17, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing for a hearing held on November 15,\n2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into\nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through B,\nwhich were admitted into evidence. On November 27, 2007, DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Lebanon and South Korea. The request and the attached\ndocuments were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing\nExhibits (HEx) I)XXVIII. Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that the facts administratively\nnoticed must be limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to\nreasonable dispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of\nFact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a of the\nSOR. He admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.c, and 2.d of the SOR, with\nexplanations.

(Tr. 57) \nIn 1993, Applicant used his U.S. passport to travel to Lebanon. His first U.S.\npassport expired in November 2003, which he renewed in December 2003 and which\nwill expire in December 2013. In June and July 2003, Applicant was in Lebanon for two\nweeks so his children could learn about the country and language. While there, they\nstayed in a hotel. On this trip, Applicant took his Lebanese passport, which had expired\nin 1991, for identification purposes. (Tr. 23, 25, Ex. A) For security reasons Applicant\nused his expired Lebanese passport to enter Lebanon. Individuals using U.S. passports\nwere at a higher risk of disappearing, being kidnapped, or killed. (Tr. 23) Applicant did\nnot need a Lebanese passport to leave Lebanon, a birth certificate was sufficient. (Ex. 2\nAttachment E and F, Tr. 23) He used his U.S. passport to leave the country. (Tr. 24) For\nall travel, except to Lebanon, Applicant used his U.S. passport. (Tr. 22) Applicant\nsurrendered his expired Lebanese passport at the hearing by making it an Applicant\u2019s\nexhibit A.\nApplicant has five sisters who are dual citizens of Lebanon and the U.S. His\nsisters have all lived in the U.S., each living here long enough to meet the five-year\nrequirement for citizenship. (Tr. 54) He has a brother living in the U.S. who became a\nU.S. citizen in 2001 (Tr. 48) He has another brother living in the U.S. (Ex 1, Tr. 49) He\nhas contact with his sisters two or three times a year by telephone and every three\nyears or so when they visit him in the U.S. (Ex. 3) The summer of 2007, was the last\ntime he saw any of his sisters.

They have two daughters living in the U.S. None of his relatives\nor their spouses are currently employed by a foreign government or are involved in\npolitics. (Tr. 52, 81) \nIn November 2001, Applicant was assigned by his company to work in Korea\nproviding technical support. (Ex. B) He lived in Korea for three and a half years. (Ex. 2)\nHis first assignment to Korea was for a year and a half. The second was for two years.\n(Tr. 33) While there he met and became friends with an individual who owned a jet ski.\n(Ex. B) When Applicant returned to the U.S., his friend would periodically ) three or four\ntimes a year (Tr. 37) ) ask Applicant if he could find parts, new or used, for the jet ski.\nApplicant would check with local stores or his Korean friend would go onto eBay and\npurchase parts. The eBay purchases would be sent to Applicant in the U.S. who would\nthen ship them to Korea. (Ex. B, Tr. 35) Applicant\u2019s Korean friend would pay Applicant\n\n4\nthe cost of the goods and shipping fees or, in the case of eBay purchases, would pay\nthe sellers directly. (Ex 2) Applicant received no profit from the transactions. (Tr. 78) \nIn December 2006, Applicant put his friend in touch with a jet ski dealership in\nCalifornia. Since that time, his friend purchases all of his jet ski equipment needs\nthrough the dealership. (Tr. 43) Since then, Applicant has not purchased or sent goods\nto Korea.\nApplicant\u2019s Korean friend wire transferred Applicant $5,365 to purchase a jet ski,\nhowever the jet ski was in poor condition, and Applicant returned the money. (Tr. 42) In\nJuly 2004, Applicant visited his friend in Korea for approximately one week. Applicant\nwas in Korea pursuant to his duties with his company. (Tr. 72) He spent another week in\nSeptember 2006 visiting his friend in Korea. \nIn the early 1990s, Applicant was approached by a Lebanese individual and\nasked about aircraft blueprints. (Tr. 60) The following day, Applicant went to the\ncompany security office to notify them about being approached and the FBI was\ncontacted. \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. Lebanon is a nominal\ndemocracy with a less-than-perfect human rights record. It has both a long history of\ncivil war and of foreign influence by Syria. Lebanon is not a state sponsor of terrorism,\nbut is a permissive environment for groups recognized by the U.S. as terrorist\norganizations, which Lebanon considers \"freedom fighters\" against Israel. The U.S.\nState Department continues to maintain a travel warning for U.S. citizens contemplating\ntravel to Lebanon. Lebanon is not known to be a collector of intelligence or economic\ninformation against the U.S. \nThe Republic of Korea (ROK) is a stable, mature, democratic republic, a strong\nmilitary ally and friend of the U.S., and a major U.S. trading partner. (U.S. Dept. of\nState, Background Note: South Korea at 3 (Apr. 2006), incorporated in the record as\nHearing Exhibit (HEx) XIII; speech of U.S. Ambassador to the ROK, March, 2006,\nincorporated as HEx XVI.) The U.S. and the ROK have differed on various issues, some\ninvolving the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (North Korea). (Congressional\nResearch Service, Korea: U.S.-Korean Relations\u2013Issues for Congress at CRS 10 (June\n2005), incorporated in the record as HX XVII.) The U.S. policy is that the question of\npeace and security on the Korean Peninsula is a matter for the Korean people to\ndecide. The U.S. and the ROK cooperate in trade, academic and cultural exchanges,\nscience and technology, joint efforts to combat terrorism, and people-to-people\nexchanges. The ROK has a good human rights record, although it has taken some\nstrong measures against violent labor, political, and student demonstrations. North\nKorean agents have sought to exploit ROK dissidents to undermine the ROK\ngovernment. Crime is generally low in the ROK. \nThe U.S., because of its supremacy in industrial power, remains a prime target of\nforeign economic collection and industrial espionage. Due to the race to control scarce\n\n5\nresources and the global markets, economic intelligence against the U.S., including the\ntheft of trade secrets and competitive business information is likely to increase.\nTraditional allies as well as adversaries have increased their collection efforts against\nU.S. targets and will continue to do in the future. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nForeign Preference\nForeign Preference is a security concern when an individual acts in such a way\nas to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States. AG & 9. Additionally, the possession or use of a foreign passport is\na condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. AG & 10(a) (1)\nApplicant did have an expired Lebanese passport, which he used for identification when\nentering Lebanon. I find AG 10(a) applies. \nApplicant used his expired Lebanese passport as a form of identification and not\nas a passport to enter Lebanon.  The Lebanese passport had been expired for 12 years\nwhen used for identification. He has a birth certificate which provides identification and\nno longer needs his expired Lebanese passport. Applicant no longer has possession of\nthe expired passport having chose to make it an exhibit and part of the permanent\nrecord.\nAG & 11(e) sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns if the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated. First, the passport was not \u201cvalid.\u201d It had been expired for 12\nyears. Second, the passport was surrendered and made an exhibit at the hearing. This\ndoes not fit the exact wording of 11 (e) because the passport may not have been\nsurrendered to a \u201ccognizant security authority,\u201d but it is beyond Applicant\u2019s control to the\nsame extent as if one of the named events had occurred. Applicant does not have\ncontrol of the passport and can not get control. \nForeign Influence \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests,\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens\nto obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG & 6\nI have considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions. Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying are listed under AG & 7.\nAG & 7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\n\n7\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion and AG & 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information, apply.\nIn 1979, Applicant moved to the U.S. He obtained bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982 and\nhis master degree in 1984. In 1984, more than 23 years ago, he became a U.S. citizen.\nHis wife, a doctor, and two children are U.S. citizens. In 2005, Applicant\u2019s joint income\nwith his wife was $225,000. He has no foreign assets and his U.S. assets are\napproximately $600,000. Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and few ties to\nLebanon and none to South Korea. He has no financial or business interests in\nLebanon or South Korea.\nApplicant\u2019s five sisters reside in Lebanon. He has contact with his sisters two or\nthree times a year by telephone and every three years or so when they visit him in the\nU.S. The summer of 2007 was the last time he saw any of his sisters. None of his\nsisters or their spouses have connections with any foreign government. While danger\ncertainly exists for all who reside in Lebanon, Applicant and his sisters are in no greater\ndanger than any other individual living and working there. \nApplicant stated he was loyal to the U.S. and would do nothing to compromise\nU.S. interests. Generally, an Applicant\u2019s statements, by themselves, as to what he\nwould do in the face of threats by a foreign government or entity are entitled to little\nweight. However, Applicant\u2019s proven record of action is very important. When asked to\nsupply blueprints, Applicant immediately contacted his security office and the FBI.\nShould pressure be brought to bear against his sisters in Lebanon, Applicant\u2019s reaction\nwill most likely be the same: to immediately inform his security office. His sense of\nloyalty is exclusively to the U.S. \n\u00b6 8(a) \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d and \u00b6 8(b) \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual=s sense of loyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s sisters. \nWhen working in South Korea, Applicant became friends with a South Korean\ncitizen. When Applicant returned to the U.S., Applicant assisted his friend on a few\noccasions to get parts for his friend\u2019s jet ski. Sometimes parts were purchased on eBay\nand sent to Applicant who would send them to South Korea. Sometimes Applicant\u2019s\nfriend made direct payment to the seller and other times Applicant would pay and be\nreimbursed for the cost. \n\n8\nSince December 2006, Applicant has not purchased or sent goods to Korea.\nApplicant\u2019s friend now purchases equipment through a jet ski dealership in California.\nApplicant\u2019s actions were favors to a friend and were not a business. Applicant traveled\nto South Korea on company business and once for a one week vacation. \nAs to Applicant\u2019s South Korean friend, both \u00b6 8(a) and \u00b6 8(b) apply as does \u00b6\n8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d\nThere is nothing in Applicant getting parts for his friend\u2019s jet ski that rises to a security\nconcern. \nThere is little likelihood Applicant has any conflict of interest, but if he did it is\nclear, due to his longstanding loyalty to the U.S. and the likely minimal nature of the\nconflict; he would resolve it in favor of the U.S. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Lebanon. In\n1974, he was sent to Europe for school at age 14. Five years later he moved to the U.S.\nto attend college. In 1984, at age 24, he became a U.S. citizen, and his wife and\nimmediate family are now here. He is an established, highly regarded engineer, with\nconsiderable U.S. ties and assets. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Lebanon and the heavy\nburden an Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country. His\nsister\u2019s jobs and that of their spouses are not connected to any foreign government.\nMost of his sister\u2019s children live in the U.S. These facts minimize any potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant was sincere, open, and honest at\nthe hearing. In the unlikely event that his sister\u2019s were subjected to coercion or duress\nfrom terrorist groups, I find that with Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties to the U.S., including his uncompromising commitment to his country, wife,\n\n9\nand children, Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress in favor of the U.S.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign preference and foreign influence security\nconcerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n_________________\nCLAUDE R. HEINY II\nAdministrative Judge\n",

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBertha McMillian, Personal Representative\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant owes approximately $35,790 in taxes, penalties and interest to the Internal\nRevenue Service for tax years 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. He has retained a certified public\naccountant to assist him in obtaining a settlement of the tax liabilities with the federal government.\nOnce a settlement is reached, his older sister is willing to pay the tax debt for him. An offer in\ncompromise was submitted to the Internal Revenue Service only two weeks prior to the hearing. The\nstatus of negotiations with the Internal Revenue Service is uncertain. A promise to pay in the future\nis not sufficient to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2,1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\n Gov 1.\n2\n Tr. at 38; AE M. \n3\n Tr. at 12.\n4\n Tr. at 33.\n5\n2\nOn July 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nIn a sworn statement, dated September 3, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on\nOctober 2, 2007. On October 4, 2007, a notice of hearing was sent scheduling the hearing for\nOctober 24, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered four exhibits which\nwere admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1-4 without objection. Applicant offered 12 exhibits\nwhich were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - L without objection. The transcript was\nreceived on November 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his SOR response, Applicant denies the overall concern under Guideline F but admits to\nthe factual allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after\na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old man employed with a Department of Defense contractor who is\napplying for a security clearance.  He is married and has three adult children from a previous\n2\nmarriage. He has three children with his current wife, whom he married in August 2002 a step-\ndaughter, age 7, and two daughters ages 4 and five months.  He has been employed as a switch\n3\ntechnician with his current company since October 2006.  He has worked as a contractor on a\nmilitary base over the last 17 years.  \n4\nIn the early 1990s, Applicant divorced his first wife.  He underwent several years of\ninstability. During this time he did not file his taxes, although he was aware of the requirement to\nfile tax returns.  He cashed in a profit-sharing plan in 1996 in order to purchase a home but did not\n5\npay taxes on it. As a result, a tax lien was filed against Applicant on February 7, 2005.  Applicant\nowes approximately $35,790 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 1991, 1996, 1998,\n\n Tr. at 26,28, 33, 38; Gov 4. \n6\n Tr. at 29-30.\n7\n Gov 1. \n8\n Tr. at 26; Gov 2 at 2.\n9\n Tr. at 29. \n10\n AE A; AE B; Tr. at 31. \n11\n Tr. at 39-40. \n12\n Tr. at 45-48. \n13\n Tr. at 26, 44. \n14\n Tr. at 40. \n15\n Tr. at 36; Gov 2 at 4.\n16\n3\n1999 and 2000.   No payments have been made towards the tax debt aside from the IRS keeping\n6\nApplicant's tax refunds and applying the refunds towards his tax debt.7\nOn October 17, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP). In response to question 27(b), he listed his tax lien. He indicated that he hired\na tax firm to work on the tax lien.  \n8\nApplicant first became aware of his tax issues about three or four years ago after being\ncontacted by the IRS.   He attempted to resolve the debt after he was contacted by the IRS regrading\n9\nthe delinquent tax debt. He claims that he submitted offers in compromise individually but the offers\nwere rejected by the IRS.  In 2005, he retained a CPA firm to assist him with settling the tax debt.\n10\n11\nIt is unclear, what contact, if any, the CPA firm had with the IRS. Applicant informed his CPA\napproximately two weeks prior to the hearing that he wanted to submit an offer in compromise. He\ndoes not know the amount of the initial offer. His CPA will notify him once he prepares the offer\nin compromise.12\nApplicant's sister testified that once Applicant and the IRS reach a settlement, she is going\nto pay the tax debt for him.  She is not treating the payment as a loan.  She wants to help her brother\nbecause he has struggled through the years. She has the assets to pay the tax debt.13\nApplicant testified that his wife helped him straighten out his tax problems and has helped\nhim resolve his financial difficulties.  Since 2001, he has filed and paid his taxes.  \n14\nApplicant had no breaks in employment over the past 17 years.  He and his wife have a net\n15\nmonthly income of $5,800. The total monthly expenses are $2,791. The total monthly debt payments\nare $1,055.  This leaves a current monthly remainder of $1,954.   Applicant testified that the net\n16\n\n Tr. at 36-37.\n17\n AE C-J.\n18\n AE K. \n19\n AE L.\n20\n Department of the Navy v.

His annual performance appraisal\n18\nissued in October 2007 gives an overall rating of \"exceptional\" which is the highest rating an\nemployee can receive.  He successfully completed several training sessions in furtherance of his\n19\ncareer and received numerous certificates of achievement for his work performance.20\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n21\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006,\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one's\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.22\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, is set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\n Revised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(a). \n23\n Id.\n24\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\n Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\nRevised AG, dated August 2006, \u00b6 2(b).\n27\n5\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d   An administrative\n23\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n24\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n25\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.26\n\u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n27\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\n\n6\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nApplicant's tax debt owed to the Internal Revenue Service raises a security concern. He owes\napproximately $35,790 for delinquent income taxes for tax years 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000.\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant's\ncase.  He has owed these tax debts for a long time. Applicant has the means to pay his taxes but chose\nnot to. He was employed full-time during the time that he failed to file tax returns and pay his income\ntaxes.  His conduct demonstrates an unwillingness to pay his taxes as opposed to an inability to do\nso. \nFC DC \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the\nfraudulent filing of the same) applies. Applicant admits that he intentionally did not file his income\ntax returns for tax years, 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000. \nThe concern under Financial Considerations can be mitigated. Applicant  has a history of\nfinancial irresponsibility pertaining to his federal income tax returns spanning several years. His\nfederal tax debt remains unresolved.  Therefore, I cannot apply Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) \u00b6 20 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant owes the IRS for delinquent income\ntaxes over five tax years. The debts were incurred as a result of Applicant failing to file his tax\nreturns. Aside from the IRS applying Applicant's income tax refunds to the tax debt, no other\npayments have been made towards the tax debt. None of the tax debts are resolved so the problem\nremains. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or\na death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does\nnot apply.  Applicant has been continuously employed for the past 17 years. He admits that he was\nirresponsible when it came to filing and paying his federal income taxes. Although he retained an\naccounting firm to represent him in resolving his tax debt, he did not authorize his accountant to\nsubmit an offer in compromise to the IRS until two weeks prior to the hearing. Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that he has taken proactive steps to resolve these tax debts considering the age of the\ntax debts. I cannot conclude that there were recent conditions beyond Applicant's control which\ncontributed to his financial situation.  FC MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) does not apply.\nApplicant has not received financial counseling. It is too soon to conclude that the tax problem is\nresolved or under control. At the close of the record, an offer in compromise had not been submitted\nto the IRS. Although his sister states that she will pay the tax debt for him once an offer in\ncompromise is reached, a promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate the concerns raised\nunder the financial considerations concern.  It is unlikely that Applicant's tax debt will be resolved\nin the near future.\n\n7\nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) does not apply.  Although aware that he was required to file and pay taxes\nduring the tax years in question, Applicant took no steps to resolve his federal tax debt until the IRS\nfiled a tax lien against him.  While he has retained an accounting firm for the past two years to assist\nwith the tax debt,  no steps have been taken to resolve the taxes owed. Given the age of the tax debts,\nI cannot conclude that Applicant made a good faith effort to resolve the tax debts. He could have\nnegotiated a payment plan with the IRS sooner. Authorizing his accountant to submit an offer in\ncompromise two weeks prior to his security clearance hearing does not demonstrate a good faith effort\nto resolve the debt.\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties.\nIndeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness. I considered the Applicant's favorable performance report and the recommendations of\nhis friends and co-workers.  However, the tax debt remains outstanding. Considering that Applicant\ndeliberately failed to file his income tax returns for five years; he did not attempt to resolve the tax\ndebts until several years later after the IRS contacted him; and the resolution of the tax debt at the\nclose of the record is uncertain; he has not met his burden to mitigate the concerns raised under\nfinancial considerations. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRita C. O\u2019Brien, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a project coordinator for a defense contractor.  She has delinquent debts from\ncredit cards and department stores that she has not paid.  She was unemployment at times, and family\nissues affected her finances.  However, she has been steadily employed since 2003.  She has not\ntaken any steps to pay or resolve her delinquent debts.  She failed to mitigate security concerns for\nfinancial considerations.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 06, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\n\nItem 6.\n1\nItem 6, Response to FORM, dated November 13, 2007.\n2\n2\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 17, 2007.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 17, 2007.  She admitted the 21\nfinancial allegations under Guideline F noting that one account was now current.  She elected to have\nthe matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on October 29, 2007.\nApplicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on November 6, 2007, and was\nprovided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions.  She responded on November 13, 2007, providing additional information\non her finances.  On November 20, 2007, Department Counsel noted that there was no objection to\nconsideration of the addition information provided by Applicant.  The case was assigned to me on\nNovember 26, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nI thoroughly and carefully reviewed the case file and the pleadings.  I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old project coordinator for a defense contractor.  She submitted a\nsecurity clearance application on August 16, 2006.  Subsequent investigation shows she has\ndelinquent debts from as early as 2002.   \n1\nApplicant and her first husband divorced in 1988, and Applicant became a single mother\nraising two children.  She was able to send both of her children to college, even though she did not\nreceive child support from the children\u2019s father.  Applicant remarried in 2001.  When she remarried,\nher husband was employed in the airline industry in New York, and Applicant worked for an\nelectrical contractor at the World Trade Center.  After the events of September 2001, Applicant lost\nher job, and her husband transferred to another area because of the airline industry downturn.\nApplicant returned to school and received training in computer systems.  Applicant moved to join\nher husband at his location.  However, her income was substantially less than what she was earning\nin New York.  Applicant\u2019s husband was required to move twice more as the airline industry adjusted.\nApplicant did not move necessitating that the family establish two households.   \n2\nApplicant was unemployed for over 14 months in 2002 and 2003, and for over four months\nin 2005.  Applicant took vacations to Mexico in 2002 and 2003.  However since her husband is an\n\nId.\n3\nSee, Items 5, 8, and 9.\n4\nCredit reports list delinquent student loans.  Credit reports also show some of the student loans are in a deferred\n5\nstatus.  There are no allegations in the SOR concerning student loans.  Applicant responded to interrogators that one loan\nshe identified as a student loan was paid. See. Item 7, and the Response to FORM.  However, in the FORM, Department\nCounsel discusses delinquent student loans that have not been mitigated.  Since delinquent student loans were not alleged\nin the SOR as security concerns, they will not be discussed in this decision.  Since the bankruptcy filing in 1995 was\nlisted as a security concern, it will be discussed in this decision.\nItem 7 at 3, Item 8.\n6\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The debts total almost\n$21,000.  While admitting to one of the allegations (1.q), applicant states the account is now current.\nThe alleged debts are mainly to on-line clothing companies, department stores, and credit cards.  The\nindividual debts range from slightly in excess of $100 to over $2,000.   There are no delinquent debts\n4\nlisted in the SOR for a student loan.  Applicant also admitted she filed a bankruptcy in 1995.  There\nis no further information presented on the bankruptcy filing.  \n5\nApplicant presented no information to show payment of any SOR alleged delinquent debts.\nShe also did not present information to show payment of the one debt she states is current.  The debt\nis still listed as delinquent on her most current credit report.6\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n7\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.8\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\nto classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  The adjudicative guidelines for this case are the guidelines promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.10\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n11\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.12\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n13\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n14\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n15\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n16\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n17\nAG \u00b6 18.\n18\n5\nnational security.\u201d17\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nA security concern exists because a failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.   \n18\nThe cause of debts and action taken or not taken to pay debts are a better indicator of a person\u2019s\nreliability or trustworthiness and judgment than the amount of debt.  An individual who is financially\nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect\nclassified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an\nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  Irresponsibility towards financial\nobligations may be indicated by failure to take reasonable measures to pay or reduce debts.  A person\u2019s\nrelationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an\ninability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.  Absent evidence of strong\nextenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial\ndifficulties is in a situation of risk inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant\nis not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her\nfinancial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit reports admitted by Applicant brings the matter within\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) (Inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations).  Since Applicant\nadmits all of the alleged debts, I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.\nAppellant\u2019s answers to the SOR and the FORM raises Financial Consideration Mitigating\nConditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (The conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances).  The alleged debts are still delinquent and therefore current.\n\n6\nSince there are 20 varied delinquent debts, delinquent debt is incurred frequently.  Applicant did not\npresent any information that shows the debts were incurred under circumstances that were unusual or\nthat delinquent debt will not occur in the future.  FC MC \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  Applicant did lose\nemployment for a time in 2002-2003.  However except for a short period in 2005, she has been fully\nemployed since 2003.  Her salary was reduced but she was still employed.  Her husband was also\nemployed even though he had to relocate and the family had to maintain separate households.  These\nwork related conditions were beyond her control, but the circumstances did not create significant\nfinancial problems such that some action or payment of debts could be made.  While she was able to\ntake vacations are reduced cost, she did incur some costs that could have been applied to pay some of\nthe smaller delinquent debts.  There is no information on payment of any debts or change in life style\nbecause of reduced income.  Applicant did not present information to show she acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.  FC MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.\nFC MC \u00b6 2 (c) (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) is not applicable since there\nis no evidence presented that Applicant received any financial counseling and the financial problems\nare not under control.  FC MC 20(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) cannot be applied because Applicant presented no information\nto show  she made any attempts to pay the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR or make arrangements\nwith the creditors.  Applicant did state she would pay the debts when she and her husband were able\nto live together and maintain only one household.  An intention to pay debts in the future is not\nsufficient to establish a good-faith effort to pay the debts.  Applicant admitted the debts and took no\naction to pay or resolve them.\nBankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of paying and resolving debt.  However, the\ncircumstances leading up to the bankruptcy action and the actions of Applicant after debts are\ndischarged should be examined to determine if Applicant acted reasonably and responsibly in regard\nto her finances. The bankruptcy was filed in 1995 and there is no information about whether the debts\nwere discharged or are still current.  Since bankruptcy is a legal means of resolving debt, there is no\nsecurity concern based solely on the filing of a bankruptcy over 12 years ago.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I\nconclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.  Applicant has shown an\nirresponsible attitude toward her debts.  She presented insufficient information to explain the debts or\nmitigate the disqualifying conditions.  She has failed to carry her burden to refute, extenuate, or\nmitigate the security concern for delinquent debts.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns for financial considerations.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.u.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue access to classified information for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nThomas M.

On September 21, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 12, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had deliberately falsified his two security clearance\nquestionnaires.  On a questionnaire submitted in 1994, Applicant had deliberately failed to disclose\nthat he had used marijuana prior to 1994.  On a questionnaire submitted in 2005, Applicant had\ndeliberately failed to disclose that he had used marijuana, with varying frequency including three to\nfour times a week, from about 2000 to about July 2003.  He had also deliberately failed to disclose\nthat he had used marijuana in April 2004 and while holding a security clearance in 1994 on that latter\napplication.  Applicant had subsequently admitted to the falsifications.  However, in reaching his\nadverse clearance decision, the Judge noted that although Applicant\u2019s subsequent disclosure \u201c . . .\nmay have been forthright, it cannot be considered prompt.  While [he gave] Applicant some credit\nfor coming forward, that credit [was] diluted by several factors.\u201d  Decision at 7.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\nThe Board has examined the decision in light of the record as a whole.  Given his sustainable\nfindings, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion that it is\n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of the national security\u201d for him to have a clearance is likewise\nsustainable.

Murphy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Kathleen E. Voelker, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated security concerns pertaining to Personal and \nCriminal Conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86), on October \n6, 2005. On September 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J (Criminal Conduct). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 29, 2007. He \nanswered the SOR in writing on October 17, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on October 18, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 29, 2007, and I \nFebruary 12, 2008\n\n \n2\nreceived the case assignment on December 3, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on December 18, 2007, scheduling the case to be heard on January 16, \n2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered \nApplicant Exhibits A through I, which were received without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 30, 2007.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 17, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 \n2.a. \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old senior consultant, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since February 2005. He seeks to retain the security clearance \nhe obtained fraudulently in June 1994. Tr. 101-103, GE 4.  \n \nApplicant attended junior college from September 1986 to December 1989, \nand attended a four-year college from September 1991 to June 1996. Tr. 92. He \nwas awarded a bachelor of science degree, majoring in mechanical engineering, \nin June 1996. He has never been married and has no dependents. \n \nWhen Applicant first applied for an industrial clearance in January 1994, he \ndeliberately concealed his prior marijuana usage to 1994 by answering \u201cNo\u201d to \nQuestion: \n \n20. DRUG/ALCOHOL USE AND MENTAL HEALTH a. Have you \never tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include heroin or \ncocaine), depressant (to include quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen \n(to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or \nhashish) or any mind-altering substance (to include glue or paint); \neven one-time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by \na licensed physician? GE 3. \n \nApplicant admitted he falsified this answer in his Answer to SOR and \nreconfirmed this falsification during his testimony. His explanation for falsifying his \nresponse supra was: \n \nAgain, it was fear. When I was filling out this application, I had \nalready been inside this co-operative position for a few months now, \nand then suddenly I was filling out an application. Again, it was fear \n\u2013 at this point it was definitely not taking the process seriously, \nbecause prior to this, a security clearance was not something I was \nreally familiar with. And it was foolish, but it was also a matter of I \nwas \u2013 it was bad judgment. I was younger, and didn\u2019t understand \nwhat I was doing. It was a mistake. Tr. 77. \n\n \n3\n \nApplicant was granted a secret clearance in June 1994. GE 4. \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SF-86 for the renewal of his industrial \nclearance in October 2005, he again deliberately concealed his prior marijuana \nusage by answering \u201cNo\u201d to Sections 24a. and b. \n \nSection 24: Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity The \nfollowing questions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug activity. \nYou are required to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and \nyour failure to do so could be grounds for an adverse employment \ndecision or action against you, but neither your truthful responses \nnor information derived from your responses will be used as \nevidence against you in any subsequent criminal proceeding.  \n \na. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, \nhave you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, \nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, \nmorphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants \n(barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics \n(LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? \n \nb. Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while \nemployed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom \nofficial; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position \ndirectly and immediately affecting public safety? \n \nApplicant admitted he falsified this answer in his Answer to SOR and \nreconfirmed this falsification during his testimony. His explanation for falsifying his \nresponse infra was: \n \nMS. VOELKER: Now, I\u2019d like to call your attention to Government Exhibit 1, \nwhich is a security clearance application which was submitted by you in October \nof 2005. Do you recall completing that application? \n \nApplicant: I do. \n \nMS. VOELKER: Did you truthfully answer question A in Section 24, \nregarding illegal use of controlled substances in the previous 7 years? \n \nApplicant: I did not answer it truthfully. \n \nMS. VOELKER: What would the truthful answer have been? \n \nApplicant: That yes, I had used marijuana in the previous 7 years. \n \nMS. VOELKER: Now, as of today, when is the last time you used \nmarijuana? \n\n \n4\n \nApplicant: It was on a trip to Europe in Amsterdam in April 2004. \n \nMS. VOELKER: All right. And prior to that, when had you last used \nmarijuana? \n \nApplicant: It was almost a year earlier, in July 2003. At approximately the \ntime I left to go move in with my mom. \n \nMS. VOELKER: Okay. Prior to 2003, how frequently had you been using \nmarijuana, up until then? \n \nApplicant: It went through difference phases, you know, there was (sic) \ntimes when I would \u2013 if I had it and it was available, I would use it, you know, a \nfew times a week. There were times when I would go without it for months at a \ntime, and it\u2019s hard to recall exactly what the \u2013 which timeframes I was using and \nwas not, but you know, when I had it I was probably using it a few times a week. \nTr. 71-73. \n \nMS. VOELKER: So, in the same application that I just showed you a \nmoment ago, which is Government\u2019s Exhibit 1, did you truthfully answer question \nB in Section 24, regarding whether you\u2019d ever used illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance? \n \nApplicant: No, I did not answer that truthfully. \n \nMS. VOELKER: And why didn\u2019t you answer these questions truthfully? \n \nApplicant: I was definitely concerned about, you know, I was scared. It was \n\u2013 realizing now, where I am now, it was a big mistake to not answer this truthfully, \nbut I was scared about my job situation, I was scared about having already held a \nclearance and having used marijuana at that time. I was concerned about getting \nin trouble, you know. It was a mistake. Tr. 75-76. \n \nApplicant described his marijuana usage as beginning in the 12th grade. He \ncontinued to use marijuana in junior college and in college and intermittently until \nabout July 2003. And, as indicated above, the last time he used marijuana was \nwhile on vacation in Amsterdam in April 2004. He never received any drug \ntreatment or participated in any drug treatment program. Tr. 78-81, 91-93. \nApplicant did reveal his past drug use during his background investigation \ninterview in March 2006. Tr. 83-87, 100-101, GE 2.  \n \nThree witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. One was his former \nmanager and the remaining two witnesses were individuals who knew Applicant \non a social basis. These individuals consider Applicant an excellent employee \nand/or friend and praise his honesty and integrity. Applicant\u2019s documentary \nevidence included favorable work-related and commendatory correspondence. AE \nA through H. Applicant is a home owner and established in his community. AE I. \n\n \n5\nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with \nthe factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \n\u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \nApplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as \nto obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to \nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG & 15: \n    \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security \nclearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine \nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect \nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing, or (2) \nwhile in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that \ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States \nand may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign \nsecurity or intelligence service or other group.  \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of this disqualifying \ncondition through Applicant\u2019s admission. The burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \nFive Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable to this disqualifying condition: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts; \n \n\n \n7\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate \nadvice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or \ninstructing the individual specifically concerning the security \nclearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully \nand truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) partially applies because Applicant quit using marijuana in 2004. \nHowever, he is unable to receive full credit under this AG because the falsification of his \nsecurity clearance applications concealed drug use which in all likelihood would have \nprecluded him from being granted a clearance. What is certain, however, is the \nconcealment of Applicant\u2019s past drug use seriously undermined the security clearance \napplication process.  None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. The concealed \ninformation was relevant to a clearance decision.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications prohibited the Government from evaluating his illegal \ndrug use in a timely fashion, and at a time when such recent drug use might have raised \nsignificant security concerns. In addition, the Government detrimentally relied on \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications in granting his clearance. Once granted a clearance, Applicant \ncontinued to violate the trust the Government placed in him by using marijuana. \n \nFinally, while his disclosure of illegal drug use in March 2006 may have been \nforthright, it cannot be considered prompt. While I give Applicant some credit for coming \nforward, that credit is diluted by several factors. It is irrelevant that no Government \nrecords would have otherwise disclosed his drug use. Applicants are expected to tell the \nGovernment the truth as part of the security clearance vetting process.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nRecord evidence clearly established that Applicant intended to conceal his illegal \ndrug from the Government and effect the course of his background investigation. This \nconduct violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, whether or not he was successful in effecting the \ncourse of his investigation. However, in this case his falsifications did alter the \ninvestigation, as he was granted his clearance in 1994. \n \n \nThree Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his \nillegal drug use demonstrates lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The \nGovernment has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information \nabout an Applicant before making a clearance decision. The Government relies on \napplicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it \nis perceived to be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report \nadverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report \ninadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the \nGovernment relies on to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal \nneeds ahead of legitimate Government interests. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Falsifications are a core security \nconcern. His behavior was deliberate and not due to circumstances beyond his control. \nHis misconduct was both recent and frequent. I note Applicant\u2019s drug use began in 12th \ngrade and continued into his mid-30s. He failed to disclose his drug use by falsifying his \n1994 SF-86 in his early 20s, and compounded his first falsification by falsifying his 2005 \nSF-86 in his mid 30s. I have considered Applicant\u2019s relative youth at the time of his first \nfalsification, but that does not overcome the adverse inferences of his misconduct, \nhonesty being a core requirement for access, and not a difficult concept to understand \nor expect Applicant to comply with.  \n \nRehabilitation or behavioral changes are difficult to measure under these \ncircumstances, given the scrutiny Applicant has been under since his drug use came to \nlight. He clearly sought to mislead the Government about his drug record, or was at \nleast willing to benefit form his misconduct. Applicant\u2019s willingness to put his personal \nneeds ahead of legitimate Government interests increases his potential vulnerability and \nhe has not demonstrated that the misconduct is unlikely to recur. The concern is \nwhether Applicant would disclose situations or circumstances, whether deliberated or \ninadvertent, that raise security concerns.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and/or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the \nGovernment\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant submitted an\nundated response to the SOR which was received by DOHA on October 12, 2007.\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegation contained in subparagraph 1.a, denied the\nallegations contained in subparagraphs 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b, and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on December 3, 2007, and\nreassigned to me on January 16, 2008, for administrative reasons. A notice of hearing was\nissued on January 3, 2008, scheduling the hearing for January 24, 2008. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. The government called one witness and submitted 16\ndocumentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-16. GE 1-3 and\nGE 5-16 were admitted into the record without objection. GE 4 was admitted into the record\nwithout objection, excepting those portions of the document that are illegible. Applicant\ntestified, called two witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted nine documentary\nexhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-9. AE 1-4 and AE 6-8 were admitted\ninto the record without objection. The Government\u2019s objections to AE 5 and AE 9 were\noverruled and they were admitted into the record. The transcript was received on February\n1, 2008.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admission to the one allegation in the SOR is incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 45 years old and has been employed by defense contractors, presently\nas a project manager, since in or about May 1985. He holds a bachelor in electrical\nengineering degree and a master in engineering management degree. He was awarded\nthe master\u2019s degree in May 1990. Applicant has held a security clearance for\napproximately 20 years, including a top secret clearance since 2002. No prior adverse\naction has been taken to revoke of downgrade his security clearance eligibility.      \nApplicant has been married since July 1983. He and his wife have two children,\nages 16 and 12. Applicant has volunteered for years as a youth volleyball coach. He is\nactive in church activities, including service recently for several years as a deacon. He also\ncontributes financially to local charitable causes. Applicant submitted the testimony and\naffidavits of numerous co-workers who uniformly attest to his outstanding reputation as a\ntrustworthy, reliable, honest, and ethical individual. They consider him to be a\nconscientious employee whom they highly recommend be allowed access to classified\ninformation. \nOn March 5, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving a Vehicle While\nUnder the Influence (DUI), Driving a Vehicle While Impaired by Alcohol (DWI) and Failure\nto Obey a Properly Placed Traffic Control Device. The arrest occurred after Applicant had\nstopped for dinner and drinks with friends following a volleyball tournament in which he had\nparticipated. Applicant consumed several alcoholic beverages with his meal and had a 0.07\nblood alcohol level at the time of his arrest. That level is below the level at which the state\nwhere he was arrested presumes a driver to be under the influence of alcohol. \nApplicant appeared in court on July 31, 2006. The charge of DWI was reduced to\nthe offense of Reckless Driving. Applicant entered a plea of guilty to the reduced charge\non his attorney\u2019s advice and was sentenced to serve two years on probation before\njudgment, fined $177.50, and assessed court costs in the amount of $25.50. The other two\ncharges were dismissed based on the state\u2019s motion to nolle prosequi the charges. On his\n\n3\nattorney\u2019s suggestion, Applicant also voluntarily attended an alcohol awareness class\nfollowing his arrest.\nApplicant executed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(e-Quip) on August 24, 2006. In response to a question asking if he had \u201cbeen arrested for,\ncharged with, or convicted of any offense(s) . . . ? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150\nunless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d he failed to disclose the arrest for DWI\nand the conviction of Reckless Driving with the resulting probation before judgment and\nfine of $177.50.\nApplicant provided several reasons why he failed to disclose the arrest, charge,\nconviction and fine. First, he testified he did not associate \u201cthe traffic stop with the matter\nof being able to access and secure and protect classified data.\u201d (Tr. 63) He also went on\nto explain that his attorney told him that the sentence of probation before judgment meant\nit was like the offense never happened. (Tr. 69-70) Additionally, Applicant testified that\nalthough he was handcuffed, transported to a police station in a police car, and\nfingerprinted (Tr. 110), he didn\u2019t believe he had been arrested because he had not been\nread his Miranda rights and placed in a cell. (Tr. 111) \nApplicant was questioned about his arrest and conviction by an investigator from the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) on October 6, 2006. She prepared a report of that\ninterview in which she reported Applicant told her the arresting officer told Applicant \u201che\nwas placing subject under arrest for DUI, DWI, and failing to obey a posted traffic device,\nafter subject advised the officer that he did not want to take the field breathalyzer.\u201d (GE 2)\nA copy of the investigator\u2019s report containing this statement was provided to Applicant and\non August 9, 2007, he swore or affirmed the contents thereof were accurate. Applicant\ntestified he \u201cmissed this part . . . did not pay attention to this part . . . . \u201d (Tr. 133) when\nasked about the apparent contradiction with his hearing testimony. \nApplicant attended an annual security briefing provided by his employer on August\n17, 2006. Included in that briefing were admonitions that the employer required employees\nto self-report \u201cFines Of $150 Or More (Including Traffic Violations)\u201d and \u201cTraffic Citations\nThat Are Alcohol Or Drug Related.\u201d (GE 6) Although Applicant told a co-worker about his\narrest, he did not report the arrest, charges, and fine to his employer until almost a year\nafter he had submitted the e-QIP, and was subsequently confronted by the OPM\ninvestigator about the omissions. \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n4\nE (personal conduct), with their disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant\nin this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n7\nclearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n10\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules and regulations.  \n\n5\nApplicant was arrested for and charged with DUI and DWI in March 2006. He pled\nguilty to the reduced charge of Reckless Driving in July 2006, and paid a fine and court\ncosts totaling $203. He was also sentenced to serve two years probation before judgment\nand remains on probation at present.\nApplicant executed and submitted an e-QIP on August 24, 2006. In response to the\napplicable question, he failed to disclose the arrest, charge, conviction and/or fine as\nrequired. Considering his educational level, the lengthy period of time he has held a\nsecurity clearance, the annual security clearance briefings he received, the proximity of the\nmost recent briefing to the time of his submission of the e-QIP and the substance of the\nexplanations he has provided for the omissions, his denial of deliberately falsifying the e-\nQIP is not credible. \nI have considered the fact Applicant did discuss his arrest with a co-worker and her\nexpressed opinion that she did not think it was an incident that needed to be reported.\nHowever, when weighed against the admitted facts that: 1) Applicant was briefed a mere\nweek prior to submission of the e-QIP that not only the arrest and charges were matters\nthat must be disclosed but that his fine and conviction also needed to be disclosed; 2)\nApplicant\u2019s statement to the OPM investigator that he had been told by the arresting officer\nhe was being placed under arrest; and 3) the plain language of the question, it is clear\nApplicant was aware at the time he submitted the e-QIP that he was required to list the\narrest, conviction and fine, and deliberately chose not to do so. His failure to disclose this\ninformation, as required, was a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC): 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses; and 31(c): allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted apply.     \nThe arrest, charges, and conviction that resulted from Applicant driving a vehicle\nafter consuming alcohol are isolated incidents. There is no reason to believe they will ever\nrecur. The only record evidence of prior involvement with the criminal justice system is that\nApplicant received a citation for a minor traffic offense many years ago. Additionally,\nfollowing his arrest on this occasion he voluntarily attended and successfully completed an\nalcohol awareness program. As to those offenses, Mitigating Conditions 32(a): so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 32(d): there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal\nactivity, remorse of restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record,\nor constructive community involvement apply. Accordingly, I find Applicant has mitigated\nthe criminal conduct concern that arose from his alcohol-related arrest.\nAs noted above, Applicant deliberately provided a false answer in the e-QIP in an\neffort to keep the Government from learning of his alcohol-related offense in violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. He compounded this offense by providing false testimony in his attempt\nto explain away the falsification. As noted earlier, it simply is not believable that an\nindividual with Applicant\u2019s education and work experience who has held a security\nclearance as long as Applicant has and who received a security briefing a week before\n\n6\nsubmitting the e-QIP would not have been aware of the need to disclose that information.\nAs such, I do not find any mitigating condition applies to this offense. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nFor the reasons explained above under Guideline J, I find Guideline E DC 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personal\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.\nApplicant was required by his employer to report the adverse information concerning\nhis arrest, conviction, and fine to the employer independent of providing that information\nin the e-QIP. He did not do so when the incidents occurred nor after receiving a security\nbriefing at which the reporting requirement was briefed. His obligation to self-report such\ninformation was recorded in attendance records maintained by his employer. DC 16(f):\nviolation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to employer as a\ncondition of employment applies. \nAgain, and as noted above under Guideline J, it simply is not believable that an\nindividual with Applicant\u2019s education and work experience who has held a security\nclearance as long as Applicant has and who received a security briefing during which self-\nreporting requirements were discussed would not have been aware of the need to disclose\nthe adverse information about his arrest, conviction and the resulting fine to his employer.\nAccordingly, I do not find any Guideline E mitigating condition applies.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and\nthe applicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns caused by his criminal and personal conduct. He has failed to overcome the case\nagainst him in this regard or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guidelines J and E\nare decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1. b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a & b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n_________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Daniel Lynch, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn September 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 5, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on November 1, 2007, and reassigned to me on November 28, \n2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 28, 2007, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on December 19, 2007, at Woodland Hills, California. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 8, 2008. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts relating to Iran. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not object. The request \nand the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were included in the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I through XI. Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a formal \nrequest that I take administrative notice of certain facts, as contained in HE XII and \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. AE A is a newspaper article about Iraq and Iran. I did \nnot take administrative notice of the facts in AE A, but admitted the document into \nevidence as an Applicant Exhibit. I took administrative notice of the facts in AE B. The \nfacts administratively noticed for the government and Applicant are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below. AE C was admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her \nown behalf and called four witnesses. Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a Hearing \nMemorandum which was marked HE XIII. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. She was born in \nIran.

All her siblings are U.S. citizens \nresiding in the U.S. One sister has not returned to Iran, but the other three siblings have \nvisited Iran, using Iranian passports.3  \n \n \nApplicant did not consider herself a dual citizen after she was naturalized as a \nU.S. citizen. However, Iran continued to consider her an Iranian citizen. She became \naware of some of the problems Iranian-Americans had attempting to travel to Iran with a \nU.S. passport. She felt that traveling to Iran with a U.S. passport would unduly draw \nattention to her, and she could be harassed. This is consistent with the advice in the \nState Department\u2019s Consular Information Sheet, as discussed below. She obtained an \nIranian passport in 1997. The passport expired in 2002. She renewed it in 2003. She \nvisited her mother in Iran on four occasions, in 2003, again in December 2003 through \nJanuary 2004, in 2005, and in 2006. Her passport expired in 2007. Applicant still \npossesses the expired passport. She has no immediate plans on returning to Iran, but \nmay renew the passport or obtain another Iranian passport if she has to travel to Iran \nagain to visit her mother. She does not feel comfortable attempting to enter Iran on a \nU.S. passport.4  \n \n \nApplicant feels no loyalty to the government of Iran, and has strong feelings \nagainst their current government.5 Applicant\u2019s counsel called four witnesses and \nsubmitted three character letters on her behalf. She is described as a loyal, patriotic \nAmerican with integrity, who is trustworthy, reliable, honest, dedicated, hard-working, \nand professional. They all recommended Applicant for a security clearance.6 \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d The U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n\u2022 Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction (WMD);  \n\u2022 Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n\u2022 Its support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and \n\u2022 Its dismal human rights record. \n \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq is also a concern. \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 79; GE 1. \n \n4 Tr. at 77-80, 84-88, 97; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; HE II. \n \n5 Tr. at 96. \n \n6 Tr. at 25-67; AE C. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian- \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personnel possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Center, Annual Report to Congress on Foreign \nEconomic Collection and Industrial Espionage \u2013 2000, lists the seven countries that \nmost actively engage in economic collection and industrial espionage. Iran is not among \nthe seven countries and is not named in the report. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 7(a), Acontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 7(b), Aconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation@ may raise security concerns. Applicant\u2019s mother is currently living in Iran, a \ncountry that is clearly hostile to the United States.7 It is considered the most active state \nsponsor of terrorism, and the government of Iran has committed numerous, serious \nhuman rights abuses against its people. Her mother\u2019s presence in Iran creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nIt also creates a potential conflict of interest. AG && 7(a) and (b) have been raised by \nthe evidence. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and, \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); HE I-XI. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant is clearly close to her mother. She and her siblings would like their \nmother to move permanently to the U.S. However, her mother is more comfortable in \nIran. She is elderly with no connection to the Iranian government. Applicant is a well \neducated, highly regarded engineer, and a patriotic U.S. citizen. She has deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. Applicant is also a citizen \nof Iran, a country that is hostile to the United States, sponsors terrorism, and commits \nhuman rights abuses against its people. AG & 8(b) is partially applicable. No other \nmitigating condition is applicable. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \nApplicant possessed and used an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen. The \npassport was current until it expired before the hearing. This raises a security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 10(a). The renewal of her Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen constituted \nan action to obtain recognition of her Iranian citizenship. AG \u00b6 10(b) is also applicable. \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and, \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nApplicant did not consider herself a dual citizen after she was naturalized. Iran, \nhowever, continued to consider her an Iranian citizen. She exercised her Iranian \ncitizenship by obtaining and using an Iranian passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. \nBecause of her active exercise of dual citizenship, it was not based solely on her \nparents\u2019 citizenship or birth in Iran. AG \u00b6 11(a) is not applicable. While Applicant has \nvoiced a willingness to renounce her dual citizenship, it was with a condition. Applicant \nhonestly admitted that she may need to renew or obtain another Iranian passport to \ntravel to Iran if her mother needs her. She is not truly willing to renounce her Iranian \ncitizenship as long as her mother lives in Iran. Applicant\u2019s conditional willingness to \nrenounce her Iranian citizenship is not sufficient to fully invoke AG \u00b6 11(b). Applicant\u2019s \npassport has not been destroyed or surrendered, but it has expired. I find that it is   \n\u201cotherwise invalidated,\u201d and AG \u00b6 11(e) is applicable. No other mitigating condition is \nraised by the evidence. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Iran. She \ncame to the U.S. when she was 15 years old. She became a U.S. citizen, as did her \n\n \n9 \n \n \nmother and her four brothers and sisters. She was educated here and became a highly \nregarded engineer. Applicant did not consider herself a dual citizen after becoming a \nU.S. citizen. Iran felt otherwise and continued to consider Applicant one of its citizens. \nShe felt that she could be harassed if she traveled to Iran with a U.S. passport. She \nused an Iranian passport on her four trips to Iran between 2003 and 2006. The passport \nis now expired. Applicant was open, candid, and honest at the hearing. She admitted \nthat she may renew the passport or obtain another Iranian passport if she has to travel \nto Iran again to visit her mother.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly \nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. Iran is the most active state sponsor of \nterrorism and has a dismal human rights record. Most of Applicant\u2019s family is in the \nUnited States, and her mother is a U.S. citizen. However, her mother is also an Iranian \ncitizen and is presently living in Iran. That raises considerable security concerns that \nApplicant was unable to mitigate. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her Foreign \nInfluence and Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
