On \nJune 5, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance misuse), \nGuideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant answered \nthe SOR on June 28, 2023, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 10, 2024. \nThe hearing convened on September 30, 2024. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-6, which were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-M, which were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

(Tr. 8-9) \nOn October 1, after the hearing had concluded and the record had closed, \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the wording of SOR \u00b6 2.d. The post-hearing motion \nto amend the SOR was denied. Amending the pleadings after the proceedings have \nconcluded is improper and fundamentally unfair. There was also enough information in \nthe record to make findings on that allegation. \nRequest for Administrative Notice \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of facts concerning \nUkraine.

After being terminated by his employer in 2021, he made a lateral switch \nto his current employer. Both positions required him to possess a security clearance, \nbecause his work involves classified and sensitive information. While on leave in February \n2021, he and his wife went on vacation in State B, with his sister. Marijuana is available \nfor recreational use in State B, and his sister was a marijuana user. (Tr. 17-63; GE 1, 4, \n5) \nA few days before his sister arrived in State B, Applicant traveled to a local \ndispensary and purchased marijuana, two pipes, a grinder, and a concentrated marijuana \nsubstance called Dabs. A few days later, he made a second trip to the dispensary to \npurchase marijuana with his sister. He used the marijuana on his own, and with her. (Tr. \n17-63) \nApplicant had filed his last SCA three months prior to the marijuana use, and he \nwas aware that marijuana use was not permitted with a security clearance. He testified \nhe understands that even if marijuana has been legalized at the state level, it is still illegal \nat the federal level. (Tr. 17-68; GE 6) \nAt the end of the vacation in State B, Applicant placed the items he purchased at \nthe dispensary \u2013 the pipes, grinder, dabs, and packaging in a small, zippered bag, and \nbrought it home in his checked luggage. He claimed that he had no intent to use marijuana \nagain, but wanted to show one of his friends how it was sold and packaged in State B. \nHe claimed he did not realize that he had any marijuana left over in the bag. (Tr. 17-68) \nUnder Guideline J, SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested at a military base \nin June 2021 for possession of a firearm, marijuana, and drug paraphernalia. He pleaded \nguilty to the firearm and marijuana charges. The allegation was also cross alleged under \nGuideline H in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nAfter Applicant returned from State B, he put the small, zippered bag in the \npassenger compartment of his car. It still contained the two pipes, grinder, Dabs, \npackaging, and left over product. At some point the grinder was removed from the \nzippered bag and remained on the floor of his car. The grinder had marijuana residue in \nit. He claimed he did not know how it ended up there, but asserted he was not using it to \nprocess marijuana in State A. He claimed his car was messy and cluttered, and he did \nnot know he was driving around with the marijuana and paraphernalia. (Tr. 17-68) \nIn June 2021, Applicant\u2019s car was selected for a random search at the gate of the \nmilitary base where he worked. A small pistol in a wallet style case was in his car under \nthe floor mat. He possessed a valid concealed carry permit for the pistol; however, \npersonal weapons are not permitted on base. He stated he forgot to remove it from the \ncar. Before his car was searched, Applicant took the cased pistol and put in his back \npocket to prevent it from being discovered. After police found the zippered bag with the \nmarijuana and paraphernalia, and the grinder with marijuana residue in his car, he \ninformed police he also had a pistol in his pocket.

After he successfully \ncompleted the year of probation, the charges were dropped from his record because he \nwas a first-time offender. He claimed he was pardoned by the President in November \n2022, but provided no documentation supporting this claim. The gun remained in \npossession of police on the military base. He was drug tested and then fired by his \nemployer after the arrest. The drug test from June 30, 2021, shows that he tested negative \nfor illegal drugs, including marijuana. (Tr. 17-68; GE 1, 2; AE A-F, N) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor testified. She hired him in 2015 and worked with him \nin a classified lab. She knows that he was terminated, and his access was revoked after \nhis arrest. She was aware that he tested negative for drugs in June 2021 after his arrest. \nShe was an employment reference for him in his current position. She has no concerns \nabout him having access to classified information. She reported it was a common \noccurrence on base for people to be stopped with a pistol in their car because concealed \ncarry is popular in State A. (Tr. 94-104; AE N) \nApplicant provided five work performance evaluations from 2016-2019, and a \nsigned letter that he will never use illegal drugs in the future. (AE H-M) \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and \nresident of Ukraine. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Ukraine. She met him online in 2011, and they married \nin 2012. She became a U.S. citizen in 2019. Her mother is a senior citizen living in \nUkraine, and lives on a pension. She reported that she has a close relationship with her \nmother and calls her about every morning. She last visited Ukraine in 2019 and is scared \nto travel there now because of the ongoing war. She reported that her mother lives in an \narea near the ongoing conflict. (Tr. 69-94) \nUkraine \nIn GE 3, dated August 12, 2024, the Government included recent information from \nthe U.S. Department of State about the United States\u2019 relations with Ukraine and the \ncurrent conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the facts contained in GE \n3, including the following: \nIn February 2014, Russia's forces entered and occupied Ukraine's Crimean \nPeninsula. In March 2014, Russia claimed that the peninsula had become part of the \nRussian Federation. In February 2022, Russia escalated the conflict by invading Ukraine \non several fronts. Russia had annexed numerous areas in Eastern Ukraine. This attack \nhas become the largest conventional military attack on a sovereign state in Europe since \nWorld War II.

The bombardment used drones and missiles, including missiles with \nhypersonic capability, to strike cities and civilian infrastructure across Ukraine. There \nhave been hundreds of thousands of deaths on both sides. Russia\u2019s defense industry has \nsignificantly ramped up production of long-range strike weapons, artillery munitions, and \nother capabilities that will allow it to sustain a long high-intensity war if necessary. (GE 3) \nRussia\u2019s goal is to obliterate Ukraine and subjugate its people. The invasion has \nalso created Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with over six million \nUkrainian refugees recorded globally. (GE 3) \nThe U.S. Department of State has issued a \"Level 4 - Do Not Travel\u201d warning for \nUkraine due to Russia's war against Ukraine. Significant human rights abuses have been \ncommitted by Russia's forces in areas that were under Russian control. These involved \nsevere and wide-ranging cases and included credible reports of: arbitrary or unlawful \nkillings, including extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture and cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; harsh and life threatening prison \nconditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; holding of political prisoners or detainees, \nparticularly during \"filtration\" operations; forced separation of families; forced transfer, \ndeportation, and wrongful adoption of Ukraine's children to Russian families; arbitrary or \nunlawful interference with privacy; and punishment of family members for alleged \noffenses by a relative. (GE 3) \nThere were also significant human rights issues reported involving Ukrainian \ngovernment officials, although not comparable to the scope of Russia's abuses. The \nUkrainian abuses included credible reports of forced disappearance; torture and cruel, \ninhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; harsh and life-threatening prison \nconditions; and arbitrary arrest or detention. Some of these human rights issues stemmed \nfrom martial law, which continued to curtail democratic freedoms, including freedom of \nmovement, freedom of the press, freedom of peaceful assembly, and legal protections. \nThe government often did not take adequate steps to identify and punish officials who \nmay have committed abuses. (GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical or mental impairment or \nare used in a manner inconsistent with their intended use can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to \nphysical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance \nmeans any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under federal law to manufacture, \npossess, or distribute certain drugs (Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. \nSee \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their \naccepted medical uses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical \neffects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled \nsubstance, under \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical \nuse, and no accepted safety for use in medically supervised treatment. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (a) and (b) do not apply. Applicant knew that using marijuana while \nholding a security clearance, having access to classified information, and working in a \nsensitive position was not permitted. He had worked in the defense industry for almost \ntwo and a half decades prior to the marijuana use in State B, and he had completed an \nSCA three months before. Even though he had a clean drug test in June 2021, I do not \nfind that he has no future intent to use marijuana. Four months after his trip, he was driving \naround with the marijuana and paraphrenia in a bag in his car, and the grinder containing \nresidue was out of the bag and on the floor of the vehicle. Further inconsistencies in his \nstory were revealed during cross examination.

The record shows it \nwas a series of poor decisions that occurred during his vacation in State B. The bad \ndecisions continued when he took the marijuana and paraphernalia home with him, and \nthen transported it around in his car for months. Illegal drug use is particularly egregious \nbecause Applicant possessed a security clearance and worked in a sensitive position. \nThis series of poor decisions continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for criminal conduct under AG \u00b6 31 \nand the following is applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nApplicant asserted that the circumstances that led to his arrest were a mistake. He \ntestified that he forgot his concealed carry pistol was in his car in a hidden location under \nthe floormat. He claimed that the marijuana and paraphernalia were left in his car by \naccident because the interior of his car was messy and cluttered. His claim about the \nreasons for retaining the marijuana and paraphernalia and driving around with it for \nmonths were addressed under Guideline H. I found that these things, along with his 2021 \nmarijuana use continue to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgement. \nThat finding applies under Guideline J as well. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant has not been involved in any criminal activity since June 2021. He \nsuccessfully completed a year of probation, and his charges were dismissed as a first-\ntime offender. Other than two arrests in 1999 for DUI, one which was dismissed, he does \nnot have a pattern of involvement with criminal behavior. In this case, the facts allow me \nto find that the criminal conduct concerns are mitigated by the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity. AG \u00b6 32(b) applies. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for foreign influence under AG \u00b6 7 \nand the following is applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and foreign contacts are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Active \nhostilities and ongoing military conflict in a foreign country is also of significant concern. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

Currently, the security risks are largely created by active armed conflict \nwith Russia. However, there are concerns about Ukraine\u2019s government and human rights \nrecord that must be considered once the conflict ends. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and   \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s wife has close and continuing \ncontact with her mother in Ukraine. There is a presumption that Applicant has ties of \naffection for and obligation to the immediate family members of his spouse, and the close \nbonds of affection and obligation between his wife and mother-in-law are imputed to him. \nWhile the whole country of Ukraine is affected by the war with Russia, Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law lives in an area impacted by the war. Given these facts, I do not find that it is unlikely \nthat Applicant or his wife will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, and the interests of the U.S. I do not find that no conflict \nof interest exists. Contact and communication between Applicant\u2019s wife and his mother-\nin-law are not casual or infrequent. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, J, and B in \nmy whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse and foreign influence security \nconcerns. The criminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2). Applicant relied on one witness \n(himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 4, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used methamphetamines with varying \nfrequency from approximately June 1995 through approximately December 1995; (b) \nwas discharged from the U.S Navy under Other Than Honorable Conditions in April \n1996, after testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); (c) used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from approximately 2009 through approximately 2010; (d) assisted \nwith the cultivation of marijuana in his home from approximately July 2021 through \napproximately August 2022; and (e) used hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying \nfrequency from approximately March 2022 through approximately May 2022. \nBy amendment made without objection, SOR subparagraphs were amended as \nfollows: SOR \u00b6 1.a was amended to add \u201cwhile in the U.S. Navy,\u201d and SOR \u00b6 1.b was \namended to italicize tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).Applicant admitted each of allegations \nwith the amendments without any  explanations or clarifications. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed deep remorse for his using methamphetamine while in the \nNavy and testing positive for the drug. He claimed that he smoked marijuana with his \nwife in social situations and no longer uses the drug. He also claimed that his \ninvolvement with cultivation of marijuana in his state of residence (where it is legal) was \nlimited to his financing the purchases of cultivating equipment.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n4 \n The Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because  such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \n   Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple involvement with illegal \ndrugs over a period of many years, dating to 1993.

On the strength of the \nevidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement \nand substance misuse apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance \nmisuse\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of Illegal drugs \nor drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all use and involvement \nwith illegal drugs and has remained abstinent from illegal drugs (inclusive of \nmethamphetamine, marijuana, and hallucinogenic mushrooms for almost two years. \nCurrently, he exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or \npressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use and involvement in the \nforeseeable future. \nStill, with the combination of his multiple use of illegal drugs, along with his brief \ninvolvement with the cultivation of marijuana in 2022, it is still too soon to absolve \nApplicant of risks of recurrence. Without more time to establish a probative pattern of \nsustained abstinence from drug use and involvement, none of the mitigating conditions \nare fully available to Applicant at this time. With only one-plus years of demonstrated \nabstinence from illegal drug involvement, more time with more corroborating evidentiary \nsources to support his continued abstinence are needed to facilitate safe predictions \nthat he is no longer a recurrence risk. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall, trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or sensitive \nposition. At this time, he lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in abstinence \nfrom active use and involvement with of illegal drugs to facilitate safe predictions he is at \nno risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole, and granting due weight to his positive \ncommitments to abstinence, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable \nmitigation in the record to make safe, predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to \navoid illegal drugs in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug activities over an extended number of years \nwith less than two years of sustained abstinence, he does not mitigate security \nconcerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 2.a-2-b. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 14, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudications Services (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing reasons why under the drug involvement and substance misuse \nguideline the DCSA CAS could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of \neligibility for granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, Department of \nDefense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 11, 2023, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 9, 2023. A hearing was scheduled for \nDecember 19, 2023, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the \nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of two exhibits (GEs 1-2). Applicant relied on one witness \n(himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 4, 2024. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used methamphetamines with varying \nfrequency from approximately June 1995 through approximately December 1995; (b) \nwas discharged from the U.S Navy under Other Than Honorable Conditions in April \n1996, after testing positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); (c) used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from approximately 2009 through approximately 2010; (d) assisted \nwith the cultivation of marijuana in his home from approximately July 2021 through \napproximately August 2022; and (e) used hallucinogenic mushrooms with varying \nfrequency from approximately March 2022 through approximately May 2022. \nBy Government amendment made without objection, SOR subparagraphs 2.a \nand 2,b of the Personal Conduct guideline incorporated the allegations of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.b of Guideline H and added additional language to the incorporated allegations.  \nUnder Guideline E, the added language is as follows: \u201cwhile on active duty in the U.S. \nNavy\u201d  (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and italicization of tetrahydrocannabinol (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant \nadmitted each of the allegations incorporated in the amendments without any \nexplanations or clarifications. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. He claimed deep remorse for his using methamphetamine while in the \nNavy and testing positive for the drug. He claimed that he smoked marijuana with his \nwife in social situations and no longer uses the drug. He also claimed that his \ninvolvement with cultivation of marijuana in his state of residence (where it is legal) was \nlimited to his financing the purchases of cultivating equipment. \nApplicant further claimed that his use of hallucinogenic mushrooms was limited \nand ended after only a couple months of use. And, he claimed that his COVID-19 \nvaccination refusal caused him to lose his job of many years after having been a trusted \nemployee with excellent employee evaluations and merit awards. \nAppeal Board Remand  \nOn May 9, 2024, the Appeal Board remanded this case to correct the cited \nerrors associated with findings regarding (a) assistance Applicant provided his spouse \nfor the cultivation of marijuana (as opposed to hallucinogenic mushrooms) in his state of \nresidence and (b) the mischaracterization of the Government\u2019s SOR amendments as \namendments to the Guideline H allegations, instead of adding incorporated allegations \nto newly included Guideline E allegations. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCorrections of these cited pleading drug characterization errors are incorporated \nin this remand decision.

The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant and \nmaterial findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground            \nApplicant married in November 1984 and divorced in January 1996. (GE 1) He \nhas no children from this marriage. He remarried in December 2002 and has three \nchildren from his 20-year marriage (ages 18, 20, and 23). (GE 1; Tr. 25) He earned a \nhigh school diploma in September 1993. (GE 1) \nApplicant enlisted in the Navy in October 1993 and served two and one-half \nyears of active duty. (GEs 1-2) He received a military discharge Under Other Than \nHonorable Conditions in April 1996, after testing positive for THC. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 28-32) \nSince August 2022, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nsenior automation systems engineer. (GEs 1-2) He reported unemployment between \nFebruary 2022 and August 2022, following his loss of employment with an employer of \nover 12 years over his declination to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 25-\n26) Applicant has never held a security clearance.  \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nApplicant was introduced to methamphetamine in the Navy and used it with \nvarying frequency between June 1995 and December 1995 without appreciating the \nconsequences. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 19-20, 32) Following his Navy discharge, he encountered \ndifficulties finding work and has paid the consequences. (Tr. 21) Between 2009 and \n2010, Applicant used marijuana on a couple of occasions. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 33-34) \nBetween July 2021 and August 2022, Applicant assisted his wife in cultivating \nmarijuana while using hallucinogenic mushrooms a couple of times between March and \nMay of 2022 to reduce his anxiety and pull himself out of depression. (GE 2; Tr. 21-23) \nThe help he provided his wife in cultivating marijuana in his yard consisted of \npurchasing supplies for growing the marijuana. (GE 2; Tr. 22-23, 37-38) \nNeither Applicant nor his wife have cultivated the growth of marijuana since \nAugust 2022. (Tr. 22-23) Both Applicant and his wife have made the commitment to \navoid all illegal drug use and drug cultivating processes. Applicant is committed to \nputting his past drug activity behind him and moving forward to being the person \u201cthe \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment needs me to be.\u201d (Tr. 23) His expressed hope is to restore the \nGovernment\u2019s trust in him.

(Tr. 41-42) Applicant\u2019s expressed commitments to continued \nabstinence from illegal drugs are sincere and encouraging and accepted. \n    Policies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court in \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that \ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n  Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                        \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

His use of methamphetamines and \nmarijuana in the Navy was followed by his testing positive for THC in 1996. His positive \ndrug test, in turn, resulted in his being discharged from the Navy under Other Than \nHonorable conditions in April 1996. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to his testing positive for THC in the Navy, his \ninvolvement with multiple illegal drugs (inclusive of his aiding his wife in the cultivation of \nmarijuana) raise security concerns over risks of recurrence as well as judgment issues. \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the \nAGs for drug involvement and substance misuse apply to Applicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nMarijuana use, while legalized in Applicant\u2019s state of residence, remains banned \nat the federal level as a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled \nSubstances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. \u00b6 802(32)(A)). Both methamphetamine and \nhallucinogenic mushrooms are banned under the CSA as Schedule II drugs.

Both of the SOR 2.a and 2.b allegations \nwith the added amendments are sufficiently covered by AG H as to require no separate \napplication of disqualifying and mitigating conditions covered by Guideline E. \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all use and involvement \nwith illegal drugs and has remained abstinent from illegal drugs (inclusive of \nmethamphetamine, marijuana, and hallucinogenic mushrooms for almost two years. \nCurrently, he exhibits no visible signs or indications of succumbing to any risks or \npressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use and involvement in the \nforeseeable future. \nStill, with the combination of his multiple use of illegal drugs, along with his brief \ninvolvement with the cultivation of marijuana in 2022, it is still too soon to absolve \nApplicant of risks of recurrence. Without more time to establish a probative pattern of \nsustained abstinence from drug use and involvement, none of the mitigating conditions \nare fully available to Applicant at this time. With only one-plus years of demonstrated \nabstinence from illegal drug involvement, more time with more corroborating evidentiary \nsources to support his continued abstinence are needed to facilitate safe predictions \nthat he is no longer a recurrence risk. \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall, trustworthiness, reliability, and good \njudgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or sensitive \nposition. At this time, he lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in abstinence \nfrom active use and involvement with of illegal drugs to facilitate safe predictions he is at \nno risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole, and granting due weight to his positive \ncommitments to abstinence, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable \nmitigation in the record to make safe, predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to \navoid illegal drugs in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s drug activities over an extended number of years \nwith less than two years of sustained abstinence, he does not mitigate security \nconcerns with respect to the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are not mitigated.

(FORM Reply at 2) He presented no evidence that he has undergone \nany alcohol evaluations or professional assessments of his current condition. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nUnder AG \u00b6 21, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d For most of Applicant\u2019s adult life he has \nconsumed alcohol heavily. His excessive alcohol consumption has resulted in multiple \narrests and led to the loss of two jobs. Under these circumstances, the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol-use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol-use \ndisorder. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant admitted himself into an inpatient clinic for treatment and was \ndiagnosed with severe alcohol dependence. Although he completed the program \nsatisfactorily, he declined the recommendation to attend an outpatient clinic after he was \ndischarged. Under these circumstances, the following two disqualifying conditions are also \napplicable: \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker \nof alcohol use disorder); and \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 22 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with \nany required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with the treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant deserves credit for admitting himself into an inpatient treatment clinic in \n2013 and for being sober since February 2022. However, he did not follow the  advice of \nthe treatment clinic upon discharge, and he relapsed, leading to multiple alcohol-related \nincidents over the ensuing seven years. Moreover, his declaration of sobriety was not \nsupported with the opinion of any alcohol abuse professional. Under these circumstances, \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant readily acknowledges his alcohol use problem, and he successfully \ncompleted a treatment program. However, he completed the program more than ten years \nago, and there is no record of any updated evaluations since then. Also, he declined to \nfollow the clinic\u2019s advice about seeking outpatient help. Consequently, AG \u00b6 22(d) is not \napplicable and AG \u00b6 22(b) is only applicable as to Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of his \ndrinking problem. Under these circumstances, the period of sobriety is not sufficient to fully \nmitigate the security concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nApplicant has been sober for more than two years. However, given the severity and \nlongstanding nature of his drinking problem, I conclude that his declaration of sobriety, \nwithout supporting clinical documentation is insufficient to carry the burden and fully \nmitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has an interim Secret security clearance and seeks a \npermanent Secret security clearance, which is a requirement of his continued \nemployment. (Tr. 21-23, 34-35) \nApplicant received his high school diploma in August 2015. He served in the U.S. \nMarine Corps from October 2015 to January 2021, and was separated with an Other \nthan Honorable (OTH) Discharge, discussed infra. (Tr. 23-24) His military occupational \nspecialty was 3521, automotive maintenance technician. While in the Marine Corps, \nApplicant made one overseas deployment. (Tr. 24-25) Applicant has never married and \nhas no dependents. (Tr. 25) \nSexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct \nThe sole allegation cited in the SOR under Sexual Behavior is: \u00b6 1.a - Applicant \nengaged in a sexual relationship with a minor between about May and July 2019. Two \nallegations were cited under Criminal Conduct: \u00b6 2.a - Applicant received an OTH \ndischarge from the U.S. Marine Corps in January 2021 for the offense of Misconduct \u2013 \nSexual Relationship with a Minor; and \u00b6 2.b \u2013 Cross-alleged information set forth under \n\u00b6 1.a above. \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 22, 2023 SOR Answer, he denied all the allegations, \nadding that the criminal offense alleged has a specific intent element and a mistake of \nfact defense associated with the elements. He stated that, based on the lack of intent \nand an honest and reasonable mistake of fact regarding the other party\u2019s age, Applicant \ncategorically and unequivocally denied the allegation. He added that he was never \ncharged with a crime, let alone convicted of a crime. To further clarify his response to \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant admits that he received an OTH discharge; however, he denied \nthe Guideline J allegation \u201cbased upon the pending process of appealing to BCNR \n(Board for Correction of Naval Records) based upon obvious and admitted improprieties \nof the Board members, inequities committed during the processing, and violations of \n[Appellant\u2019s] due process rights.\u201d (SOR Answer) As of Applicant\u2019s hearing date, \nApplicant had not received a response from the BCNR regarding his appeal.

(Manual for Courts Martial (2024 Edition) pgs. IV-93 to IV-94.] \nIn April 2019, Applicant met a female (F) on an Internet dating app before leaving \non deployment in July 2019. At the time, he was a 21-year-old sergeant filling the billet \nof Motor Team Maintenance Chief for his company. He stated, \u201cI was in charge of pretty \nmuch anything with wheels on it that the company utilized during our forward \ndeployment. (Tr. 27-28; SOR Answer; GE1, GE 3) The app allows for random people to \nconnect that are basically looking to \u201chook up.\u201d Applicant added that this was somewhat \ncommon among fellow Marines before leaving for deployment and was not a secret. (GE \n3) \nApplicant recalled F saying that she was 19 and that she played water polo. \nHowever, as it turned out, she was in fact 14. Applicant assumed based on her age that \nshe was in college. After meeting F, he did not think she was underage and the \npossibility of her being underage was never discussed. Furthermore, both encounters \nwere very late at night, and it did not occur to Applicant that someone who was \nunderage would be out that late. Applicant and F met on two occasions and on both \noccasions engaged in sexual activity. Shortly after his second encounter with F, \nApplicant deployed overseas and had no further contact with F. Two of Applicant\u2019s \nfriends and fellow Marines were aware of his encounters with F, corroborating that his \ninvolvement with her was not a secret. (Tr. 28-31, 37-40, 54; GE 3; SOR Answer) \nThe terms of service for the Internet dating app clearly stated, \u201c[n]o part of the \nService is directed to persons under the age of 18. IF YOU ARE UNDER 18 YEARS OF \nAGE, YOU MUST NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY \nMANNER. By using the Service, you represent and warrant you are at least 18 years of \nage. If you are under 18 years of age, then you are not permitted to use the Service.\u201d \n(GE 3, Exhibit 11) During the course of their brief relationship, Applicant and F engaged \nin an exchange of adult-like texts. Those texts included numerous photographs that F \nsent to Applicant of herself that would appear to corroborate his belief that she was 18 \nor older. (Tr. 40-42, 49-52; GE 3, Exhibits 8 & 9) \nApplicant became the subject of a Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) \ninvestigation in October 2019 after an incident involving two Marines at a different base \nand the same underage female (F).

Upon \narriving at their home base, Applicant was met by two senior NCOs from his command \nand \u201ca couple of special agents with NCIS.\u201d The agents handcuffed Applicant and \nescorted him to their station where he was read his rights, and fingerprinted. It was at \nthis time that Applicant was informed that NCIS was investigating him having possible \nsexual relations with a minor. Applicant \u201cfelt overwhelmed with this information as he \nhad no idea where these allegations came from or why he would be detained for such \nan allegation.\u201d Applicant \u201cthought it best to invoke his 5th  Amendment (Article 31(b) \nrights) until he could get proper counsel.\u201d NCIS confiscated his cell phone and released \nhim back to his command. (Tr. 31-32, 42-43; GE 3; SOR Answer)  \nAfter Applicant was released and returned to his command, he resumed his \nregular duties as a platoon sergeant with Motor Team Maintenance and \u201cwent about his \nbusiness as usual with no interaction from NCIS or JAG.\u201d He \u201cseemed to have the \nsupport of his supervisors.\u201d In June or July 2020, approximately seven months after he \nwas interviewed by NCIS in December 2019, Applicant\u2019s first sergeant notified him that \nthe Commanding General ordered that his case be referred to an Administrative \nDischarge Board to \u201cdetermine [his] future in the USMC.\u201d NCIS notified him that \u201cthere \nwas not enough evidence against [him] to bring criminal charges.\u201d NCIS found F \u201cto be \nhabitual in trying to connect with Marines on-line and determined that [Applicant] may \nnot have known the female\u2019s age at the time of their encounters.\u201d (Tr. 32-34, 44-47; GE \n3; SOR Answer) \nIn October 2020, Applicant appeared before an Administrative Separation \n(ADSEP) Discharge Board. Applicant\u2019s commanding officer recommended that if the \nBoard determined that separation was appropriate that his discharge be \u201cgeneral under \nhonorable conditions.\u201d Numerous members from Applicant\u2019s chain of command \nsubmitted favorable comments and/or recommended retention. The Board\u2019s decision \nwas that Applicant would be \u201cDischarged with an Other than Honorable\u201d discharge. \nImmediately following the hearing, Applicant\u2019s defense counsel filed a Letter of \nDeficiency with the Commanding General stating that the Board failed to review \nevidence and that board members admitted that they gathered information outside of the \nhearing, which is not allowed. Applicant\u2019s defense counsel apparently did not receive a \nfavorable response to his Letter of Deficiency. Applicant was discharged from the \nMarine Corps with an OTH discharge in January 2021. (Tr. 34, 48-49; SOR Answer) At \nthe time Applicant went to his ADSEP Discharge Board, he was a sergeant (pay grade \nE-5). However, as a result of receiving an OTH discharge, he was administratively \nreduced to a lance corporal (pay grade E-3). (Tr. 54-55) \nApplicant stated what he has learned from this experience is \u201cto be more diligent \nand do my due diligence to make sure I know exactly who I\u2019m talking to, who I\u2019m \ninteracting with, and things of that nature.\u201d He noted that he is still feeling ramifications \nand fallout following this 2019 incident that occurred approximately five years ago. He \nhad never been in trouble with the law or while in the Marines before this and has not \nbeen in any trouble with the law since.

(Tr. 52) \nCharacter Evidence \nWhile Applicant was in the Marine Corps, he volunteered at \u201ca lot of different \nthings\u201d such as golf course displays and air shows adding that \u201c[i]t kind of comes with \nthe territory of being in the military.\u201d (Tr. 27) In addition to statements submitted by \nApplicant\u2019s chain of command to the ADSEP Board recommending retention, Applicant \nsubmitted 15 reference letters from active duty and retired senior Marines and one \nreference letter from a ten-year female friend. The collective sense of these letters \nconveys that Applicant is a professional and trustworthy individual. These individuals \nsupport reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance. (AE A-P) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nSexual Behavior  \nAG \u00b6 12 articulates the security concern for sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nFollowing the principle of collateral estoppel, the record establishes the \ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a) and 13(b) requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe criteria pertinent to a collateral estoppel determination are (1) that the party \nagainst whom it is asserted had an opportunity to litigate the earlier case; (2) that the \nissues in the current hearing are the same as those in the prior one; and (3) that \napplication of collateral estoppel must not result in unfairness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n09-02752 at 4, n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2010). The Appeal Board has previously held that \nMSPB hearings can satisfy the requirements of collateral estoppel. ISCR Case No. 03-\n24233 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2005). Collateral estoppel is a due process doctrine that \nessentially requires the Government to accept the result of a hearing, especially where \nthere is an affirmative fact that has or has not been proven. The Supreme Court has \nhistorically applied collateral estoppel to civil litigation and civil matters. See Montana v. \nUnited States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979); Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 443 (1970). \nUnder this due process or fairness doctrine, the DOHA should accept the finding of the \nseparation board as conclusive, unless there is new, contradicting evidence that there \nwas fraud on the separation board, or there is some other compelling evidence that \nraises a serious concern about the fairness of the separation board. The serious issues \nraised by Applicant in the administrative appeal options have not been addressed by the \nBCNR as of the issuance of this decision. \nAG \u00b6 14 includes four conditions that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and  \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) fully apply, and 14(d) partially applies. At the time \nApplicant had sexual relations two times with F in 2019, he was 21 years old. He is now \n27 and almost six years have elapsed since the sexual activity. Despite these \nallegations hanging over him, Applicant continued to perform his duties as a Marine in \nan exemplary manner, as documented by his performance evaluations. Applicant\u2019s \nfellow Marines and his command were aware of his involvement with F. With that said, \nhis involvement did not dissuade his chain of command and senior leadership from \nsupporting him before his ADSEP Discharge Board or after he was discharged from the \nMarine Corps, as evidenced by letters of support. With the status of the ADSEP \nDischarge Board\u2019s final results pending with the BCNR, AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause a 14-year-old child cannot legally consent to sexual activity. Because of the \napplicability of collateral estoppel, I cannot find Applicant did not commit the crime of \nsexual assault of a child. \nCriminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and (d), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion under the applicability of Sexual Behavior disqualifying conditions, supra, is \napplicable. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (d) are fully applicable for the reasons discussed under the \nSexual Behavior mitigating conditions. \nWhole Person Analysis  \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant or continue \nnational security eligibility \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guidelines D and J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed in my discussion of those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nWhen Applicant was a 21-year-old Marine, he made the decision to visit an \nInternet dating app in 2019 to engage in sexual activity with a female before embarking \non an overseas deployment. Up until that point, he had a promising career in the Marine \nCorps and held a responsible billet of Motor Team Maintenance Chief for his company. \nUnfortunately, the female turned out to be a 14-year-old minor. Applicant\u2019s involvement \nwith F led to the end of what was otherwise a promising Marine Corps career. \nAn administrative separation board determined he committed serious misconduct \nand he received an OTH discharge. Applicant denied that he had knowledge that F was \na minor. At this juncture, there is no way of knowing what the ADSEP Discharge \nBoard\u2019s underlying thought process was in reaching their decision. Applicant has a \npending petition with the BCNR to address some serious deficiencies in how the \nADSEP Discharge Board conducted its deliberations. Even if Applicant\u2019s BCNR petition \nis denied, mitigation is warranted primarily as a result of the passage of time, i.e. six \nyears since his brief encounters with F. As a result of this incident, Applicant learned a \nhard lesson and no longer participates in social media. He is far more cautious in \ndealing with persons unknown to him. He continues to be a law-abiding citizen.

Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991).

Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nApplicant mitigated the Guidelines D (sexual conduct) and J (criminal conduct) security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \nFor Applicant \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n   Paragraph 2, Guideline J:  \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s financial troubles stemmed from funding his former\u2019s wife\u2019s gambling habit from 2014 to 2018. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g represent delinquent credit-card accounts, and SOR 1.d is a delinquent personal loan. The total amount of delinquent debt is $43,105. Applicant admitted the six allegations without explanations. Applicant is 37 years old and has been divorced twice. He has no children. His financial problems occurred during his first marriage from August 2014 to April 2018. (Item 3 at 19) Applicant has rented from the same United States (U.S.) residential location since January 2014. He earned several college credits from January 2012 to July 2014, but attained no degree. Between January 2017 to December 2018, he earned credits from a technical college, but achieved no degree. (GE 3 at 8-10) He is seeking his first security clearance. (Item 3 at 46) Since September 2020, Applicant has been employed as an engineering technician by a defense contractor. Before his current job, he worked for a temporary agency for seven months. From November 2015 until his termination in February 2020, he was a group leader.

He elected to \nhave his case decided on an administrative (written) record instead of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel for the Government sent a copy of the File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), the Government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR, to \nApplicant on August 9, 2023. He received the FORM on September 11, 2023. The \nGovernment advised him that in his response, he could either file objections, furnish \nexplanations, submit additional material, or take advantage of all three options within 30 \ndays of receiving the FORM. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due on October \n11, 2023. No response was received by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals. \n(DOHA). I was assigned the case on January 4, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR contains six allegations under the financial considerations guideline. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s financial troubles stemmed from funding his former\u2019s \nwife\u2019s gambling habit from 2014 to 2018. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g represent \ndelinquent credit-card accounts, and SOR 1.d is a delinquent personal loan. The total \namount of delinquent debt is $43,105. Applicant admitted the six allegations without \nexplanations. \nApplicant is 37 years old and has been divorced twice. He has no children. His \nfinancial problems occurred during his first marriage from August 2014 to April 2018. \n(Item 3 at 19) Applicant has rented from the same United States (U.S.) residential \nlocation since January 2014. He earned several college credits from January 2012 to \nJuly 2014, but attained no degree. Between January 2017 to December 2018, he \nearned credits from a technical college, but achieved no degree. (GE 3 at 8-10) He is \nseeking his first security clearance. (Item 3 at 46) \nSince September 2020, Applicant has been employed as an engineering \ntechnician by a defense contractor. Before his current job, he worked for a temporary \nagency for seven months. From November 2015 until his termination in February 2020, \nhe was a group leader. He breached company policy by showing favoritism. His \nexplanation of how the infraction occurred is not clear from the record. However, it \nappears that his selection process for determining which employees would be assigned \nto which work shifts ran afoul of company policy. Prior to November 2015, Applicant \nwas a server and an assembler. (Item 3 at 10-18) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant admitted his financial problems arose through his \nfunding of his former wife\u2019s gambling habit from 2014 to 2018. His wife used his credit \ncards at the local casino. (Item 4 at 5) Applicant\u2019s marriage began in 2014 and ended in \n2018 when he could no longer finance her habit. The delinquent credit-card and \npersonal loan balance over $40,000 implies that he spent much more than $1,000 over \na four-year-period for her gambling.

This loan was opened to pay for Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s gambling \nin 2015 and 2016.(Item 4 at 8; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2) The debt has not been paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 The past-due amount of this credit-card account is $20,575, with \nthe last payment activity on the account is August 2019. Applicant conceded that he \nused the credit card to finance vacations, gambling and clothing. (Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at \n2, Item 4 at 7) The account is unpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2013 This is a charged off delinquent credit-card account totaling $720. \nApplicant\u2019s last payment activity on this account was June 2018. (Item 4 at 7; Item 5 at \n5) The account is not resolved.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \u2013 This is a charged off delinquent credit-card account amounting to \n$12,196. The last payment activity on the account was July 2019. (Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at \n2) Applicant has not paid this account.  \nApplicant furnished inconsistent statements about his former wife\u2019s gambling \nhabit. He did not interpret paying for her gambling sojourns, clothing purchases, and \naway from home dining events as constituting irresponsible financial support for her \nspendthrift spending habits. (Item 4 at 9) After he was terminated from his group leader \njob in February 2020, his next job provided insufficient income for him to pay on any of \nthe listed delinquent accounts, except for another credit card, which is not alleged in the \nSOR. He repaid that account through a wage garnishment. (Item 4 at 9-10) \nApplicant claimed he called listed several creditors by phone, but their practice \nof keeping him waiting for them to connect and talk to him or their inability to return his \ncalls made him less interested in making contact with them. He did not respond to \ncreditor letters. (Item 4 at 10) \nApplicant intends to file for bankruptcy in the next six months to a year. Except \nfor the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, Applicant is able to pay his other financial \nobligations. He realizes that he was living beyond his means during his first marriage, \nbut he believes his financial profile has changed. Applicant enrolled in a debt \nconsolidation program in 2018, but discontinued the service when he discovered the \nmonthly payments were too high. (Item 4 at 11) Without disclosing what he has done to \nexplain how he has changed his financial habits; it is impossible to determine that his \ncurrent financial management is better than during his first marriage from 2014 to 2018. \n3 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide any information about his yearly or monthly earnings or his \nfinancial practices, such as whether he has a budget. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be \nresolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regard less of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicat4d by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or non-payment, or other \nnegative financial factors.  \nThe surrounding facts leading to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g accounts becoming \ndelinquent between June 2018 and September 2022 support the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). I am unable to apply SOR \u00b6 19(b) because of Applicant\u2019s successful \nresolution of an unalleged credit card account that became delinquent between 2014 \nand 2018. Furthermore, Applicant has not indicated he does not want to satisfy the \nlisted debts, though he is ruminating over filing bankruptcy. To his credit he tried to \ncontact the creditors. His dilemma is that he simply does not have the necessary funds \nto address the creditors.AG \u00b6 19(e) applies due to Applicant\u2019s admission that he was \nliving beyond his means in financing his wife\u2019s gambling habit and leading to his \nexcessive indebtedness.  \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThough the listed accounts became delinquent six years ago or less, the \naccounts are still delinquent. I believe Applicant tried to contact the creditors, but he has \nproduced no plan of how he intends to handle the delinquent debt. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does has some application to the circumstances of this case. \nApplicant was terminated from his group leader position in February 2020 for showing \nfavoritism. Since Applicant had been working for this employer for almost five years, I \nam unable to conclude that his conduct rose to an actionable level to justify the \n5 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ntermination. The record shows he resumed employment in the same month, and he has \nbeen steadily employed since then. The reason for Applicant\u2019s financial problems was \nhis first wife\u2019s gambling habits. Though it took him four years, he receives some credit \nfor acting responsibly under the circumstances by ending the marriage in 2018, thereby \nstaunching deeper financial problems. Failure to act responsibly before he did, was due \nto not realizing that he was adopting the same extravagant financial practices of his \nformer wife.  \nApplicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he has never had \nfinancial counseling. His participation in the debt consolidation service ended when he \ndecided the monthly payments were too high, and it is inferred that he was not enrolled \nin the service for long. There is no clear indication that his listed debts are being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant has not \nprovided a good faith effort to the delinquent creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 37 years old and has been married twice. He has no children. He \nbeen an engineering technician since September 2020. He married his first wife in \n2014. By the time of the 2018 divorce, he has accumulated debt of over $43,000, due \nprimarily to his wife\u2019s uncontrollable gambling habit. He does not have a plan to repay \nthe listed creditors. Even if he succeeds in discharging the listed debt through a Chapter \n7 Bankruptcy discharge, this legal action does not constitute a good-faith effort to pay \nhis debts with a meaningful track record of repayments. Having considered the entire \nrecord from an overall common-sense point of view, including the lack of evidence of \nfinancial counseling and character evidence, the financial considerations and personal \nconduct guidelines have not been mitigated. \n6 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems in 1984 and a master\u2019s degree in in the same field in 2005. (GE 1 at 12) Applicant has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor since 2021. In 2005, Applicant purchased his current home. He kept his previous home, deciding to use it as a rental property. Applicant financed the purchase of the new home in 2005 with an adjustable-rate mortgage. (Tr. 75) Over the years, the interest rate continuously increased. By approximately 2015, it was $4,200 per month, an amount Applicant and his wife could not afford. (Tr. 75) At or about the time the mortgage payment on his primary residence increased drastically, the tenant in his rental property stopped paying the rent. (Tr. 39) In the six months it took to evict him, he did not pay any rent. (Tr. 39) Ultimately, Applicant lost control of his finances and was unable to keep up with his mortgage payments on his primary residence, prompting the bank to initiate foreclosure actions in February 2016. (GE 10 at 1; Tr. 65) While the foreclosure action was pending, Applicant\u2019s wife was laid off for six months. (Tr. 42) In July 2017, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection.

At the \nhearing, I received 11 Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 11), 8 exhibits of Applicant \n(Applicant\u2019s exhibit (AE) A through AE H), and Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript was \nreceived on April 19, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 64-year-old married man with three adult children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems in 1984 and a master\u2019s degree in in the \nsame field in 2005. (GE 1 at 12) Applicant has been working for his current employer, a \ndefense contractor since 2021. \nIn 2005, Applicant purchased his current home. He kept his previous home, deciding \nto use it as a rental property. Applicant financed the purchase of the new home in 2005 with \nan adjustable-rate mortgage. (Tr. 75) Over the years, the interest rate continuously \nincreased. By approximately 2015, it was $4,200 per month, an amount Applicant and his \nwife could not afford. (Tr. 75) At or about the time the mortgage payment on his primary \nresidence increased drastically, the tenant in his rental property stopped paying the rent. \n(Tr. 39) In the six months it took to evict him, he did not pay any rent. (Tr. 39) Ultimately, \nApplicant lost control of his finances and was unable to keep up with his mortgage \npayments on his primary residence, prompting the bank to initiate foreclosure actions in \nFebruary 2016. (GE 10 at 1; Tr. 65) While the foreclosure action was pending, Applicant\u2019s \nwife was laid off for six months. (Tr. 42) \nIn July 2017, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (GE 4; Tr. 48) The \ncase was dismissed in September 2017 after Applicant, representing himself, missed a \ncreditors\u2019 meeting. (Tr. 51) \nIn September 2018, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. (GE 7) In \nJuly 2019, Applicant was laid off and was subsequently unemployed for the next five \nmonths. (GE 1 at 17) In November 2019, the bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy \npleading after Applicant failed to submit required documents on time. (GE 7 at 2) Although \nApplicant never re-filed for bankruptcy protection, he had either satisfied or caught up on all \nof the commercial debts that had been listed in the bankruptcy by September 2021. (GE 1 \nat 17; GE 2 at 2) \nIn October 2021, Applicant\u2019s home was foreclosed upon. (Tr. 75) At that time, he \nowed a $600,000 balance. (Tr. 75; GE 10 at 15) Because of unresolved litigation between \nthe bank and a third party regarding the deed, the bank has been unable to take \npossession of the property, and Applicant has remained in the home. (Tr. 74) Applicant no \nlonger has a legal interest in the property and has not made payments since the \nforeclosure. (Tr. 56) There is no possibility that he will owe either of the litigants any money \nafter their dispute has been resolved. (Tr. 60) It is unclear from the record whether \nApplicant still owns the property that he had been renting to tenants. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant has been living in the foreclosed home, he has been using money \nhe otherwise would have been using to make mortgage payments to invest in his \nretirement pension and a savings account. (Tr. 57, 65) Using some of this money, he made \na downpayment towards the purchase of another home. (Tr. 57-58) He was approved for \nthe new mortgage despite the unresolved nature of the foreclosure litigation on the house \nwhere he is living currently. The price of the new home is $458,000 (Tr. 57) Additionally, \nApplicant has $150,000 invested in a retirement account and $7,000 in a savings account. \n(Tr. 59-60) All of the debts that were listed in the bankruptcy petitions of 2017 and 2018 \nhave either been paid or are current. (Tr. 58) \nApplicant earns $120,000 per year. (Tr. 43) He maintains a budget and has \napproximately $1,000 of monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 43) \nApplicant is highly respected in his community. According to a fellow church \nmember, he is a man \u201cof remarkable integrity\u201d with \u201can admirable work ethic.\u201d (AE G) As a \nmember of the church council, he oversees $3,000,000 of church assets with \u201chonesty and \nintegrity.\u201d (AE H) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in deciding. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d   \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by foolish or irresponsible spending. \nRather, they were caused by a series of unfortunate circumstances, including his wife\u2019s job \nloss, and lost income after a rental property tenant defaulted on his lease, that occurred at \nthe same time his mortgage interest rates began increasing. Applicant attempted to \naddress these problems by filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, and later, Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. Although both cases were dismissed on procedural grounds, he eventually \nsatisfied or brought current the other debts included in the petitions. Under these \ncircumstances AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d applies. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s home was foreclosed, he has continued to live there since his \nrequirement to vacate is stayed pending the resolution of litigation between the bank and a \nthird party with a contested property interest in the home. Applicant is not required to pay \nrent while the litigation is pending. Moreover, he has $7,000 in savings, $150,000 invested \nin a retirement account, and he recently financed the purchased of a new home. Under \nthese circumstances, I conclude that the behavior \u201coccurred under such circumstances that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(a)) and that there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is . . . \nunder control.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)). Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to the mitigating conditions, I considered Applicant\u2019s volunteerism and the \nrespect in which he is held by his acquaintances.

(Tr. 22, 24) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns . . . as required.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying condition in \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying condition is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \napplicable in this case are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;    \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) \nexplained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating conditions as \nfollows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He had difficulty \nobtaining information about federal and state income taxes while working for his company \noverseas. He worked very hard for his employer, and this left him with less time and \nenergy to complete federal and state tax returns. However, \u201c[e]ven if [an applicant\u2019s] \nfinancial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or \nher] control, the [administrative judge] could still consider whether [the applicant] has \nsince acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). He did not establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. SOR \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. \nApplicant failed to timely file as required his federal and state income tax returns \nfor TYs 2014 through 2020. He gave a lower priority to completion of his tax returns than \nhe did for his work for the defense contractor. His federal income tax returns for TYs 2019 \nthrough 2020 were filed in May 2022. Several tax earlier returns were not filed by the time \nof his hearing. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a \nfederal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor. . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns, the Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016), the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this instance, Applicant failed to timely file as required his federal and state \nincome tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2020.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old engineering manager who has been employed by a large \ndefense contractor since 2004. In 2005, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in a specialized \ntype of engineering. He has held a security clearance since 2005, and there is no \nevidence of security violations. He lived in a foreign country from November 2013 through \nSeptember 2018. He worked very hard to meet his employer\u2019s requirements, and this \nincluded deployments and rotations away from his residence in the United States. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2020. Several tax earlier \nreturns were not filed by the time of his hearing. He gave a higher priority to other matters \nthan filing his tax returns. His failure to take timely, prudent, responsible, good-faith \nactions from April 2015 (when his TY 2014 tax return was due) to get his tax returns timely \nfiled to present raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

His request for eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 14, 2022, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nas part of his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information. \nOn May 2, 2023, the DCSA issued and sent to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline J (Criminal \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on August 17, 2023. The FORM proffered 13 exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 13) on which the Government relied to support the SOR allegations. Applicant \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits or to \nprovide other additional information. He did not respond to the FORM, and he did not file \nany objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits within the allotted time. Accordingly, GX 1 \u2013 \n13 became part of the record, which closed on September 20, 2023. I received the case \nfor decision on November 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that in August 2020, Applicant was charged \nin State A with felony malicious wounding, felony use of a firearm in the commission of a \nfelony, misdemeanor brandishing of a firearm, and misdemeanor assault and battery on \na family member. Further, it was alleged that in March 2022, he was arrested in State B \nand extradited to State A, where he pleaded guilty to the two misdemeanor charges and \nwas sentenced to 12 months in jail with 10 months suspended (SOR 1.a). \nAlso under Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was incarcerated in State \nC between December 2007 and November 2009 for multiple burglary offenses (SOR 1.b); \nthat in November 2002, he was arrested in State C and charged with burglary and a \nparole violation (SOR 1.c); that in November 2001, he was arrested and charged in State \nC with felony burglary, resisting and officer, and simple battery (SOR 1.d); that in February \n2001, he was arrested and charged in State C with felony forcible rape, to which he \npleaded guilty and served six months in jail (SOR 1.e); and that between 1989 and 2000, \nhe was arrested and charged on multiple occasions with various crimes, including \nburglary, theft, and forgery (SOR 1.f). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each \nof these allegations and provided a lengthy explanation of the events addressed in SOR \n1.a. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally made false official \nstatements to a government investigator during a November 21, 2022, personal subject \ninterview (PSI) regarding the events addressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 2.a). He admitted this \nallegation with an explanation, a plain reading of which indicates he reaffirms his \nstatement to the investigator. Accordingly, I have interpreted his response as a denial of \nthe requisite intent to falsify.

(SOR 3.a \u2013 3.k) In response, he admitted each of those allegations \nand claimed he has paid the debts at SOR 3.a and 3.k, and that he is resolving the debts \nat SOR 3.d and 3.g. (FORM, Items 1 and 3) \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on my \nreview of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 53 years old. He is being sponsored for a clearance by a defense \ncontractor in State B, where he has lived since October 2021. He was born in State C in \n1970. State and federal criminal records obtained during Applicant\u2019s background \ninvestigation show that since early 1989, when he was 18 years old, he has been arrested \nand charged more than 30 times with various criminal offenses, including burglary, \nassault, use of a weapon in the commission of a felony, forgery, trespassing, and forcible \nrape. It further appears that he has been incarcerated for criminal offenses for periods \nranging from two months to almost two years. The Government\u2019s information supports \nthe allegations of multiple criminal charges presented in SOR 1.a \u2013 1.f. (FORM, Items 1, \n3, 5 \u2013 9) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent arrest arose from his conduct in August 2020 in State A. \nHe assaulted his former girlfriend by hitting her in the head with a handgun. He did so \nafter becoming angry when she told him she was seeing someone else, even though they \nhad parted ways eight months earlier. A photo included in the police report compiled on \nthe night of that incident shows the victim with blood on her face and shirt. A responding \npolice officer observed that there was a gash in the victim\u2019s head that would require \nmedical treatment and that the victim appeared concussed. Applicant had left the scene \nbefore police arrived and was subsequently determined to be a fugitive. He was arrested \nin State B in March 2022 and extradited to State A where the two felony charges listed in \nSOR 1.a were entered as nolle prosequi, and he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor \ncharges. All but two months of a 12-month jail sentence were suspended. (FORM, Items \n4 \u2013 7, 9, and 10) \nWhen Applicant listed the August 2020 incident in his e-QIP, he stated only that \nhe was charged with simple assault and battery, and that he was released after he was \narrested. He further stated that the victim initiated the incident and that he was arrested \n\u201cbecause she was a female and she started it.\u201d During his PSI with a government \ninvestigator, Applicant discussed this event and characterized it as a \u201ccat fight\u201d in which \nthe victim started slapping him, so he slapped her back. He claimed that he only \naccidentally scratched her in the process and may have drawn a little blood. In his \nresponse to SOR 1.a, he repeated this version of events. (FORM, Items 3 \u2013 5) \nThe Government\u2019s information and Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions support the \nallegations under Guideline F. Applicant did not list any adverse financial information as \nrequired by e-QIP Section 26 (Financial Record). Nonetheless, he admits the allegations \nthat he owes the debts listed in SOR 3.a \u2013 3.k. In his PSI, he stated that he started \nexperiencing financial difficulties in about July 2020 after a contract he was on ended. In \nresponse to the SOR, he claimed he had paid the debt at SOR 3.a.

However, he also claimed to have \npaid the debt at SOR 3.k and that he was resolving SOR 3.d and 3.g. He did not provide \ninformation that supports those claims or that indicates the current state of his personal \nfinances. (FORM, Items 3, 5, 11 \u2013 13) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has engaged in persistent, and at times, \nviolent criminal conduct for most of his adult life. For his offenses, he has been \nincarcerated on multiple occasions. This information reasonably raises the security \nconcern addressed at AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nMore specifically, the following AG \u00b6 31 disqualifying conditions must be applied \nhere: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nI also have considered the mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply here. This record reflects a lifetime of \ncriminal conduct without any evidence of rehabilitation. To the contrary, his patently false \nversion of events in his most recent arrest undermines any sense that he has taken \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsibility for his conduct. Applicant failed to meet his burden of producing reliable \ninformation that would refute or mitigate the security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. \nPersonal Conduct  \nDuring Applicant\u2019s PSI in November 2020, he presented a version of the events \nthat transpired in August 2020 that bears no resemblance to the information contained in \nthe police report and photographs compiled on the night they occurred. He also minimized \nhis disclosure of that conduct in his e-QIP and in his response to SOR 1.a. I find that all of \nthe available information probative of his intent in making his statements during the PSI \nshows that he did so deliberately and with the purpose of misleading the government about \nhis conduct. This information raises the security concern about Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness stated at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 16(b): \ndeliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \nThe record does not support either of these mitigating conditions. Applicant did not \npromptly correct his false statements to the investigator. Rather, as noted above, he \nrepeated his version of events when he responded to the SOR. His claims that he \nsomehow acted in self-defense after the victim slapped him during a \u201ccat fight,\u201d when \ncompared to a contemporaneous police report and photos of the victim, are simply not \nbelievable. His willingness to stick with that story in response to the SOR further \ndemonstrates his intent to mislead the government. The security concerns raised under \nthis guideline remain unresolved. \nFinancial Considerations \nAvailable information shows that Applicant accrued 11 delinquent debts totaling in \nexcess of $15,000. He has resolved one of those debts. His claims of payment or \nresolution efforts for his remaining debts are unsupported. This information reasonably \nraises the security concern about finances stated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAdditionally, this record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying \nconditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information establishes that the debt at SOR 3.a has been resolved; \nhowever, there is no other information in this record that would support application of any \nof the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent insofar as most of his delinquent debts \nremain unresolved. While his financial problems may have resulted from a loss of \nemployment income, he did not establish that he acted responsibly in the face of those \ncircumstances. There is no indication that he has received financial counseling, and aside \nfrom resolution of the debt at SOR 3.a, there is no documentation of any good-faith \nrepayment effort by Applicant. On balance, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns about his financial problems. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines J, E, and F, I have reviewed the record before me \nin the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant did not provide \nany reliable information that would counterbalance the security concerns raised by his \nextensive and varied record of criminal conduct, his willingness to misrepresent his most \nrecent offenses, and his ongoing financial problems. Accordingly, significant doubts about \nhis judgment and suitability for clearance persist. Because protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a  - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b \u2013 3.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor security clearance eligibility is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

For good cause shown, Applicant was \ngranted seven calendar days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was \nafforded two days to respond.

Before filing them, he was awaiting instructions from his tax preparer. \n(AEs C-G; Tr. 41-42) \nAs with his federal tax returns, Applicant\u2019s State A tax returns for tax years 2018-\n2020 and 2022 were not filed before his security clearance hearing in November 2023. \n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 27-28, 41-42) Among his post-hearing submissions was a documented \nState A tax filing (dated December 2023) for tax year 2019. His submitted October 2023 \ntax correspondence from his tax preparer referenced the prepared tax return for tax \nyear 2019, but did not cover any of the other State A tax years covered in the SOR. (AE \nP) And, Applicant\u2019s signed 2019 State A tax return bears a signature date of December \n2023. (AE P) Without more documentation from Applicant, State A tax returns for the \nmissing 2018 and 2020-2022 tax years cannot be credited to Applicant as filed returns \nfor these years in issue. Applicant attributed his late tax filings to procrastination. (Tr. \n42) \nBecause Applicant failed to provide any documented evidence of filing his State \nB income tax return for tax year 2018, he cannot be credited with filing a State B tax \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \nreturn for that tax year. Based on the evidence produced and developed by Applicant to \ndate, Applicant\u2019s due 2018 tax return for State B remains unfiled. \nBesides his federal and state tax filing lapses, Applicant accumulated 11 \ndelinquent debts exceeding $102,000. (GEs 1-4) To date, most of his accrued debts \nremain unaddressed and outstanding. (GEs 1-4) Currently, he has no documented \npayment plan or plans for addressing the bulk of these debts. (Tr. 42-43) Nor does he \nhave any identified resources to pay his SOR creditors (either through payoffs or \npayment plans) Asked why some of the listed SOR debts have fallen off of his credit \nreport, Applicant could provide no meaningful explanations for most of them. Although, \nhe did acknowledge that several of these creditors (1.e., those with accounts covered \nby SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.e, 1.g and 1.j) made contact with him in their efforts to resolve the \ndebts. (Tr. 44-53) \nWhile Applicant has paid off one creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.h), accepted payment offers \nfrom two of the listed SOR creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g) and made payments to them \nin accordance with the settlement terms with these creditors (AEs M and R-S), the \nremainder of his SOR-listed debts remain unaddressed. (Tr. 43-54) Applicant attributed \nhis delinquent accounts to several sources: business losses, embezzlement by a former \nemployee, and procrastination. (AE K; Tr. 33-34, 42-49) \nWhether Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts (exceeding $102,000) are business-\nrelated, personal, or a combination of both is unclear. Because he accepts responsibility \nfor all of the debts (reported as individually opened accounts in his credit reports), \ndistinctions between business and personal debts make no material difference in \nassessing Applicant\u2019s payment obligations for the debts. Legally, he remains liable for \nall of the debts regardless of how they are classified. (GEs 1-4) \n Endorsements  \nApplicant\u2019s son and business partner endorsed him. (Tt. 60-63) Together, they \ntransport military components for the DoD. (Tr. 61) Applicant\u2019s son described himself \nand Applicant as \u201cfantastic truck drivers\u201d and consistently available for whatever is \ntimely needed by the DoD. (Tr. 60) He credited Applicant with trustworthiness and \nacceptance of responsibility for whatever obligations are imposed on persons who hold \nsecurity clearances.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  . .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Additional security concerns are raised over \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (11 in all) exceeding $102,000. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s multiple tax-filing lapses warrant the application of one of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns, or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d applies to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax-filing lapses, albeit accompanied by explanations of his \nupdated filing of his tax returns, require no independent proof to substantiate them. See \nDirective 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His \nadmitted tax-filing failures are fully documented and create judgment issues as well over \nthe management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax-filing failures and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking \naccess to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. \n14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. \n18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

In the past, the Appeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens \non applicants to provide documentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial \nproblems, whether the issues relate to back taxes, consumer, medical, or other debts \nand accounts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR \nCase No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd.

He is 42 years old and married. He attended college from February 2015 to December 2019, and he earned an associate degree in May 2017 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2019. He served in the U.S. military from November 2000 to December 2011. As of his October 2022 security clearance application (SCA), he was working as a security officer for his employer, a DOD contractor. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 1, 2) The SOR alleges that Applicant had ten delinquent consumer debts totaling $38,971 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.k) and two medical accounts in collection, for $514 and $238, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.l).

He is 42 years old and married. He \nattended college from February 2015 to December 2019, and he earned an associate \ndegree in May 2017 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2019. He served in the U.S. \nmilitary from November 2000 to December 2011. As of his October 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA), he was working as a security officer for his employer, a \nDOD contractor. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 1, 2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had ten delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$38,971 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.k) and two medical accounts in collection, for $514 and \n$238, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.l). The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his Answer, October 2022 SCA, November 2022 background interview \nwith an authorized DOD investigator, and credit bureau reports from October 2022 and \nAugust 2023. (Items 1-5) \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that he was disputing the debts that he denied \nbecause he had \u201cno legal binding contract\u201d with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d\u00ad\n1.h, and 1.l, and he was contesting the amount claimed by the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He \nalso stated that he was making payment arrangements to pay the three debts that he \nadmitted. He did not provide proof of his efforts to dispute his debts, or of any attempts \nto negotiate payment arrangements to pay his debts. (Item 1) \nDuring his background interview, however, Applicant acknowledged that the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g and 1.i-1.k were his. He indicated that he was unaware of the \nmedical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.l, but he intended to contact the creditors to verify \nthem. In 2016, he and his spouse opened the furniture store account in SOR \u00b6 1.j, and it \nbecame delinquent in 2018 because of their inability to pay. In 2019, he opened the \naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.a to finance his purchase of a $14,000 car at $512 monthly for 36 \nmonths. He surrendered the car to the dealer in 2020 when he could no longer afford to \nmake the car payment. Also in 2019, he opened the checking account in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and \nthe account became delinquent in 2020 due to overdraft and bank charges. (Item 3) \nIn 2021, Applicant hired an attorney for $3,000 to assist him with claiming \nveterans\u2019 disability benefits. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Once he was awarded 100% disability \nbenefits, the attorney increased his charges to which Applicant disagreed. Also in 2021, \nhe opened a cellular service account (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When he closed the account in 2022 \nbecause of poor service, he had an outstanding balance for the last month of service. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant obtained the credit cards for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and \n1.k between 2020 and 2022, to purchase clothes and shoes (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and to build \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis credit (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.k). The accounts became delinquent because he \ncould not afford to pay them. (Item 3) \nApplicant stated in his SCA that he was unemployed from December 2011 to \nMay 2016. He indicated during his background interview that he experienced financial \ndifficulties after leaving the military because he did not have direction on employment \nand was unemployed. He did not list any subsequent periods of unemployment on his \nSCA. He listed that he worked part time for a package delivery company from May 2016 \nto August 2017, while attending college. He also listed that he left his employment in \nMay 2018 after sustaining an injury for which his employer did not accommodate, but he \nlisted that he immediately began working for another employer. He also indicated that \nhe left that employment in August 2022 due to COVID, but he listed that he immediately \nbegan working as a security officer for his current employer. He acknowledged during \nhis background interview that he lived beyond his means from 2011 to 2021. In 2021, \nhe realized that he needed to address his financial issues in order to care for his family. \n(Items 2-3) \nApplicant described his financial situation as a work in progress during his \nbackground interview. He indicated that he has enough money to pay his monthly \nexpenses and his outstanding debts. He intends to meet his financial obligations. There \nis no evidence in the record that he received any financial counseling. (Item 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. \nHowever, he also acknowledged that he lived beyond his means from 2011 to 2021. He \nfailed to show that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He has not provided \ndocumentation showing that he has made any effort to address his delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence that he has received credit counseling. There are not clear \nindications that his financial problems are being resolved or are under control. I find that \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The action \nwas taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on August 8, 2023, and he elected to \nhave the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s \nwritten case, a file of relevant material (FORM), which included documents identified as \nItems 1 through 5, was submitted on August 31, 2023.

The case was \nassigned to me on January 4, 2024. Items 1 through 5 are admitted in evidence without \nobjection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, and he denied SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. He is 39 years old. He has never married, and he does not have any children. He \ngraduated from high school in May 2002. He attended college from September 2002 to \nDecember 2007 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has owned his home since 2018. \n(Items 1-4) He has worked as an audio video engineer for a private company since July \n2014. He has never held a security clearance. He is being sponsored for a public trust \nposition. (Items 3, 5) \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from January \n1998 to at least February 2022, including after he completed an e-QIP on January 7, \n2022, to obtain a DOD position of trust. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) He purchased it for his \npersonal use, and he used it once to twice weekly in the evenings, at home, to relax \nafter work and to exercise his civil liberties. He maintained during his February 2022 \nbackground interview that he does not associate with individuals who use drugs \nillegally, and that he has never used marijuana in the presence of others. He intends to \ncontinue to use and purchase marijuana in the future. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) He does not consider \nstopping to be an option. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant denied that he used and purchased marijuana in February 2022, while \nemployed in a sensitive position, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c (Item 1) In his Answer, he \nclaimed that he was not employed in a sensitive position when he used and purchased \nmarijuana in February 2022. The record does not contain any evidence that Applicant \nwas employed in a sensitive position in February 2022. It only reflects that he has been \nsponsored for a public trust position since February 2022. \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.   \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to drug involvement \nand substance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . .\u201d; \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; \u201c(f) \nany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition;\u201d and \u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from 1998 to at \nleast February 2022. He intends to continue to use and purchase marijuana in the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nfuture. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. Although Applicant has been sponsored for \na public trust position since February 2022, the record does not contain any evidence \nthat he was employed in a sensitive position when he used and purchased marijuana in \nFebruary 2022. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. Accordingly, I find SOR \u00b6 1.c in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has used and purchased marijuana for at least 24 years, and he \nintends to continue doing so in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the drug involvement trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

She has never held \na security clearance. She divorced after six years of marriage in July 2022. She earned \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. (Item 3.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, she admits the allegations with \nexplanations. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that from about October 2011, until at least April 2023, Applicant \nused marijuana with varying frequency and that she intended to continue to use marijuana \nin the future. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant from November 2020 until about April 2023, \npurchased marijuana on various occasions. Given the overlapping periods, the \nallegations are addressed together. Applicant in her security clearance interview told the \ninvestigator her marijuana use prior to November 2020 was with friends and her spouse. \nShe did not personally purchase the marijuana but would contribute to someone else\u2019s \npurchase. During this period of her life, she described it as common amongst her friends. \nAfter November 2020 she obtained a medical marijuana card. (Item 4 at 5.) She used \nmarijuana to treat PTSD, depression, and anxiety related to her position in a rehabilitative \ncenter as a physical therapist assistant. During the time period, November 2020 until \nabout April 2023, she had a medical marijuana card and made her purchases at a state-\napproved marijuana dispensary. She used the marijuana to treat her PTSD, depression, \nanxiety, and ADHD. The PTSD developed from her position as a physical therapist \nassistant at a rehabilitative center and the deaths she dealt with during the COVID \npandemic. She has stopped marijuana use because of the security clearance application \nprocess and sought a different treatment plan. \nApplicant has changed her social situation by her divorce and a move to a new \ncity, which resulted in removing people from her life that used marijuana. With her divorce \nand move, she removed herself from the environment where marijuana had been \ncommonplace and there had been pressure to fit in.

(Item 3; Item 4 at 12.) \nApplicant submitted a letter of reference from her current foreman. He cites her \npositive attitude and readiness to work.

(AE C.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n Analysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her SCA and Answer are sufficient to raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \n   (a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nThe question of whether her employment by a business that sells marijuana generates \nany drug involvement disqualifying conditions is more difficult. Her employer and its \nemployees directly handled, possessed, and sold marijuana, and it facilitated its \ndistribution in a state where the cannabis industry was legal under state law, but heavily \nregulated and illegal under federal law. While the federal government would never seek \nto prosecute Applicant, her employer, or any of its employees,  they violated federal law \nas a principal (aider and abettor, accomplice, accessory, co-conspirator). AG \u00b6 25(c) is \napplicable. \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum \nentitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 DNI Memo) which \nmakes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this issue:   \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has cited the 2014 DNI memo in holding that \u201cstate laws \nallowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do not pre-empt \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not bound \nby the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that individual\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 18, 2016).  \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to \napply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant Federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs \nindicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo.)  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c. There is no evidence in the record \nthat Applicant understood her use to be problematic at the time. She had never held a \nsecurity clearance and has aggressively changed her life to remove herself from an \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nenvironment where marijuana was present and sought alternative treatment for her PTSD \nand other mental health issues. The Appeal Board has noted that: \nApplicants cannot be expected to be constitutional law experts or versed in \nthe concept of Federal supremacy. The ambiguity between state and \nFederal drug laws and the ensuing confusion was addressed by the \nSecurity Executive Agent in December 2021 in \u201cClarifying Guidance \nConcerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons \nProposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position\u201d (SecEA Clarifying Guidance). Relevant to the \ntopic of notice, the Guidance encourages employers \u201cto advise prospective \nnational security workforce employees that they should refrain from any \nfuture marijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe [SCA].\u201d SecEA Guidance at 2. Implicit in this guidance is the recognition \nthat the SCA itself no longer puts applicants on notice and that employers \nshould affirmatively be providing notice to prospective employees. The \nSecEA\u2019s guidance to employers, however, cannot be presumed to have \nbeen followed. See ISCR Case No. 23-02476 at 5 (App. Bd. May 1, 2024). \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana occurred over two distinct periods. Her use prior to \nNovember 2020 was with friends and her spouse and after November 2020, when she \nhad a medical marijuana card and used marijuana to treat PTSD. The change in her \nenvironment is significant for both periods. She has changed her treatment program, had \nher medical marijuana canceled, and she quit her position. Her admitted ignorance of the \nlaw under these specific facts shows a rational connection for the choices she has made \nby canceling her medical marijuana card, submitting to two drug tests, and seeking an \nalternative treatment program. Her actions reflect her reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, or regulations. See ISCR Case No. \n20-02974 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c. Applicant voluntarily disclosed her \nactions on her SCA. She fully acknowledges her past actions. She moved and dissociated \nherself from drug-using friends and her former spouse. She quit her position at the \nmarijuana dispensary. She submitted two types of drug tests, which were negative, to \ndemonstrate she no longer uses marijuana. Her Response and observations of her \ntherapist reflect Applicant\u2019s understanding that any future involvement in marijuana is \ngrounds for revocation of a security clearance. \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct no longer casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that she has abstained from illegal drug \ninvolvement for an appropriate period, and that illegal drug involvement is unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant's admissions and \nexplanations, including her explanation for why she started using marijuana. Applicant\u2019s \nstatements in her SCA, security interview, and Response regarding her marijuana \ninvolvement reflect her recognition that she had to stop using marijuana and take control \nof her home environment. The drug tests she submitted, and her therapist\u2019s observations \nsupport her statements that she has changed her life. The observations of her foreman \nreflect she is motivated to make these behavioral changes. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n   Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant received the FORM on April 28, \n2023, and was notified that he had 30 days to file a reply. Applicant did not file a response. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old, married man. He graduated from college in 2010. After \nattending graduate school between 2014 and 2019, he earned a master\u2019s degree and a \ndoctorate. (Item 1 at 11) Since September 2022, he has been working as a technical writer \nfor a defense contractor. (Item 1 at 13) \nApplicant used marijuana recreationally about ten times between 2007 and 2021, as \nalleged in subparagraph 1.a. (Item 4 at 7) At some time in 2021, after being diagnosed with \na chronic arthritis condition, he began purchasing marijuana, as alleged in subparagraph \n1.b, through a physician\u2019s prescription. (Item 1 at 33) Since then, Applicant has been using \nprescription marijuana \u201ca couple of times a week to treat [his] chronic pain.\u201d (Item 3 at 33) \nIn addition to alleviating his chronic arthritis, the medical marijuana helps ameliorate his \ndepression, anxiety, and panic attacks. (Item 3 at 31) He was diagnosed with depression in \n2013. (Item 3 at 31) Applicant intends to continue using marijuana in the future, as alleged \nin subparagraph 1.c. (Item 2 at 1) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance abuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to  comply with laws, rules, and regulations.   \nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance abuse.\u201d His intent to continue using marijuana in the future despite its illegality \nunder federal law triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse.\u201d Marijuana is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances \nAct. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c)) As such, there are no currently accepted medical uses in \ntreatment, and it cannot be dispensed under a prescription. (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(b)(1)(B); \nUnited States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\u2019 Cooperative, 532 U.S. 483, 121 S.Ct. 1711, \n149 L.Ed. 2d 722 (2001)) This is the case regardless of state law to the contrary. \nConsequently, given Applicant\u2019s stated intent to continue using marijuana, none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. I conclude that Applicant has failed to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nIn reaching my decision, I considered the whole-person factors, particularly, \nApplicant\u2019s stated intention to continue the illegal conduct. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He did not disclose he had any delinquent debts, delinquent tax debts, or unfiled tax returns. He was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2022. During the interview, he disclosed that he owed money to the IRS and was delinquent in filing at least one tax years\u2019 return. He said he would file the delinquent return by July 2022. He believed he owed taxes to the IRS for tax years 2008 to 2017, but he could not afford to make a payment plan with the IRS. He said he wanted to pay his tax debt, but his wife had health issues and then lost her job during the COVID pandemic.

He denied the SOR \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g and 1.m through 1.o. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is twice married and has four minor children who do \nnot reside with him. He has some college credits but did not earn a degree. He has worked \nfor his present employer, a federal contractor, since July 2017. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in May 2022. He did not \ndisclose he had any delinquent debts, delinquent tax debts, or unfiled tax returns. He was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in June 2022. During the interview, he disclosed \nthat he owed money to the IRS and was delinquent in filing at least one tax years\u2019 return. \nHe said he would file the delinquent return by July 2022. He believed he owed taxes to \nthe IRS for tax years 2008 to 2017, but he could not afford to make a payment plan with \nthe IRS. He said he wanted to pay his tax debt, but his wife had health issues and then \nlost her job during the COVID pandemic. (Item 4) \nWhen Applicant was confronted with his delinquent debts by the government \ninvestigator he said generally the same thing about each debt, that is he was unaware of \nthe debt, but he would look into it, and contact the creditor. If it was determined that he \nowed the debt, he would set up a payment plan to resolve each debt. (Item 4) \nApplicant answered government interrogatories and was asked to comment on \neach of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h through 1.o. For each debt he noted that it was \nnot paid and he was not making payments. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the question that asked \nif he had any adverse or delinquent accounts, including local, state, or federal tax debts \nthat he currently owed. (Item 5) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2020 and 2021 federal income tax \nreturns (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that Applicant was indebted to the federal government \nfor delinquent taxes for tax years 2012 ($2,989), 2014 ($2,295), 2015 ($1,275), 2016 \n($1,099), 2017 ($1,819), and 2019 ($2,297). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) In Applicant\u2019s SOR \nanswer, he denied these allegations. IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2012 through 2021 \nwere provided as part of the interrogatories. They substantiate Applicant owes the IRS \nfor each tax year as alleged. For tax years 2020 and 2021 the transcripts report that no \ntax returns were filed, but he received a tax credit each year that was applied to balances \nhe owed. These were the tax credits that were authorized as part of the pandemic relief. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has a payment agreement with the IRS \nto satisfy his delinquent tax debts, and he did not provide proof of any payments towards \nthese debts.

(Item 5) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer, statement to a government investigator, \ninterrogatories, tax transcripts, and credit reports from March 2023 and June 2022, \nsupport the SOR allegations. (Items 2-7) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes but may be considered in applying mitigating conditions and in \nwhole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019 federal \nincome tax debt and these debts remain unresolved. He failed to provide evidence that \nhe has filed his 2020 and 2021 federal income tax returns. He has numerous delinquent \ndebts that are not resolved. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action\nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts and tax issues are ongoing and remain unresolved. He did not \nprovide any documentary evidence that he has paid his delinquent federal taxes, made \npayment arrangements with the IRS, or filed his delinquent tax returns. He did not provide \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nproof that he has contacted his creditors, made payment arrangements, or paid any of \nhis delinquent debts. Applicant attributes his financial problems to his wife\u2019s \nunemployment and health issues. These are conditions beyond his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. He did not. His tax \nissues pre-date the pandemic and his wife\u2019s unemployment and health issues. He did not \nprovide evidence he has participated in financial counseling or initiated a good-faith effort \nto resolve his debts. He did not provide evidence of any actions he may have taken to \ndispute his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies but is insufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns. None of the other mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions \nare incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He married his second wife in 2022 and has two minor \nstep-children from this relationship. He was previously married from 2013 through 2022 \nand has three minor children from that relationship. He enlisted on active duty in the Army \nin April 2012. As part of his military service, he served in two combat deployments. In \nabout 2019, he submitted an SCA and was granted a security clearance. Subsequently, \nhis duties in the Army generally required him to have access to classified or sensitive \ninformation. (GX 1-2; AX A; Tr. 8-18, 22-25) \nIn February 2020, while serving overseas, Applicant communicated with a tax \npreparer to submit his joint marital tax returns for tax year 2019. In March 2020, his tax \npreparer requested that he sign and submit a release so that the preparer could submit \nthe tax returns on his behalf. Applicant did not recall signing and returning any such forms. \nHe later figured the tax preparer prepared and submitted the tax return without any \nadditional information. (GX 2; AX B; Tr. 28-32) \nLeading up to this period, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife had deteriorated \nand, a few weeks after communicating with the tax preparer, he filed for divorce. However, \nhe never adjusted his joint tax filing and the tax refund was eventually deposited into his \nindividual account. In May 2020, when his wife discovered this, she complained to \nApplicant\u2019s leadership and alleged that he forged her signature on their 2019 tax returns \nand claimed the refund for himself. Applicant denied forging her signature on any tax \nreturn but admitted that the funds were deposited into his individual account. He stated \nthat he had intended to provide his wife with her share of the refund once he returned \nfrom overseas, in about June or July of 2020. (GX 2; AX B; Tr. 28-32, 50-55) \nNonetheless, Applicant\u2019s leadership began an investigation into his actions. \nUltimately, a general officer memorandum of reprimand (MOR) was issued against \nApplicant. He claimed he felt betrayed by the Army over this action but agreed not to \ncontest the processing of his general discharge under honorable conditions. (GX 2; \nTr. 32-35) \nIn August 2020, while he was pending discharge, Applicant continued to perform \nhis duties. On a Friday or Saturday night that month, he went to a bar to clear his mind. \nHe met a woman and took her home. She brought cocaine and introduced it to Applicant. \nThat weekend, he snorted about four or five lines of cocaine.

However, he decided to try it to relieve the stress of losing his career \nand his marriage. He recognized that this decision exhibited poor judgment. (GX 2; \nTr. 34-37, 60-64) \nOn that following Monday, Applicant was notified that his entire unit was to be drug \ntested. He informed his superiors that he had used cocaine and he subsequently tested \npositive for cocaine. Applicant testified that, because he was already being processed for \ndischarge, his superiors elected not to pursue any additional disciplinary action. In \nSeptember 2020, he received a general discharge under honorable conditions as an E-6, \nstaff sergeant. Under Guideline H, Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine is alleged under SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nHis August 2020 positive drug test is alleged under SOR \u00b6 1.c. His use of cocaine while \nin a position of access to classified information is alleged under SOR \u00b6 1.b. (GX 2; Tr. \n25-29, 60-64) \nAfter a brief period of unemployment, in January 2021, Applicant began working \nwith his security clearance-sponsoring employer as a security professional. As part of the \nhiring process, he was required to take a drug test which came back negative for any \nillegal substances. He is required to hold a security clearance for this position. In August \n2022, Applicant submitted an SCA, as required, to renew his security clearance eligibility. \n(GX 2; Tr. 8, 20, 32-35) \nApplicant testified that he completed his August 2022 SCA on a computer at work \nand that the application prepopulated with information from his prior SCA. Still, he testified \nthat he spent about eight hours on the SCA as he had to update several parts. A review \nof his August 2022 SCA reflects that he updated information about his divorce and \nsubsequent marriage as well as his residential address and employment history. He also \nupdated one of the individuals in \u201cSection 16 \u2013 People Who Know You Well\u201d of his SCA \nand included information about his September 2020 general discharge from the Army \nunder honorable conditions. He did not update the SCA to disclose that he used cocaine \nin August 2020. (GX 1; Tr. 40-44) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege that Applicant falsified his August \n2022 SCA in response to the following questions: \u201cSection 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or \nDrug Activity, Illegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances, In the last seven (7) years, \nhave you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d; and \u201cHave you EVER \nillegally used or otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance other than previously listed?\u201d The SOR alleged that \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to each question and deliberately failed to disclose that \ninformation set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. \nApplicant testified that, during his November 2022 background interview with a \nDOD investigator, he was immediately asked about his drug use. At that time, he provided \ndetails of his encounter with the woman in the bar and his subsequent cocaine use. \nApplicant admitted that he did not know that his positive drug test had been included in \nhis military record. However, he told the investigator that he did not disclose his cocaine \nuse in his August 2022 SCA because he filled out the case papers using a previous form \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat was already in the system.

He told \nthe investigator that he should have paid closer attention to the questions. He denied that \nit was his intention to provide false or misleading answers to the questions. He also told \nthe investigator that he was in a good place in his life and had no intention of using any \nillegal drugs in the future. (GX 2; Tr. 45-52) \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated that, when he was stateside, his duties \nincluded being the Unit Prevention Leader. As such, he received additional training and \nwas required to assist in the administration of the unit\u2019s random drug screenings. He \nfulfilled this role from about 2015 into 2020. As an administrator of the screenings, he was \nalso required to be tested every time drug screenings occurred. He claimed he was \nregularly screened for drugs and never tested positive beyond the single instance in \nAugust 2020. (Tr. 35-38) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted that he failed to list his use of cocaine in his \nAugust 2022 SCA. However, while he acknowledged the omission, he testified that he \ndid not intentionally falsify his application as is alleged in the SOR. He stated, \u201cI didn't \nmake a conscious effort to mark the \u201cno\u201d box because I don't do that every day.\u201d (Tr. 35) \nIn clarifying his statement, Applicant claimed that his previous drug use \u201cwas the last thing \nthat was in my mind. \u2026 I'm not sitting here thinking about a mistake that was made one \ntime in my life.\u201d (Tr. 39) He later stated, \u201cI really didn't even - probably didn't even read \nthe question, just skimmed over it.\u201d (Tr. 49) He also stated, \u201cI figured I would just be able \nto provide an explanation to the federal agent that I met with.\u201d (Tr. 35-39) \nApplicant has not undergone additional drug tests with his employer since his initial \nscreening. However, he continues to take various health-related drug tests through his \nphysician and claims to have never tested positive for an illegal substance. He asserted \nthat his cocaine use was a single event that occurred under uniquely stressful \ncircumstances. He no longer has contact with the woman he met at the bar with whom \nhe used cocaine and does not associate with anyone who uses illegal drugs. (GX 2; Tr. \n32-37, 62-66) \nSince starting with his current employer, Applicant has been promoted on three \noccasions. In December 2023, he became an account manager and is now responsible \nfor monitoring over 50 accounts, some of which involve classified projects. He estimates \nthat he monitors approximately $10 million in funds. (GX 2; Tr. 20-24; 67-69) \nApplicant submitted an NCO Evaluation Report for the rating period from August \n2019 through August 2020, prior to his cocaine use. The report reflected that he either \nexceeded or far exceeded all standards and was considered highly qualified. Rating \nofficials noted that he was \u201cclearly capable of thinking through problems and arrive at \ncreative solutions.\u201d It was also noted that he should be promoted and was capable of \nincreased responsibilities.

All \nthree letters, from senior NCOs in his command, were prepared in June 2020 and predate \nhis use of cocaine. Nonetheless, Master Sergeant L described Applicant as one of the \nbest NCOs he had worked with in his 20-year career. He noted that Applicant was a \ndependable and competent leader. Master Sergeant R stated that Applicant \n\u201cdemonstrated sound judgment and decision-making skills far beyond his age.\u201d \nCommand Sergeant Major F had supervised Applicant for nearly two years when he wrote \nthat Applicant was a \u201cstalwart of professionalism\u201d and an \u201ceasy-going leader.\u201d (AX C) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse under AG \u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted to using cocaine while in the Army in August 2020 and he \nsubsequently tested positive for cocaine. His use occurred while he held a security \nclearance and worked in a position that required access to classified or sensitive \ninformation. All of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn August 2020, Applicant placed himself in a highly compromised position, using \ndrugs with a stranger that he took home. His use occurred during a period of high stress, \nas his Army career was ending and he was in the process of a divorce. He recognized \nthat he exhibited extremely poor judgment. \nFour years have passed since Applicant used cocaine. In that time, he has \nremarried and his personal life has stabilized. He described himself as being in a good \nplace. Additionally, he no longer associates with the individual who he used cocaine with \nor any other individuals who use drugs and he has repeatedly stated his intent to not use \ndrugs in the future. These are all circumstances in favor of mitigation and must be \nweighed against the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s actions. \nHowever, as discussed within the analysis of the SOR allegations under Guideline \nE, Applicant falsified his August 2022 SCA by failing to disclose his drug use. He denied \nthis falsification during his testimony. His inability to be fully transparent about his drug \nuse during the investigatory process continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. As he initially attempted to conceal his drug use from his \nmost recent security investigation, it cannot be said that he fully acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. His lack of candor about his illegal drug use undercuts consideration of \nmitigating evidence here. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn order to prove a deliberate omission within a security clearance application, an \napplicant must have understood the question at issue and must have knowingly failed to \ndisclose the requested information. See ISCR Case No. 21-01570 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, \n2022) In falsification cases, the key issue is usually whether the omission of required \ninformation on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 19-03939 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2023) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations that he falsified two sections \nof his August 2022 SCA by failing to disclose his August 2020 cocaine use. He then \ntestified that his admission was limited to the omission, and not to intentional falsification. \nIn either instance, I conclude that the Government has met its burden to establish that \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his cocaine use was deliberate. \nApplicant was familiar with the process of filling out an SCA in August 2022 as he \ntestified to previously filling out an SCA in 2019. He also testified to spending eight hours \non the SCA while at work and making several substantive updates during that process. \nYet, when asked about the drug-related questions within the SCA, he stated that he \n\u201cprobably didn\u2019t read the question\u201d and that he \u201cjust skimmed over it.\u201d He then claimed \nthat he was not thinking about his drug use at the time he filled out the SCA. However, \nhe also told the investigator that he was unaware that his positive drug test had been \nincluded in his military record. Given the time that Applicant spent filling out the August \n2022 SCA, the extent that he made substantive updates to other parts of the SCA, and \nhis initial belief that his positive drug test was not included in his military record, I find that \nhis omission of cocaine use in his August 2022 SCA was deliberate and that he knowingly \nfailed to disclose the requested information. \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security clearance process relies on those who are trusted with our nation's \nsecrets to be honest and forthcoming regardless of the consequences. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto disclose his cocaine use in his August 2022 SCA is not a minor offense and he did not \nmake a prompt good-faith effort to correct his omission and concealment. While he \nvolunteered details about his cocaine use to the investigator once asked, he has not \nacknowledged his initial effort to conceal that use from his current security clearance \ninvestigation. He further exacerbated that action during his testimony by denying the \nfalsification. He has not taken full responsibility for his conduct. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant served in the Army for over eight years and went on two combat \ndeployments until he received a general discharge under honorable conditions following \nallegations of forgery. He denied those allegations and, even while that matter was \npending, his supervisors and colleagues spoke of his \u201csound judgment\u201d and \n\u201cprofessionalism.\u201d \nHowever, Applicant then chose to exhibit poor judgment in choosing to use \ncocaine. In transferring to civilian life, he again exhibited poor judgment by deliberately \nomitting his drug use history in his most recent SCA. His refusal to acknowledge that \nconduct raises ongoing questions regarding his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant's \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse), and Guideline E (personal conduct). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The DCSA CAS took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn July 24, 2023, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequested a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on August 22, 2023. On \nFebruary 23, 2024, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling the hearing on March 14, 2024. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the \nhearing, I received four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4), 26 exhibits from Applicant \n(Applicant\u2019s exhibit (AE) A through AE Z), and Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nAt the close of the hearing, Department Counsel amended the SOR, adding two \nallegations, as follows: \n1.c. You are indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in the \napproximate amount of $27,463 for tax years 2019 and 2020. As of the date \nof this Statement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid; and \n1.d. You are indebted to the Commonwealth of [State X] for delinquent taxes \nin the approximate amount of $13,892 for tax years 2015 though 2021. As of \nthe date of the Statement of Reasons, the taxes remain unpaid. \nI left the record open for 30 days to allow Applicant the opportunity to respond to the \nAmended SOR and to supplement her exhibits. (Tr. 75) On March 18, 2024, Applicant \nresponded to the Amended SOR, admitting subparagraph 1.c and denying subparagraph \n1.d. In addition, that day, she submitted three additional exhibits that I incorporated into the \nrecord as AE Z through AE BB. On April 4, 2026, Applicant\u2019s counsel moved to extend the \nsubmission deadline to May 7, 2024. Department Counsel did not object, and I granted the \nmotion. On April 26, 2024, Applicant submitted seven exhibits, that I incorporated into the \nrecord as AE CC through AE II, and on May 6, 2024, Applicant submitted an exhibit, \nincorporated into the record as AE JJ, whereupon I closed the record. The transcript was \nreceived on March 22, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 49-year-old married woman with one child, age seven. She earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in the field of computer science in 1998, and a master\u2019s degree in the \nsame field in 2003. (Tr. 14) She works for a defense contractor in the field of information \ntechnology. (Tr. 14) \nApplicant is highly respected on the job. Her supervisor characterizes her as a \n\u201crespected member of [the] team,\u201d and stated that the company is \u201cfortunate to have her \nwork with [them].\u201d (AE R at 21) \nIn 2014, Applicant and her husband separated.

Subsequently, she had to undergo another epidural procedure and suffered two \nblood clots before delivering her child. (AE T) Although the delivery was ultimately \nsuccessful, Applicant developed a severe case of post-partum depression, rendering her \nunable to work or perform basic health care functions for the next six months. (AE T). \nIn January 2017, approximately one month before Applicant delivered her child, her \nhusband was laid off. (AE T at 2) He was unable to regain full-time employment because \nhe had to care for both her and their newborn child. (AE T at 2) Limited to part-time \nemployment and preoccupied with the care of both his immediate and extended family, \nApplicant\u2019s husband failed to file their tax returns. (AE T) \nApplicant received intensive psychotherapy to address her post-partum depression \nbetween August 2017 through June 2022. (AE Y) However, pre-occupied with her illness, \nshe did not file the family\u2019s income tax returns, either. (T. 44) Applicant was aware that she \ncould have filed extensions, but did not because she \u201clost track\u201d of them. (Tr. 56) \nAs Applicant began to gradually feel better, she began reaching out to her \naccountant to file her income tax returns. Her accountant, however, was unresponsive \nbecause she was incapacitated by cancer. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant and her husband then \ninterviewed several different accountants. In August 2021, they retained a new accountant. \n(AE CC) By 2022, with the help of the new accountant, Applicant had filed her delinquent \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016, and by the end of 2023, \nApplicant had filed her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2022. (AE L, \nX) She received federal and state refunds for each year except tax years 2019 and 2020. \n(AE L) For tax year 2019, she owed $22,129 of delinquent federal income taxes and $2,815 \nof delinquent state taxes. (AE L) For tax year 2020, she owed $15,502 in delinquent federal \nincome taxes and $2,198 for delinquent state income taxes. (AE L) \nIn August 2021, Applicant, with her new accountant\u2019s assistance, began filing her \nlate tax returns and paying delinquent tax debts. (AE B; AE U, AE CC) By November 2023, \nshe had filed all her back federal and state tax returns. (AE X) In February 2024, she paid \n$1,300 towards her federal income tax debt. (AE W at 3; AE DD at 1) On March 8, 2024, \nshe filed a request for installment agreement with the IRS. (AE Z) By April 2024, she had \npaid an additional $500 towards her federal income tax delinquency, and she had satisfied \nher state income tax delinquency in its entirety. (AE DD, EE, JJ) \nApplicant currently earns $200,000 annually. (Tr. 14) She has 1.2 million invested in \na retirement account, and $70,000 invested in a money market account.

When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and \nunfavorable, in deciding. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meetings financial obligations.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file or pay federal and state income taxes between 2015 and 2022 \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax, \nas required.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were initially caused by a marital separation. Later, \nthey were compounded by her job loss after they reconciled, and they reached their nadir \nwhen Applicant was disabled by post-partum depression following the birth of her child. \nAlthough circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to Applicant\u2019s failure to file \ntax returns or to pay the corresponding tax debts on time, she did not file her returns for six \nyears. Given the amount of time that elapsed before she filed her income tax returns, I \nconclude that she did not act responsibly enough for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply in its entirety. \nNevertheless, since recovering from post-partum depression, Applicant has retained \na new accountant, filed her tax returns, satisfied the state delinquency in its entirety, and \nhas made $1,800 towards the satisfaction of her federal income tax delinquency. \nConsequently, these facts lead me to conclude that there are \u201cclear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)), and that Applicant \u201cis adhering \nto a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors,\u201d (20(d)). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nApplicant did not file income tax returns for six years, and she just recently began \npaying down her income tax debts. Conversely, the circumstances surrounding her failing \nto file her tax returns were extraordinary and unlikely to recur. Moreover, given her financial \nstability and her emotional stability, having successfully received treatment for post-partum \ndepression, I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant has arranged with the state taxing \nauthority to satisfy her delinquency. As for the federal income tax delinquency, Applicant \ncontacted the IRS, but a plan is not currently in place, as of the date the record closed. \nConversely, Applicant has satisfied the state income taxes entirely, and has made \nsignificant payments towards the satisfaction of her federal income tax delinquency. \nConsequently, although AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply, its inapplicability has no probative \nvalue. In sum, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn addition to the mitigating conditions, I considered Applicant\u2019s strong job \nperformance. Upon considering all of the mitigating and disqualifying conditions in the \ncontext of the whole-person concept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough L were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nMarch 6, 2024. \nI kept the record open after the hearing to enable Applicant to submit documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted a bank record and his military record in series of emails. I \nhave consolidated these into two exhibits AE M (banking screenshot) and AE N (military \nrecords), which were admitted without objection. The record closed on March 12, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admits the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and denies the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b on the basis he paid it in full prior to the SOR being issued. He admits SOR \u00b6 2.a \nwith an explanation. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. \nApplicant is 45 years old. He retired honorably from the Army in 2020. He has \nworked for his sponsor since November 2021 in an overseas position. He worked for \nanother contractor overseas shortly after retirement in a different country from December \n2020 until August 2021. \nApplicant separated from his spouse in July 2019. (Tr. at 22; GE 2 at 2.) He moved \nhis spouse and children from his duty station to another state and initiated divorce \nproceedings in that state. (Tr. at 23.) He has four children. He is required to pay child \nsupport for two of his children who are teenagers and still reside with his former spouse. \nDuring this period, he provided the bulk of their support, approximately $5,500 a month. \nWith his command\u2019s permission he took a part-time job in a department store, so that he \nhad some money to live on. He and his spouse negotiated a lower figure of support. (Tr. \nat 24, 39, 42.) They divorced in January 2021 after over twenty years of marriage. He \nlisted his two adult children on his SCA but not the two children he was responsible for \nproviding child support. His spouse was awarded 35% of his military retirement and he \ntook on all marital debts. He had not planned to retire but given his divorce he felt it was \nthe best thing to do for his family. (Tr. at 27-30; GE 1 at 24, 28-29, 37-38, 41.) \nApplicant\u2019s former spouse did not work outside the home, and he relied on her to \nmanage household finances. When they separated, he began to receive late notices for \nrent, utilities, cable, phones, \u201ceverything.\u201d (Tr. at 38.) He learned of even older \ndelinquencies when these new delinquencies started arriving. (Tr. at 38, 41-42.) When \nthey separated around July of 2019, he discovered his credit score was in the 400s. (Tr. \nat 22.) He began resolving a number of debts prior to the SOR. (Tr. at 42; GE 4 at 3-4.) \nHe used a \u201clittle book\u201d to track everything, and he started making calls to determine what \nwas owed and make a plan to pay the debts. (Tr. at 41.) He was able to get the part-time \njob, restructure the child support amount, and sell the house to improve his financial \nsituation. (Tr. at 42.)

(Tr. at 25; GE 2 at 2.) However, the security clearance process raised his \nawareness to the seriousness that his financial situation had on his employment situation, \nand he started making payments. (Tr. 24-25, 50.) \nHe paid off his former spouse\u2019s car loan and his car loan with his 2023 tax refunds \nand regular income. (Tr. at 25.) He provides support for his children above his obligation \nfor example, phones, extra cash, activities, and to his former spouse to cover travel costs \nassociated with seeing his children, as well as helping his adult children on occasion. (Tr. \nat 53, 92.) He is working to bring his credit score up and states it is now around 690. (Tr. \nat 22.) He makes $126,000 annually now. (Tr. at 36, 54.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Indebted on an account that has been charged off in the \napproximate amount of $31,850. As of the date of this Statement of Reasons, the \naccount remains delinquent. The loan was in Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s names. It \nwas a debt consolidation loan they obtained prior to their separation and subsequent \ndivorce. His spouse stopped making payments after they separated and were living in \ndifferent states. (Tr. at 23, 47; GE 2 at 2.) For the last 11 months he has made regular \npayments of $500 every two weeks after each biweekly paycheck. (Tr. at 25; AE B.) When \nhe learned of the debt he spoke with a financial advisor and was advised since the debt \nwas closed reopening it would weaken his credit score if he wanted to buy a home. (Tr. \nat 24-25; GE 2 at 2.) When the SOR was issued he decided he had to begin making \npayments. He provided AE B through AE K showing his continuous payments. He has \nreduced the debt to about $19,000. He has to renew his payment plan every three months \nbecause the account was closed, and he was not allowed to establish a regular payment \nplan. (Tr. at 51.) He has been saving additional money but given the uncertainty now with \nhis employment situation he has not increased his payments. (Tr. at 25, 50.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Indebted for an account placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $4,582. Applicant provided documentation showing he paid the debt in \nFebruary 2022 prior to the SOR being issued. He explained he had resolved one account \nwith the company but had missed that there was another account. (Tr. at 23, 35, 45, 48; \nAE-A.) \nAs noted above, Applicant has resolved one of the two delinquent accounts, and \nhas provided evidence of ongoing payments for the other alleged debt and the \ngovernment credit report supports his testimony that he resolved other debts related to \nthe marriage. He has taken employment overseas for the past three and half years to get \nhis financial affairs in order. He has been overseas in his current position for the past two \nyears. His employer covers all of his living expenses, even gas for the company supplied \nvehicle.

Applicant admits he falsified material facts on an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), executed August 10, 2022, by \nanswering \u201cYes\" in response to Section 26 -Financial Record- Delinquency Involving \nRoutine Accounts, which asked, in pertinent part, whether \"[i]n the past seven (7) years, \nhe had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency'' or \"any account or credit card \nsuspended charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed\u201d but disclosed only that \ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.b, above. In his Answer he states he unwisely rushed the \nSCA but did not intentionally falsify responses. He told the investigator during his security \ninterview he had forgotten about the debt. He testified when he completed the SCA he \nlooked through for only the open or active accounts on his credit report and did not realize \nat the time that it meant closed accounts as well because they are in fact closed. He was \naware of the debt on his credit report because it was loan, he and his wife had taken out \nto consolidate his debts into one loan to lower the monthly debt payments. (Tr. at 15, 48; \nGE 2 at 2.) He cites that he has never been in trouble during his entire civilian or military \ncareer and that he has held a security clearance for over 20 years. He offered his military \nrecord as evidence of his reliability and trustworthiness. (AE N.) \nDuring his security clearance interview he told the investigator that he was doing \nfine financially and recognized his mistake of not being more involved in his finances. He \ntold the investigator after his divorce he pulled his credit report and paid everything off \nthat he could, and they discussed the financial obligations he had resolved. (GE 2 at 3.) \nHe paid off his car loan and his former spouse\u2019s car loan. (Tr. at 53, 72; GE 2 at 3; AE L.) \nHe has downsized his life, taken jobs overseas, and kept his expenses to a minimum to \nimprove his financial situation. (Tr. at 28, 56.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are fully applicable. Applicant's financial \ndifficulties were incurred as result of his divorce, which was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol and unlikely to recur. He understands now he has duty to monitor his finances and \ncannot rely solely on another to manage the household finances. He has demonstrated \nthrough his actions that he is determined to overcome his indebtedness. He paid one debt \noff prior to the SOR and multiple others that had been neglected. He initially relied on the \nfinancial advice to let the loan drop off his credit report. His actions to reduce this debt \nafter the security clearance process had been initiated are not unreasonable given this \nadvice. He downsized his life, established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and \nhas taken significant action to implement that plan. He knows that regaining financial \nresponsibility is essential to qualify for a security clearance and has taken reasonable and \nmeasured steps to resolve his remaining SOR debt. While he does not present a perfect \ncase in mitigation, perfection is not required. Under the circumstances of this case, I find \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nthat his financial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA his SOR \u00b6 \n1.a debt. Applicant\u2019s admission and the record support that he failed to disclose the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 17(a) is not fully established for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant failed to disclose the information described in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He discussed the \ninformation in detail after being confronted by the investigator. He was aware of his poor \nfinancial situation. He had met with a financial advisor who had recommended he not \nmake payments on this debt and have it remain closed. He had paid off the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b but reported it in his SCA. \nThe mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is established for SOR \u00b6 2.a.

It is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nGuideline E and evaluating all the evidence, noting his excellent military record, in the \ncontext of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor \nof national security, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on \nfinancial considerations and personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:     \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n     Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:     \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n     Subparagraphs 2.a: \n \n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On May 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) This action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 12968, Access to Classified Information, dated August 2, 1995; DoD Manual \n5200.02, Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP), effective on April \n3, 2017 (DoDM 5200.02); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS notified Applicant that it intended \nto deny or revoke his security clearance because it did not find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for him. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines J and E. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) On May 19, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) \nOn August 24, 2023, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the hearing for \nOctober 5, 2023. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s first hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, and \nApplicant did not offer any exhibits. All proffered exhibits were admitted. On October 16, \n2023, DOHA received a transcript of Applicant\u2019s security clearance hearing. On \nNovember 13, 2023, an administrative judge issued her decision in which she concluded \nGuidelines J and E security concerns were not mitigated, and it was not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nOn February 22, 2024, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case. ISCR \nCase No. 23-00656 (App. Bd. Feb. 22, 2024). The Appeal Board concluded: \nThe errors identified above warrant a remand. Based on our review of the \nrecord, we find that the nature of the Judge\u2019s questions at hearing, the focus \nof her decision on non-alleged conduct, and her adverse credibility \ndetermination would cause a reasonable person to question the impartiality \nof the Judge on remand. See USAF-C Case No. 23-00001-R at 7. Given \nthese circumstances, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this \ncase to a different judge. Under Directive E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the \ncase is required to issue a new clearance decision. The Board retains no \njurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision \nissued after remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and \nE3.1.30. (Id. at 10) \nOn March 5, 2024, the case was assigned to me. On March 7, 2024, Applicant \nmoved for a hearing. (HE 6) Department Counsel did not object, and I granted the motion. \nApplicant objected to consideration of the contents of the transcript of the previous \nhearing because the Appeal Board decided she was biased against him, and he was not \nrepresented by counsel at the prior proceeding. I ruled that the record of the previous \nhearing was inadmissible; however, Applicant and Department Counsel could read \nApplicant answers in the transcript to Applicant and cross-examine him about those \nanswers. (Tr. 4-5, 78-80) \nIn March 2024, Department Counsel submitted an amendment to the SOR and \nadded three allegations under Guideline G, and on March 27, 2024, Applicant responded \nto the amendment of the SOR. (HE 4) Applicant requested a delay to prepare to address \nthe additional allegations. (HE 6) The hearing was initially scheduled for April 23, 2024. \n(HE 6) Applicant requested another delay. On April 1, 2024, DOHA issued a Notice \nscheduling the hearing for May 7, 2024. (HE 5) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nAt the May 7, 2024 hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, Applicant \noffered 10 exhibits, and all proffered exhibits were admitted without objection.

Edwards, board-certified psychologist, issued a \nreport regarding Applicant\u2019s mental health, which stated: \nIn September 2023, after alcohol use was raised as a security concern, he \ndecided to stop drinking alcohol and to prioritize his security clearance and \nhis career. He has now been abstinent from alcohol for eight months. This \nwas evidenced by negative random breathalyzer and PEth tests conducted \nin March of this year. I suspect at one time [Applicant] met the DSM-5-TR \ncriteria for Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate. He would now be considered \nto be in full, sustained remission from that condition if he indeed met criteria \nfor it in the past. He never met criteria for any other substance use disorder. \n[Applicant] appeared to me to be an open and forthright person during this \nevaluation. I suspect any discrepancies in his reports about his alcohol use \nare attributable to misremembering or misunderstandings. Regardless, he \ndoes not drink anymore. Instead, he seemed focused on his goals to \ncomplete his education and advance his career. He has many close \nrelationships with family members and friends. He does not associate with \npeople who use drugs or drink too much alcohol. He is engaged in \ncounseling for his own self-development and he is involved in a church-\nbased alcohol treatment program wherein he been trained as a counselor \nin the program. \nCONCLUSION: Based on all the available data, [Applicant] no longer has \nany condition that could negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness, or \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment while working in a cleared setting or around classified information. \nThe risk of relapse into excessive alcohol use is thought to be very low.

(AE F) \nOn May 6, 2024, Applicant said: \nI am submitting this statement of intent to declare that I will continue to \nabstain from alcoholic beverages. \nI will continue not to consume alcohol in the future, and I understand that \nany future involvement with drinking is grounds for revocation of my national \nsecurity eligibility. (AE J) \n[The body of the May 6, 2024 statement of intent to abstain from alcohol \nconsumption says it was executed on \u201cMay 6, 2023\u201d; however, it was \nnotarized on May 6, 2024. (AE J) I concluded this statement of intent to \nabstain from alcohol consumption was effective on May 6, 2024.] \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant provided five character letters from coworkers, which indicate he is an \nexcellent employee. (AE C) The general sense of Applicant\u2019s character evidence is that \nhe is professional, diligent, responsible, reliable, and conscientious. The character \nevidence supports approval of his access to classified information. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern is as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides four personal conduct disqualifying conditions that are relevant \nin this case as follows: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross alleges the allegations of criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.e. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. AG \u00b6 17 provides one personal \nconduct mitigating condition which applies to SOR \u00b6 2.a.

SOR \u00b6 2.a is mitigated for the reasons stated under the criminal conduct \nand alcohol consumption guidelines, infra. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant falsely stated in his April 10, 2023 responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories that he last consumed alcohol in June 2018, which was the month of his \nmost recent DUI offense. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has stated, \u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and \nstate of mind when he executed his Security Clearance Application were relevant \nevidence, but they [are] not binding on the Administrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-\n09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation omitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board recognized the importance of circumstantial \nevidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant said he gave the false answers in his April 10, 2023 response to DOHA \ninterrogatories about his most recent consumption of alcohol being in June 2018 because \nhe was focused on his June 2018 DUI offense; he was rushed when he completed his \nresponses; and he did not intend to mislead DOHA. Applicant described each of the \ncriminal offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e in detail in his SCA and during his OPM \ninterview. He clearly was not attempting to hide or conceal his poor judgment or bad \nbehavior. As to his current alcohol consumption, the OPM summary states that he \ncurrently drinks one or two beers monthly. On April 10, 2023, he certified the accuracy of \nhis OPM summary of interview. Applicant said he had difficulty discerning the meaning of \nwritten information, which may have contributed to his inconsistent answers concerning \nthe currency and recency of his alcohol consumption on April 10, 2023. It is reasonable \nthat he was focused on the June 2018 DUI offense rather than on his current alcohol \nconsumption because that is his the only criminal offense after November 2009. \nMoreover, an applicant may not appreciate the significance and necessity of careful and \naccurate answers to questions about levels and timeliness of alcohol consumption. \nI accept as credible that Applicant\u2019s explanations for his incorrect responses to \nDOHA interrogatories were unintentional mistakes, and that they were not made with \nintent to deceive. He has refuted the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption  \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 lists alcohol consumption conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case including: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes alcohol consumption conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;   \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 31(a), and 31(b) are established.

There is some evidence of the applicability of AG \n\u00b6 22(d) because Dr. Edwards\u2019 medical report said, \u201cI suspect at one time [Applicant] met \nthe DSM-5-TR criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate.\u201d (AE I) AG \u00b6 31(d) is \nestablished because Applicant committed criminal offenses while on probation. The five-\nyear probation orders after the June 2007 DUI are not part of the record, and so there is \nno evidence he violated any alcohol consumption restrictions when he was arrested in \nOctober 2009 for DUI. AG \u00b6 22(g) is not established because the probation orders are \nnot part of the record, and there is no evidence the probation order restricted his alcohol \nconsumption. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), 22(d), and 31(d) will not be considered for disqualification purposes \nbecause they were not alleged in the SOR. However, the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered, stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

These non-SOR allegations will not \nbe considered except for the five purposes listed above. \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIn about June 2007, October 2009, and June 2018, Applicant was arrested for \nDUIs. He was subsequently charged with and convicted of three DUIs. In 2005, he was \narrested for possession of marijuana and methamphetamine. In 2008, he was arrested \nfor possession of marijuana. He admitted the possessions of marijuana in 2005 and 2008. \nHe said he was placed into a diversion program for the methamphetamine offense. He \nadmitted that he committed five criminal offenses (three DUIs and two possessions of \nmarijuana). \nAll of Applicant\u2019s criminal offenses are connected to abuse of alcohol or \npossession of illegal drugs. The drug offenses are not recent because the most recent \noffense occurring in May 2008, 16 years ago. If Applicant can refrain from drinking alcohol \nto intoxication, there is no reason to believe he will engage in future criminal conduct. \nApplicant said he was not ordered to and did not attend an alcohol counseling or \ntreatment program. He attended two alcohol education programs. He is credited with \nsuccessful completion of the probation after his most recent criminal offense in 2018 and \nall other court-ordered requirements. He attended some AA meetings. He acknowledged \nthat he had a problem with alcohol consumption in 2018 when he had his most recent \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDUI. However, he does not consider himself to be an alcoholic because he does not crave \nalcohol and does not suffer from withdrawals. \nAfter 2018, Applicant occasionally consumed moderate amounts of alcohol. He \nhas never received a recommendation that he abstain from consumption of alcohol. There \nis no alcohol in his residence. He does not go to bars. He does not socialize or associate \nwith people who are consuming alcohol. Since November 2023, he has attended \nsubstance-use-related meetings at his church. He has been invited to be an instructor in \nthe alcohol program at his church. He has been abstinent from alcohol consumption since \nSeptember 2023. He intends to continue attendance at the alcohol meetings and to \nremain abstinent from alcohol consumption. He saw a therapist about family issues and \nalcohol consumption; however, his most recent appointment was in September 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder by history is in sustained remission. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s sincere and credible statements about his responsible alcohol consumption \nsince June 2018; his more recent abstention from alcohol consumption since September \n2023; and his promise not to consume alcohol in the future, similar alcohol-related \nincidents such as a DUI are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Applicant took reasonable and responsible \nactions to mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns. He has an excellent \nemployment record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), 32(a), and 32(d) are established. Guidelines G \nand J security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of several variables in considering the whole-person concept \nis required, including the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations. Each case \nis decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and \napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G, J, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old quality assurance inspector.

He provided five \ncharacter letters from coworkers, which indicate he is an excellent employee. He is \nprofessional, diligent, responsible, reliable, and conscientious. There is no evidence of \nviolations of his employer\u2019s rules or that Applicant compromised security. See ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d \nand commenting that security concerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \nIn about June 2007, October 2009, and June 2018, Applicant was arrested for \nDUIs. He was subsequently charged with and convicted of three DUIs. He admitted he \npossessed marijuana in 2005 and May 2008. His BAC for his most recent DUI was .16 or \n.17 percent. He violated probation when he committed additional criminal offenses. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal offenses raised serious security concerns. \nApplicant received alcohol education. After June 2018, he consumed alcohol \nresponsibly, and no additional criminal offenses occurred. He promised not to drink \nalcohol in the future. I am confident he will comply with laws, rules, and regulations. His \nalcohol-related arrests happened under such unusual circumstances that they are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of his SCA, and his extensive \ncriminal history, the following disqualifying conditions could apply: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16 (c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \nAG \u00b6 16 (d)(3): a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation. \nApplicant failed to disclose his past criminal conduct, his list of relatives, and his \nemployment history on his SCA. He also has a demonstrated pattern of dishonesty and \nrule violation, evidenced by his numerous, past criminal charges. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 17 (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17 (b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply. \nApplicant has demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation by his criminal acts \nstretching from 1991 to 2012. Furthermore, he did not make prompt or good-faith efforts \nto correct his falsification or concealment. He provided no information that indicates he \nwas ill-advised in completing his SCA. Falsifying information is a serious offense and \nApplicant has not shown that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. \nFurthermore, he failed to take responsibility for his actions. He has not provided sufficient \ninformation in this record to demonstrate that he has met his burden of proof for his \nadverse personal conduct. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA. This is coupled \nwith a clear pattern of misconduct, from 1991 to 2012, covering a period of over twenty \nyears. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m and1.n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The DOD CAS took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Nat.

He did not disclose \nhis marijuana involvement and his use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance. \n(Item 2 at 24) In his Answer, he explained that he did not disclose his use because it was \nobtained legally and used in a state where it was legal.

Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance abuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to  comply with laws, rules, and regulations.   \nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance abuse.\u201d His intent to continue using marijuana in the future despite its illegality \nunder federal law triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such misuse.\u201d Because Applicant has no intention of stopping his marijuana \nuse, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement security concern. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant\u2019s omission of his marijuana use in response to questions \nabout drug involvement on his 2020 security clearance application raises the question of \nwhether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status \ndetermine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d \napplies. Despite the instruction to disclose marijuana use even if legal under state law, \nApplicant thought that he did not have to disclose his marijuana use because it was legal in \nthe state where he used it. Nevertheless, Applicant disclosed his marijuana use during an \ninvestigative interview conducted two months after completing the security clearance \napplication, during the course of his interview, and later, in his response to interrogatories, \nand his SOR answer. In addition, throughout the investigative process, Applicant readily \ndiscusses his marijuana use, including his intention to keep using it. Given how forthcoming \nhe has been throughout the investigative process, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s omission of \nmarijuana use on his security clearance application was unintentional, and not duplicitous. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. I resolve the Guideline E allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct;(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nBy using marijuana and expressing an intent to continue using marijuana, Applicant \nis violating federal law with impunity. Such nonchalant violation of the law raises \nunanswered questions about whether he would comply with rules and procedures \ngoverning the handling of classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He has one minor child. He graduated high school in \n2007. Since 2021, he has worked as an armed security guard for a government \ncontractor. (Tr. 12-14; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m) totaling \nabout $13,079. Applicant has not made any payment arrangements for any of the SOR \nalleged debts. He stated that after he saves enough money to move, he will contact his \ncreditors to make arrangements. (Tr. 14-43; GE 3, 4, 6) \nApplicants earns about $3,360 monthly and has at least $2,200 in monthly \nexpenses. He stated that he keeps a budget but is horrible with his finances. He claimed \nthat he does not know how to get financial advice. (Tr. 14-43; AE A) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in 2015 for felony \ndomestic violence with assault or battery, domestic violence touch or strike, domestic \nviolence \u2013 intent to do violence and obstruct justice. \nPolice were originally called to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s apartment when Applicant \nbecame physically abusive during an argument. He kicked her TV and broke it. When \npolice arrived, he tried to flee, but was stopped and released with a trespass warning. \n(GE 5) \nApplicant had become aggressive over several days after a male friend called her. \nHe had punched a hole in the bedroom wall. He pushed her and took her car keys away \nand refused to allow her to leave the apartment, and she had to fight him to get away. He \njumped in front of her moving vehicle to stop her from leaving, tried to get in the car, and \nbroke the door handle. Another time, while on the phone with her mother, he slammed \nher phone on the floor, broke it, and would not let her leave the apartment. (GE 5) \nAbout three hours after police issued the trespass warning, Applicant returned to \nthe apartment and broke in. He accused her of having another man with her. When she \nwould not open the door, he tried to climb in through the bathroom window, punched \nthrough the windowpane, and she was cut by glass. Fearing for her life, she fled the \napartment to a local convenience store and called police. When she returned home, she \nwas afraid and unable to sleep that night. The next morning, he returned to the apartment \nand demanded she let him in so they could talk. He became enraged, refused to leave, \nand took her car keys and phone. His mother came to the apartment to get him to leave. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile she was there, he became enraged, threw things, kicked the tv, and damaged a \nwall. He made threats to his ex-girlfriend to knock her teeth out and kill her. She believed \nhis threats and feared for her life. After police were called, he fled and was later arrested. \n(GE 5) \nApplicant was charged with two felonies and two misdemeanors His case was \nnolle prosequi because he entered a pre-trial diversion program. He had to attend a 12-\nweek anger management class, 20 hours of community service, pay fees and a fine, and \nwas told to have no further contact with his ex-girlfriend. Applicant admitted that he broke \nthe last condition, because he had contact with her a few months later. (Tr. 43-49; GE 5) \nAt the hearing, Applicant claimed that he was not physical with his ex-girlfriend. He \nstated that he acted out of character, was immature, and let his emotions get the best of \nhim. (Tr. 14-43) \nIn his July 2022 background interview with a government investigator, when asked \nabout this incident, he became animated with the investigator, raised his voice, and stated \nhe wanted to terminate the interview. He testified he reacted that way because he felt he \nwas being badgered and judged. He asserted he is older and wiser now than at his \ninterview in 2022. At the hearing, when questioned by Department Counsel on the \ncircumstances of the incident, he was obstinate, and his attitude and tone changed \nsignificantly. (Tr. 14-43; GE 2) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his February 2022 SCA \nby failing to report delinquent accounts in Section 26 (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and his 2015 arrest in \nSection 22 (SOR \u00b6 3.b). Applicant stated that he did not disclose the debts on his SCA \nbecause he did not think the information mattered, and he was stupid and foolish for not \ndoing so. He stated that he did not disclose his 2015 arrest because he was told by the \njudge that the charges were dropped to a misdemeanor, and he thought no one would \nsee it. He told the background investigator he did not list the information so he could get \nhired in his current security position. (Tr. 14-43; GE 2) \nApplicant provided four professional character letters, which state he is a good \nemployee, reliable, trustworthy, and has good character (AE B C, D, E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the credit reports \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation showing that any of the alleged debts are being paid, are resolved, or \nbecame delinquent under circumstances that are unlikely to recur.

His behavior \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe criminal conduct security concerns are established by the police and court \nrecords and Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6 31 (b) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. The Government provided sufficient evidence \nto find that Applicant was violent with his ex-girlfriend and committed domestic violence \nin multiple incidents. His versions of events are not credible. He broke the no contact \norder a few months after it was issued. His attitude and tone in his background interview \nand at the hearing show that he has a problem with anger and controlling himself, which \ncreates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Despite the fact he \nentered a pretrial diversion program, this incident is an ongoing security concern. He also \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to find that there has been successful rehabilitation, or \nmitigation by the passage of time or other factors. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026 \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and the following is \npotentially applicable. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to report his financial delinquencies and arrest in the appropriate \nsections of his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNone of the mitigation conditions apply. Applicant knowingly falsified his SCA in \ntwo sections. He concealed relevant information so that he could obtain his security \nposition. He did not provide sufficient evidence to find that the behavior is unlikely to recur, \nand it continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . any disruptive, violent, or \nother inappropriate behavior; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. While public intoxication and unauthorized absence \nfrom work are arguably minor, domestic violence is not. Applicant\u2019s conduct was recent, \nfrequent, and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not fully established. Applicant acknowledged his behavior in his \ninterviews with a security investigator, but he submitted no evidence of counseling, \ntreatment, or other steps to change his behavior. Based on his track record of heavy \ndrinking and domestic violence, I am not persuaded that his criminal behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:   \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant; \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s most recent criminal \nconduct was in September 2021, only a year before he submitted his SCA in September \n2022. He was disciplined for unauthorized absences from work in August 2022, shortly \nbefore submitting his SCA. In the context of his many years of alcohol-related criminal \nconduct, insufficient time has passed to mitigate the concerns raised by his conduct. \nOther than the six court-ordered AA meetings, he submitted no evidence of counseling \nor treatment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol use or \nwhether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s maladaptive alcohol use \nwas recent, frequent, and did not occur under unusual circumstances. While he \nacknowledged his alcohol problems during the interview with the security investigator, he \nhas submitted no evidence of treatment or counseling. He continues to consume alcohol, \nand insufficient time has passed to show an established pattern of modified consumption. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, J, and G in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines E, J, and G and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \npersonal conduct, criminal conduct, and alcohol consumption. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

Furthermore, the documentation from\nthe bank shows that the payments were due to begin in August 2023. No information was\nprovided showing that any of the negotiated payments have been made. (Applicant\nExhibit B.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing $7,445 for a charged-off debt to a third bank. He\nsubmitted documentation showing that he had made a payment arrangement with the\ncreditor. Furthermore, the documentation from the bank shows that the payments were\ndue to begin in August 2023. No information was provided showing that any of the\nnegotiated payments have been made. (Applicant Exhibit A.) This debt is not resolved. \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing $1,257 for another delinquent credit card debt to a \nfourth creditor. He submitted documentation showing that he had made a payment to this \ncreditor for a lower amount. The documentation does not state whether his account is \ncurrent, or this is a negotiated payment for a lesser amount. (Applicant Exhibit C.) This \ndebt is not resolved. \nPolicies \nPositions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases \nforwarded to the DoD and DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel \nManagement. DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures \ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be \nmade. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility for a public \ntrust position, the administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the Adjudicative Guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d), describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a \nnumber of variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable national \nsecurity eligibility decision. \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information or areas seeks to enter \ninto a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. \nThis relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has considerable past-due indebtedness that he had not satisfied when \nthe SOR was issued. These facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing \ndisqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial issues: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAfter issuance of the SOR and receiving the FORM Applicant made payment \narrangements with two of his creditors (SOR 1.b and 1.c). There is no evidence in the \nrecord that any payments have been made. He made a payment to one more creditor for \nan amount that is smaller than his debt (SOR 1.d).

The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided insufficient \nevidence to show that he has resolved his financial issues, or that they will not recur in \nthe future. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has not been reduced. \nOverall, the evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, \nand suitability for a finding of trustworthiness. Applicant has not met his burden to mitigate \nthe trustworthiness concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a public trust position.

Addressing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d, he claimed the creditor \nclosed both of its time-share locations near his home in State A with no updates as to \nwhether the creditor has opened any new locations near his State A home. He further \nclaimed that he is working only part-time in a remote location with no access to \nclassified information. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 67-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GEs 1 and 6) When, however, they \narrived in their current state of residence, they were informed by their timeshare creditor \nthat the company was closing its timeshare location in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. In \nresponse, Applicant and his wife found available rental homes and ceased using the \nresort company\u2019s timeshare space options. (Item 3) \nCiting his inability to use his timeshare homes in his current state of residence, \nApplicant ceased paying on the timeshare loans. (GE 3) Based on his most recent \ncredit report, he made his last payment on his timeshare loans in February 2020 and \ncurrently has delinquent past due balances on the loans in the respective amounts of \n$138,201 and $70,053 (with the increased delinquency balances attributable to \naccumulating interest on the loans). (GE 11) Past demand notices from the creditor, \nwhile acknowledged by Applicant, were never acted upon by him for lack of resources \nto address the loan delinquencies. (Item 3) \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s finances were adversely affected by the COVID-19 \npandemic. (GE 3) In early 2020, a major customer of Applicant\u2019s at an Air Force military \nbase ceased placing orders with his affiliated firm following a COVID-related base \nshutdown. The shutdown caused a considerable loss of income for Applicant and \nprevented him from addressing over $80,000 in personal consumer debts. (Item 3) By \nOctober 2020, the financial losses he had amassed had become serious enough to \nprompt him to retain a debt relief firm. (Item 5) \nUnder the terms of the debt relief program he enrolled in, Applicant agreed to a \nmonthly fee of $1,235 to the debt relief firm in exchange for the firm\u2019s assistance in \nsettling the $82,235 in delinquent accounts he included in his debt relief plan. (Item 5)  \nSince November 2020, Applicant was able to reduce his  enrolled delinquent account \nbalance to $28,003. (Item 5) Applicant\u2019s timeshare delinquencies were not included in \nhis enrolled debt relief plan and remain unresolved and outstanding. (Item 5)  \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n    Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create \njudgment issues over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified \ninformation is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a \nsecurity clearance that entitles the person to access classified information. While the \nprincipal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is \nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases \ninvolving delinquent debts.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR \nCase No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).  \nWithout any documented evidence of Applicant\u2019s addressing and resolving his \ndelinquent timeshare debts with payoffs and payment plans, none of the potentially \navailable mitigating conditions are available to Applicant. In the past, the Appeal Board \nhas consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide documentation \ncorroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the issues relate to \nback taxes or other debts and accounts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s expressed commitments to protecting national security, while \nwelcomed, are not, sufficient to absolve him from continuing security concerns over his \nfailure to provide evidence of his addressing his delinquent accounts and taking the \nnecessary steps to stabilize his finances and otherwise address his accounts in a \nresponsible way. See 17-04110 at 3 (Appeal Bd., Sep. 26, 2019 (citing Directive, Encl. \n2, App A \u00b6 18)  and ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd.

After coordinating schedules with Department Counsel and \nApplicant\u2019s counsel, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing for a video teleconference scheduled for January 17, 2024. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, \nand Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. Applicant objected to GE 4, the \nSeptember 2022 DOD psychological evaluation report, which I overruled as Applicant \nhad voluntarily consented to undergo the DOD psychological evaluation as part of their \nsecurity clearance investigation. All proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \nDepartment Counsel also proffered an October 2023 discovery letter, which I marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) 1, and he requested that I take Administrative Notice of an excerpt \nfrom the DSM-5, which I marked as Administrative Notice (AN) 1 and admitted into the \nrecord. Applicant\u2019s counsel also requested that I take Administrative Notice of AE A and \nAE B, but I noted that AE A was a medical study and the study in the report was \ncontroverted by other medical studies. AE B defined the word \u201chospitalization\u201d, which \ncame from the U.S. government website HealthCare.gov. I told Applicant\u2019s counsel that \nI would take Administrative Notice of their exhibits if they were factual and not subject to \ninterpretation. Therefore, I cannot take Administrative Notice of AE A, the controverted \nmedical study, but I am able to take Administrative Notice of AE B, which is a definition \nof a word. Per the request of Applicant, I held the record open until February 17, 2024, \nso that they could supplement the record with additional documentation. Applicant \ntimely submitted medical records labeled as AE C, which I admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 24, 2024, and \nthe record closed on February 18, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: Applicant is 24 years old. Before their college graduation in the Spring \nof 2021, they started an internship in November 2019 with a government contractor. \nThey were required to apply for a DOD security clearance. After they graduated with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, the government contractor offered them full-\ntime employment as a software engineer. Applicant identified as a trans man from their \nsophomore year in high school and during their first two years into college. They now \nconsider themselves demisexual. Demisexuality is a sexual orientation in which a \nperson feels sexually attracted to someone only after they have developed a close \nemotional \nbond \nwith \nthem. \n(https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22678-\ndemisexuality) They currently cohabitate with their partner, and they do not have any \nchildren.

Applicant did not feel safe living with their mother, and they had to watch over \ntheir two younger siblings because they were neglected by their mother as well. (Tr. 26-\n29)  \nWhen Applicant was 12 years old, they suffered from a depressive episode which \nrequired inpatient treatment. When asked how this situation developed, Applicant stated \nthat another student had looked at their artwork without permission, and due to the \ngraphic nature of Applicant\u2019s artwork, the student reported it to school officials. \nApplicant testified, \u201cI had some art of my ghost getting back at my bullies, and while, \nyes, the art was violent, no one was really listening or understanding that I was having \nissues at school. And I had no intentions of ever harming someone; it was just the only \nway for me to get my frustrations out.\u201d They had to meet with a social worker, who then \ntold Applicant\u2019s father they needed to have a mental health evaluation. They were \nreferred for inpatient treatment from approximately February 2012 through March 2012 \nfor a condition diagnosed as depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. They were \nprescribed medication. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) (GE 1; Tr. 30-34) \nApplicant continued to receive mental health counseling and medication \nthroughout their high school years, but it was not consistent. When they were the age of \n14, they half-heartedly attempted to hang themselves with the belt from their bathrobe \nafter performing poorly on a test, and on another occasion, they put a plastic bag over \ntheir head but did not tie it closed. On both occasions, they stopped their actions \nbecause they did not like the way it made them feel. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) At some \npoint during this time they were diagnosed with bipolar disorder, anxiety, and \ndepression. In 2016, their mother died from complications related to excessive alcohol \nuse when they were 16 years old. (GE 1; Tr. 30-35; GE 3) \nFrom approximately November 2019 to December 2019, Applicant received \npartial outpatient treatment for a condition diagnosed as major depressive disorder \u2013 \nsevere. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) They were enrolled in college at the time and feeling extreme \npressure from the college assignments and the notion that they had to excel in \nacademics that was impressed upon them since childhood. They voluntarily referred \nthemselves for treatment. After the partial outpatient treatment program was completed, \nthey continued to see a therapist, a new psychiatrist, and they continued taking \nmedication. The treatment records reflect there were times they did not take the \nmedication as prescribed. (Tr. 35-38; GE 2; GE 3) \nDuring the course of Applicant\u2019s security clearance investigation, the DCSA CAS \nrequested Applicant to voluntarily undergo a psychological evaluation. They consented \nto the evaluation, and in September 2022 they met with the licensed clinical \npsychologist. The evaluation took three hours out of the four hours allotted. During the \nevaluation Applicant felt like the questions were based on preconceived notions about \nthem, and the mental health professional seemed more concerned about their history \nrather than their current treatment and progress.

They have been feeling remarkably better since November 2022 when they \nstarted seeing a new therapist and after going through a complete \u201cmed wash\u201d under \nthe supervision of their psychiatrist. The medications they had been taking made them \nviolently ill and also kept them in a state of mental fog. The new therapist has been \nmore challenging by setting specific goals and has been more involved in helping them \nimprove, rather than just listening to their thoughts and concerns like their former \ntherapist. (Tr. 41-45) \nApplicant and their psychiatrist worked together during their med wash, and the \nplan was to eliminate all medications, and then slowly add medications when \nnecessary. No new medications have ever been added. They have been completely \nfree from medications for over a year now. Applicant stated: \nI believe that not having the medications has allowed me more opportunity \nto help my mental health conditions and confront the feelings that I feel in \ntherapy a lot better, as some of the medications were merely helping me \nget by and masking the symptoms instead of allowing me to confront \nthem. Now that I'm not taking medications, I'm more in tune with how I feel \nand how I can better cope with those in therapy. (Tr. 45-46) \nApplicant provided a medical study showing that antidepressants are a potential \ncause of suicidal ideations or behavior. (AE A) They also submitted their current \ntreatment records. In May 2021 neuropsychiatric testing results showed Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, without intellectual or language impairment, and \nmajor depressive disorder. The test results did not conclude a diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder. The psychiatrist, therapist, and the certified physician assistant have updated \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis to major depressive disorder, in full remission. Applicant has been \nseeing their therapist on a weekly basis since November 2022. The therapist reported \nthat since medications were discontinued in January 2023, there have not been any \nmajor depressive-type systems, and the patient appeared to be doing better than when \nthey were treated with medications. The patient reported their mental health symptoms \nhave not impaired their daily functioning, and they have built sufficient coping strategies \nto maintain stability. Based on patient reports and clinical observation, Applicant has \ndemonstrated improvements in their overall insight and judgment/impulse control. \nApplicant continues to participate in weekly therapy sessions to the current time and is \nfully compliant with their treatment plan.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern for psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \nThe medical diagnoses and records in evidence raised the following \nPsychological Conditions Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient treatment; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a)-(c) have been established by the facts of this case. AG \u00b6 28(d) has \nnot been fully established by direct, clear evidence of a treatment plan that Applicant \nhas failed to follow. Due to Applicant\u2019s dislike and ill side effects of the various \nmedications that have been prescribed for them throughout the years, they have not \nconsistently taken the medications as prescribed. Since January 2023, in accordance \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith medical advice, Applicant is not presently taking any medication for their mental \nhealth condition. The treatment record reports the patient\u2019s positive progress since they \nwere weaned from the medication by their psychiatrist. \nI considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: [adjust margins] \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd.

Based on her overall \nassessment, the psychologist found that Applicant had psychological conditions which \ncould impair their judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nApplicant had a difficult childhood. As a 12-year-old, Applicant was evaluated \nand referred for inpatient treatment. It is clear from their testimony and medical records \nthat they predominantly suffered from depressive symptoms throughout their high \nschool and young adult years. \nIn November 2022, Applicant started treatment with a new mental health \nprofessional and currently continues treatment on a weekly basis. In conjunction with \ntheir psychiatrist, physician assistant, and therapist, Applicant was slowly weaned from \nall medications. The plan was to put them on medication when their symptoms required \nit, but since January 2023, Applicant has remained medication-free. The current \ntreatment records reflect that Applicant has improved, and their current diagnosis is \nautism spectrum disorder, and major depressive disorder, in full remission. Applicant is \ncurrently participating in treatment, and they are compliant with their treatment plan. The \ncurrent medical and mental health staff have provided a favorable prognosis as recently \nas February 2024. Applicant successfully mitigated the psychological conditions security \nconcerns. \n  Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is doing well in treatment, and they are compliant with their treatment \nplan.

He is not married and does not have any children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, and a graduate degree in 2022. Shortly after obtaining his undergraduate degree, he was hired by CA as an aerospace engineer. His employment with this government contractor ended in January 2020. His current employer, another government contractor, is currently sponsoring him for a DOD security clearance. (GE 1; AE A) SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d alleges that in about March 2020, Applicant was debarred from government employment with a government agency (GA) for three years after he was found unsuitable based on misconduct and negligence in a prior employment, and falsifying background investigative documents. Applicant admitted this allegation, with the same qualifications as indicated in his Answer. (Tr. 12; Answer) Applicant testified that while he was in college in 2016, he was working for a restaurant as a server. On his second to last day in this employment, he had served a customer who had not tipped him. Applicant politely told the customer that he had essentially paid money to serve the customer because Applicant had to pay the restaurant support staff a percentage of his net sales at the end of his shift.

(Answer) \nOn January 18, 2024, Department Counsel issued a Ready to Proceed \nmemorandum for this case. On February 2, 2024, the case was assigned to me. All \nparties agreed to proceed with the hearing on May 8, 2024. On March 15, 2024, DOHA \nissued the hearing notice. \nOn April 10, 2024, an email was issued notifying Applicant and me that another \nDepartment Counsel had been reassigned to this case. In addition, the new Department \nCounsel provided notice that additional information was forthcoming, and that the \nGovernment intended to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR). \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, and submitted a disclosure letter dated January 18, 2024, I marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) 1. The Government also called two witnesses to testify. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C (and the documents previously \nprovided with the Answer), and four witnesses were called to testify on behalf of \nApplicant. The hearing was not completed by the end of the day on May 8, 2024, and \nwith all parties in agreement, I continued the hearing to May 14, 2024. All proffered \nexhibits were entered into evidence without objection. (Transcript (Tr.) 179) \nDOHA received the May 8, 2024 hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 15, 2024, and \nthe May 14, 2024 hearing transcript was received on May 21, 2024 (Tr. #2). \nEvidentiary Rulings \nOn April 11, 2024, Department Counsel sent the first amendment to the SOR. \nThe original SOR alleged four allegations under Guideline E, and the amended SOR \nalleged an additional four allegations under Guideline E, and Guideline M was added \nwith one allegation. Department Counsel stated that due to the new information, the \nGovernment would not object if Applicant requested a continuance. No response was \nreceived from Applicant, and on April 16, 2024, Department Counsel requested that I \nissue an order to have Applicant respond to the amended SOR by April 24, 2024. On \nthat same day, I asked Applicant\u2019s attorney (Counsel) if his client intended to respond to \nthe Amended SOR by April 24, 2024. \nOn April 17, 2024, Counsel objected to the Government\u2019s proposed amendment \nto the SOR stating that the Government had ample time to formulate the SOR and \nunreasonably withheld the supporting evidence for their amended SOR. His position \nwas that the amended SOR did not address new or different acts, but rather it realleged \nand expounded on conduct already included in the original SOR.

Department Counsel also stated \nthat he would transmit supporting information to Counsel after I issued a case \nmanagement order. Counsel objected to the addition of subparagraph 2.b., as it was \n\u201cthe same, word-for-word, as the previously amended [sub]paragraph 2.a.\u201d I found \nCounsel\u2019s assertion incorrect. SOR \u00b6 2.a. referred to the [Government Agency (GA)] \nissued laptop, and \u00b6 2.b. referred to the [Contractor A (CA)] issued laptop. The second \namendment to the SOR was sent to Applicant\u2019s Counsel 20 days before the hearing \nwas held. Applicant had adequate time to answer the new SOR allegations and \ndeclined a request for a continuance. There is no reason to conclude that \nApplicant was prejudiced by any purported changes in the amended SOR. \nOn April 18, 2024, I issued an Order in this case and directed Department \nCounsel to immediately send all supporting documents for the second amended SOR to \nApplicant. Per the DOD Directive, I allowed the second amendment to the SOR, and I \nordered Applicant to admit or deny each and every SOR allegation, which I put on the \nrecord during the May 8, 2024 hearing. (Tr. 10-12) \nOn May 5, 2024, three days before the hearing, Counsel reported that one of the \nGovernment witnesses had contacted a witness for Applicant and discussed information \nabout a proposed AE, and this misconduct could implicate 18 U.S.C. 1505 and the \nPrivacy Act. Counsel requested I admonish Department Counsel to withhold Privacy Act \nprotected records from Government witnesses, and to advise their witnesses not to \ncontact any other witnesses in the case. Department Counsel responded to Counsel\u2019s \nemail and admitted that a document, in which both witnesses\u2019 conversations were \nsurreptitiously recorded by Applicant and then made into a transcript, had been \nprovided to the Government witness for hearing preparation. Department Counsel also \nstated he could not control any witness, and if the witness contacted another witness, it \nwas not by the Government\u2019s direction, nor was the Government aware. After learning \nof the contact, Department Counsel asked the witness not to discuss the matter with \nothers moving forward. He denied the conduct violated 18 U.S.C. 1505 or the Privacy \nAct, as claimed. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel also requested that, based on the misconduct of the \nGovernment\u2019s witness, I accept a list of facts for which Applicant\u2019s witness was (but no \nlonger) going to provide in a character reference letter for Applicant. Department \nCounsel objected to this request and asked that this matter be addressed during the \nhearing and on the record. I agreed with Department Counsel\u2019s request and withheld \nany ruling until the matter was addressed during the hearing and recorded on the \nrecord. During the hearing, Department Counsel also requested that I make an adverse \ninference against the party whose witness, having learned the full facts, subsequently \nwithdrew their endorsement of Applicant.

She had contacted the other witness, without the Government\u2019s knowledge, to ask \nif she was aware that Applicant had covertly recorded both of them during Applicant\u2019s \nmeeting held in late January 2020, and that he had made a transcript of the meeting. \nApplicant\u2019s witness had no knowledge that she had been recorded without permission, \nand she was not happy about it. As such, Applicant\u2019s witness declined to provide \nApplicant a letter of recommendation, as previously arranged. The Government witness \nwas not acting in a corrupt or threatening manner to influence, obstruct, or impede a \nproceeding when she contacted Applicant\u2019s witness. I also ruled that I would not agree \nto make an adverse inference of any witness in the case, nor would I accept as fact \nwhat Applicant\u2019s witness was purportedly going to provide in her letter of \nrecommendation. (Tr. #2 115-119) \nFindings of Fact \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, I make the following \nfindings of fact: Applicant is 28 years old. He is not married and does not have any \nchildren. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, and a graduate degree in 2022. \nShortly after obtaining his undergraduate degree, he was hired by CA as an aerospace \nengineer. His employment with this government contractor ended in January 2020. His \ncurrent employer, another government contractor, is currently sponsoring him for a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (GE 1; AE A) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.d alleges that in about March 2020, Applicant was debarred \nfrom government employment with a government agency (GA) for three years after he \nwas found unsuitable based on misconduct and negligence in a prior employment, and \nfalsifying background investigative documents. Applicant admitted this allegation, with \nthe same qualifications as indicated in his Answer. (Tr. 12; Answer) \nApplicant testified that while he was in college in 2016, he was working for a \nrestaurant as a server. On his second to last day in this employment, he had served a \ncustomer who had not tipped him. Applicant politely told the customer that he had \nessentially paid money to serve the customer because Applicant had to pay the \nrestaurant support staff a percentage of his net sales at the end of his shift. The \ncustomer complained to the restaurant manager, who apologized and gave the \ncustomer a gift certificate. At that point, Applicant decided he was going to quit this job \nbecause the manager did not support him, and this employer was also unwilling to work \nwith his academic schedule. The next day he met with the manager and was required to \nfill out an incident report. Applicant then told the manager he quit. When he applied for \nemployment with a GA, he submitted a background investigative application and listed \nthat he had resigned from the restaurant employment position. During the course of \nApplicant\u2019s investigation conducted in 2022 for employment, the GA discovered that he \nhad been fired by this employer, which came as a surprise to Applicant.

He even submitted a \nFreedom of Information Act request, but it did not offer any clarification. The GA letter, \nin the record, disclosed there were two reasons why Applicant was considered \nunsuitable for employment: (1) issues related to a pattern of misconduct or negligence \nin employment (unemployability), and (2) issues related to dishonest conduct. An \nenclosure came with the GA letter which stated: \nCharge #1: In May 2016, you were terminated after a month of \nemployment from [restaurant] for having a disagreement with a \ncustomer. In January 2020, you were terminated from CA for an issue \nthat required a confidentiality agreement between you and your \nleadership.

I was not \ngiven a reason for the termination due to [location redacted] or just \n[location] being an At-Will district.

You failed to list that you had \nbeen terminated from [restaurant] in May 2016 for having a \ndisagreement with a customer. (Answer attachment) \nApplicant provided an undated response to Charge #1 concerning his server \nemployment with a restaurant, which stated, in part; \u201cAt no point was I told that I was \nfired, was going to be fired, or left by mutual agreement (emphasis added) which is \nwhy I did not include this in Question 12 on my OF-306.\u201d In his response to Charge #2, \nhe listed, in part; \u201cDue to the terms of the confidentiality agreement I am unable to \nfurther elaborate on my employment with [CA] other than my employment dates and \nthat it was an amicable separation for both parties.\u201d (Answer attachment) \nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, Applicant listed on his November 2021 e-QIP in \nresponse to a question; \u201cGovernment Debarment \u2013 Have you EVER been debarred \nfrom government employment?\u201d He answered \u201cyes\u201d and listed that he had been \ndebarred in 2020 for three years. He made a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) \nrequest, but he was unable to find out why he was considered unsuitable for \nemployment with GA.

(GE 1) \nApplicant listed information on his November 2021 e-QIP under the employment \nsection that he was \u201cfired\u201d in May 2016 after he \u201cconfronted a customer for leaving no \ntip.\u201d During Applicant\u2019s background interview conducted in January 2022, he told the \ninvestigator that following that incident, he and his manager had a conversation. \nApplicant told his manager he quit at the same time his manager told him he was \nfired due to violation of company policy. (Emphasis added) This information \ncontradicted with Applicant\u2019s undated response to the GA employment debarment, in \nwhich he stated, \u201cAt no point was I told that I was fired, was going to be fired, or \nleft by mutual agreement\u2026 (emphasis added.) (GE 1, 2; Answer attachment) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was terminated by CA in January \n2020 for engaging in inappropriate conduct and disobeying directions from superiors. \nExamples of these behaviors include falsifying time and attendance records, engaging \nin unapproved telework, and displaying disrespectful behavior toward coworkers, \nclients, and others. Applicant denied this allegation. He did admit, however, that he did \nengage in unapproved telework. (Tr. 10-11; Tr. #2 55-57; AE A; Answer) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.b alleges that during Applicant\u2019s one and one-half years of \nemployment at CA, he engaged in inappropriate conduct and disobeyed directions from \nsuperiors. Examples of these behaviors include falsifying time and attendance records, \nengaging in unapproved telework, and displaying disrespectful behavior toward \ncoworkers, clients, and others. Applicant denied all but the unapproved telework \nreference, with the same qualifications provided in his original Answer. (Tr. 11; Tr. #2 \n55-57; Answer) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant was recommended for removal from \nhis assignment with GA during his employment with CA for falsifying his time and \nattendance and other behavioral issues. Applicant denied this allegation. (Tr.12) \nBefore graduating from college, Applicant reached out to the chief executive \nofficer (CEO), president and owner of CA, who was also a fraternity brother, and asked \nabout employment opportunities. Applicant was offered employment in approximately \nJune 2018 with a starting salary of $71,000. CA was a company that contracted with a \nGA to provide support. Although Applicant was hired as an aerospace engineer, he was \nnot performing aerospace engineer job duties working for CA. (Tr. 65, 159, 176; Tr. #2 \n18-19, 52-54) \nApplicant stated that when he was hired at CA, he was allowed to telework on \nFridays. He admitted that he would telework, on average, an additional three days a \nweek without authorization. He admitted that he was eventually confronted by his CA \nsupervisor and his GA supervisor for his unapproved telework.

Applicant admitted, however, \nthat he continued to engage in unapproved telework, but less frequently. (Tr. #2 55-57, \n158) \nP testified as a witness for the Government. She had retired from GA after \nworking 32 years, and then returned to work as a consultant for CA in 2014. She met \nApplicant when he was hired in June 2018. The president of the company told her she \nwould be Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor. Applicant was issued a company laptop. Over \ntime, she found Applicant difficult to work with as he repeatedly complained about the \njob and failed to follow directions. P believed Applicant had trouble accepting job duties \nthat he thought were beneath him, and he would also argue with CA\u2019s customer about \nhis responsibilities. She tried to counsel him since he had just graduated from college \nand this was new to him, but over time she realized that he was not mature enough to \ndo what was expected of him. At one point he told P that she \u201cwasn\u2019t his mother\u201d and he \ndid not like being treated like a child. P believed this comment was demeaning and \ncondescending. (Tr. 86-94) \nApplicant admitted that he had told P to stop acting like his mother, but he did not \nbelieve it was demeaning or condescending. He said his statement was taken out of \ncontext. Applicant is fine when receiving life advice from his own mother, and this \nstatement was made to reassure P that she did not need to fill that void in his life. (Tr.#2 \n60-62) \nP stated that since Applicant was a fraternity brother with the CEO of the \ncompany, he would often go around her and take his complaints directly to the CEO. \nThe CEO would then call P and ask her why Applicant was contacting him when he \nshould be reporting to her, Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor. P explained to Applicant that \nhe had to report his concerns through the chain of command, which started with her. \nDespite this guidance, Applicant continued to contact the CEO directly with his \ncomplaints and concerns. Before Applicant started employment in 2018, P would \ngenerally talk to the CEO once a month or every six weeks to check in. After Applicant \nwas hired, P and the CEO were talking on a weekly basis, \u201csometimes hours on end \ninto the evening,\u201d trying to address the best way to handle Applicant. (Tr. 86-94, 176) \nApplicant was assigned to work with \u201cJ,\u201d an employee of CA\u2019s customer. J \ntestified as a witness for the Government. J has worked for the GA for 34 years, and his \ncurrent job title is program manager. In 2018, J was supporting several contracts, and \nCA asked him if he would consider using Applicant to support a specific government \ncontract. Applicant was hired to directly support J, and all of Applicant\u2019s work-related \ndirections came from J. Applicant was issued a GA laptop. Within the first 90 days of his \nemployment supporting CA\u2019s customer, J began to experience problems with Applicant. \nJ sent him emails with \u201ccall me when you get in\u201d in the subject line so that Applicant \nwould see the message without opening the email. J would expect to receive a return \nphone call anywhere between 6:00-8:00 a.m., but there were times when Applicant did \nnot return his call at all that day, or it would be noon or later before he made the call.

(Tr. 33-46, 50, 65-68, \n70, 72-73, 95-96, 101, 103-104, 106-107, 111-114; GE 3) \nJ soon discovered that Applicant was not reporting to the CA office for the four \ndays of the week he was supposed to be there. J worked out in the field the majority of \nthe time, but he would occasionally come into the CA office unannounced. Applicant \nwould claim he was working at the CA office when he was not there. J started going to \nthe CA office more frequently to see if Applicant was at the office. There were also \ntimes J would call other workers at the CA office and ask them if Applicant was in the \nbuilding during his scheduled work hours. Frequently he learned that Applicant had not \nreported to the CA office that day, but Applicant claimed otherwise. J called Applicant\u2019s \nfirst-line supervisor, P, and reported that Applicant had committed timecard fraud, was \ntaking unapproved telework, and he had falsified government documents. J asked P to \nhave Applicant replaced because he could no longer trust him. P, acting as an \nintermediary between CA\u2019s customer and Applicant, worked to resolve the conflict. A \njoint decision was made that Applicant would get a second chance, but he was no \nlonger to report to the CA building; he would now report to P\u2019s cubicle at the GA building \nso she could keep an eye on him. Applicant\u2019s telework privileges were discontinued for \n90 days. For the next 90 days, P saw Applicant on almost a daily basis at work unless \nshe was on travel. Applicant was also required to make regular rounds around the office \nso that he would be seen by others and could answer any questions about the \ngovernment contract he was supporting. (Tr. 33-46, 50, 65-68, 70, 72-73, 95-96, 101, \n103-104, 106-107, 111-114; GE 3) \nJ testified that Applicant was also disrespectful and repeatedly failed to follow \ndirections from him. J would upload a file to a specific site, but he later found out that \nApplicant had taken down the file, made changes to the telecon minutes, and then \nsometimes reposted the edited file to the site. J told him to immediately \u201ccease and \ndesist\u201d from manipulating any file in which Applicant was not a telecon participant. \nApplicant continued to disregard J\u2019s direction, and J finally sent an email to CA asking \nthem to instruct Applicant to follow his directions. He stated that Applicant also ignored \nCA\u2019s instructions. In addition, Applicant was making changes to slides that he was \nspecifically told not to touch, and he was issuing directions to other government \nworkers, as a support employee to the GA and without copying J on the email. In 2020, \nP called J to let him know Applicant had filed a complaint against him with the GA \nAccountability Board. Around that time J also received an email that Applicant was to \nreport directly to J\u2019s boss, and J would no longer interact with Applicant. J never heard \nback from the Accountability Board about Applicant\u2019s complaint. J explained that when \nthe board receives a complaint, they review the substance of the complaint, and if it is \nfound to be meritless, no investigation ensues. J provided email communications to \nsupport his testimony. (GE 3; Tr. 34, 46-50, 53-60, 66-67, 74-79, 94, 110; GE 3) \nApplicant explained the reason he had taken down files J had previously \nuploaded on a specific site was due to his responsibility to manage that site. Even \nthough he was not a telecon participant in some of the meeting minutes, he had a \ntemplate and tried to keep all of the minutes in a uniform and consistent manner.

He denied that he had changed \nthe content of the file. He was told not to work on the site again or report to J near the \nend of his employment with CA. He denied that he was counseled or reprimanded for \nthis conduct. (Tr. 30-32) \nP testified that after seeing no improvement in Applicant\u2019s work ethic, she \nrecommended to the CEO that Applicant be fired. The CEO eventually agreed it was \ntime to let him go. Applicant\u2019s unauthorized deletion of their customer\u2019s files from a \nspecific site was the tipping point. The CEO did not want to ruin Applicant\u2019s future \nemployment potential, so an agreement was made that his termination was not \ndisciplinary, but rather an amicable separation, which would also allow Applicant to \nreceive unemployment benefits. In late January 2020, Applicant was called into a \nmeeting with three other CA employees to sign a severance package agreement. \nApplicant believed he was invited to a January 2020 meeting to go over his job \nduties. He did not know beforehand that he was going to be terminated from \nemployment with CA. Before the meeting started, he spotted the CA vice president in \nthe hallway. She lived out of state, and since there was no announcement made about \nthe vice president\u2019s visit or an office luncheon scheduled, which was the usual protocol, \nApplicant got a bad feeling about his upcoming meeting. He decided to use his Apple \nwatch to secretly record the meeting for his own protection. When he reported to the \nmeeting, the CA vice president said, \u201cI bet you\u2019re surprised to see us here.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nreply was, \u201cNo, not really,\u201d because he realized the purpose of the meeting. At some \npoint before this hearing, Applicant made a transcript of the meeting that he secretly \nrecorded, and submitted it as AE A. (GE 4; Tr.110, 115-120, 133) \nP testified that Applicant was told specifically during the meeting that he was \nbeing fired due to not providing good support to their customer, removing without \nauthorization the customer\u2019s files from the specific site, insubordination, inappropriate \nbehavior, unapproved telework and for falsifying his timecards and attendance. P, who \nwas present during the meeting, read the transcript and found it to be about 90% \naccurate. She remembered a few topics that were discussed during the meeting that \nwere not found in the transcript. She noticed the transcript did not fully address the \nseverance package details that were discussed; the transcript lacked discussion of the \nspecific inappropriate interactions Applicant had with J; and she also remembered \ntelling Applicant that he needed to turn-in his CA laptop that day, and \u201che was not to \ndelete anything on that computer.\u201d She believed that information was discussed with \nApplicant during the January 2020 meeting, but it was not found in the transcript. (AE A; \nGE 4; Tr.110, 115-120, 122-133, 163-164, 173-174) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was not terminated from CA, and he \nwas never counseled for falsifying time. He did engage in unapproved telework because \ntelework was a common practice for CA employees. When he did report to the CA \noffice, he found it was expensive for him to travel there from his residence. He was also \nin a bad mental state because he had moved from another state and did not know \nanyone at this new location. His CA desk was isolated in a basement.

He admitted \nthat he was eventually placed next to P\u2019s desk for about four weeks, and that he had \nbeen told by her in a conversation, not counseled or reprimanded, that he was not \nallowed to telework. During cross examination, Applicant admitted that he took the \nconversation seriously when P told him he was breaking the rules by his continued \nunapproved telework. (Tr. #2 24-28; 55-58) \nThe January 2020 meeting transcript, provided as AE A, listed a conversation \nbetween the CA vice president and Applicant. It stated: \nVP: Okay. So that\u2019s the severance package we\u2019re offering you. The \nseverance package has to be signed today for it to go through. \nApplicant: It says I can consult a lawyer. \nVP: You can take it signed to an attorney. But we need it signed because \nit\u2019s saying that you won\u2019t talk to anyone, our clients past or present. I can \ngive it to you with me signing it and making a copy. If you don\u2019t want to \nsign it, I can give you just a memo with the termination. So that choice is \nyours.  (AE A page 3) \nFrom the conversation above, the agreement was provided to Applicant as a \nresignation in lieu of termination. \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his \nNovember 2021 e-QIP in response to \u201cSection 13A \u2013 Employment Activities 5. [CA], \nOptional Comment;\u201d in which he listed his direct supervisor was [\u201cP\u201d], but he did not \nhave many interactions with her. He mainly interacted with the vice president of CA. In \ntruth, Applicant had regular interaction with P. Applicant denied this allegation. He \ntestified that he may have had one or two dozen conversations with P during the course \nof 18 months of employment. P testified that as Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor at CA, she \nhad regular and continuing contact with Applicant. (Tr. 12, 161; Tr. #2 33-35; AE A) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his \nNovember 2021 e-QIP in response to \u201cSection 13A \u2013 Employment Activities 5. [CA] \nReason for Leaving \u2013 Summary, 1. Left by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance.

Applicant denied this allegation. He testified that \nduring the January 2020 meeting he had asked two or three times the reason why he \nwas being terminated, but he never received a valid response. The participants in the \nmeeting said he was being \u201cseparated\u201d for the good of the company and him too, and \nApplicant agreed with that sentiment. Overall, it was a mutually beneficial and amicable \nseparation. Applicant was asked by Department Counsel why he had selected \u201cleft by \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance\u201d on the e-QIP and \nwrote \u201cIt is still unclear whether or not it was due to performance or misconduct,\u201d if he \nbelieved that he had not been terminated for cause. Applicant responded that he was \njust clarifying on the e-QIP that his departure from CA was neither for performance nor \nmisconduct. He was not provided an \u201camicable separation\u201d on the e-QIP\u2019s drop-down \nmenu. (Tr. 12; Tr. #2 35-37; GE 1) \nApplicant participated in a background interview on January 10, 2022, and he \nfalsified material facts when he told the investigator that he could not provide any \nadditional information regarding his departure from CA because he never received any \ncommunications as to why his employment at CA ended. Other evidence indicates, \nApplicant attended a meeting in January 2020 in which he was told the exact reasons \nwhy he was being terminated from CA. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) Applicant denied this allegation. (Tr. \n12) Applicant claimed that he was never provided any personal or work-related reasons \nfor his separation from CA, other than it was for the good of the company and him too. It \nwas a mutually beneficial and amicable separation. (Tr. 11; Tr. #2 37-38; GE 2) \nApplicant does not admit that he was fired by CA, however, he does admit they \nhad an amicable separation. When asked if Applicant ever characterized his departure \nfrom CA as \u201claid-off,\u201d his response was, \u201cNo. I would not.\u201d Department Counsel showed \nApplicant that he had crossed-out the term \u201cfired\u201d from his background interview report \nand replaced it with \u201claid-off.\u201d Applicant made corrections to the report[s] and then \ncertified that the report[s] were now accurate. When he had met with the investigator, \nthe expression \u201cterminated\u201d was listed multiple times during the background interview. \nHe denied using that word with the investigator and crossed out the majority of those \nwords in the report. Applicant testified that if he mischaracterized \u201ctermination\u201d as \u201claid-\noff,\u201d it was a mistake on his part, but he was only trying to show that there was not a \nnegative connotation associated with the conclusion of his CA employment. Department \nCounsel pointed out that Applicant had characterized his CA employment as \n\u201cterminated\u201d in his February 2020 response to another GA\u2019s employment suitability \nletter in which he wrote, \u201cOn January 29, 2020, I was terminated from my job at [CA].\u201d \nApplicant response was that there was a confidentiality agreement between him and CA \nconcerning his termination, and he can only say that it was resolved amicably. (Tr. #2 \n63-67) \nDepartment Counsel: And it\u2019s still your stance, [Applicant], that you \nwere not terminated for cause; is that right? \nApplicant: Correct. (Tr. #2 68) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant also falsified material facts during a December \n2022 background interview when he reported to the investigator that he had no \ndisciplinary actions or misconduct during his employment with CA. In truth, however, he \nwas counseled on various occasions for his misconduct, including his inability to follow \ninstructions, engaging in unapproved telework, and falsifying time and attendance \nrecords.

He was never told by anyone that he was falsifying time and \nattendance records or counseled for failing to follow instructions.

Applicant \ndenied this allegation. (Tr. 12) \nAfter Applicant was issued a GA laptop, J stated that he was required to \nparticipate in training. There is specific training he would have taken that the deletion of \nfiles owned by the government is strictly prohibited and considered a federal crime. \nAfter Applicant resigned in lieu of termination in January 2020, J requested IT provide \nall of the files from Applicant\u2019s GA laptop to him. IT reported that there were no files and \n\u201cthe hard drive had been optimized.\u201d Any work or any files that had been on the \ngovernment laptop were no longer obtainable. J testified that Applicant had sent him \ndocuments in the past, so, at the very least, those documents should have been on the \ngovernment laptop. (Tr. 50-52, 77, 167-168) \nApplicant testified that he was not aware he was leaving CA until he attended the \nJanuary 2020 meeting. He had his GA laptop with him at the meeting. He admitted that \nafter the meeting, he accessed his GA laptop to report the contractual time he spent \nsupporting contracts. He stated that he was within \u201ceyeshot\u201d of one the participants at \nthe meeting. He denied that he deleted anything from his GA laptop. (Tr. #2 39-41, 45) \nSOR allegation \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant, upon his departure from CA, \nengaged in unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of data in an \ninformation technology system when he deleted data from his CA laptop. Applicant \ndenied this allegation. (Tr. 12) He testified that he did access the CA laptop at home \nfollowing the January 2020 meeting. He had some personal files that he wanted to \naccess before turning in the laptop. He said the meeting participants were aware he had \npersonal files on the CA laptop, and they did not object to him looking for those files. He \nsaid that shortly after he received his GA laptop, all of the files that he ever stored on his \nCA laptop were moved, not copied, to the GA\u2019s OneDrive, so he could access it on his \nGA laptop. He primarily used his GA laptop and did not use the CA laptop. After the \nJanuary 2020 meeting, he received a notification that his access was removed. He \nreported all of the files, to include personal files, were not on his employer\u2019s laptop. (Tr. \n# 2 41-45) \nJust before the January 2020 meeting, P had locked Applicant\u2019s computer cloud \naccount. Immediately following the meeting Applicant went home to get his CA laptop, \nand he returned it to her later with everything completely deleted from that laptop. \n\u201cThere were no folders. There were no files, no icons, nothing.\u201d She found that he had \nlogged into the CA laptop an hour earlier that same day and \u201cwiped his computer clean.\u201d \nShe did an inventory of his hard drive and found there were previous documents that \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere in the cloud from that morning that he could not access to delete, because she \nhad locked him out of the cloud earlier. (Tr. 121-131, 173-174; AE A) \nCharacter References \nD, a GA employee and the supervisor of J, testified at the hearing. He admitted \nthat Applicant and J were not getting along well. Applicant met with D to complain about \nJ, and also asked him if there was anything that could be done. D allowed Applicant to \nwork directly for him so that he would not have to interact with J. D found Applicant to \nhave a good work ethic, and his assignments were of good quality and prompt. D said \nthat J is a good employee, but he is better out in the field than in the office. He believed \nJ and Applicant had a difference of opinion about how work should be performed, so he \nthought it best to separate them. He would hire Applicant if the opportunity ever \npresented itself. (Tr. 195-201) \nA government contractor employee testified that she worked with Applicant in \napproximately 2019 mainly via telephone contact. They were both working for D as \nsupport personnel for the GA. She had been assigned a difficult task and asked \nApplicant for assistance. He came up with a brilliant plan, and they were able to connect \nwith 98 percent of their assigned contacts when they originally only had email \naddresses for about 20 percent. She credits Applicant for the success of that \nassignment. She never found him to be condescending or rude. She testified that she \nwas not called upon to reconstruct missing data on Applicant\u2019s GA laptop, but she also \nadmitted that she is infrequently called upon to do those types of tasks. (Tr. 185-192) \nApplicant\u2019s sister testified for Applicant. She visited Applicant at work. He was \nhappy, professional, and invited her to lunch with him and a colleague. P stated that she \nwitnessed Applicant being demeaning to his sister by introducing her around the office \nas his \u201cfat sister.\u201d P said that another CA employee pulled Applicant to the side to tell \nhim to stop introducing her that way. Applicant\u2019s sister testified that at no point was her \nbrother demeaning or condescending to her when he took her around the office. She \nhas never witnessed Applicant be demeaning to anyone. She finds him to be caring and \nkind. They have a wonderful relationship. (Tr. 175-176, 204-207) \nApplicant testified that he is involved in community service. He is a fraternity \nadvisor, and an advisor for his alumni board of trustees. He is also a local high school \nadvisor for a youth group. He estimated that he volunteers between 10 to 15 hours a \nweek between the three positions. He also receives high praise for his work \ncontributions from his current government contractor. He has been recognized for \noutstanding efforts, earned several bonuses and has been promoted more than once \nsince he started work there. He has matured since he was separated from CA in \nJanuary 2020. (Tr. #2 46-50) \nThe fourth witness to testify at the hearing was a manager at Applicant\u2019s current \nplace of employment.

(Tr. #2 8-16) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official,\u2026in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, \u2026; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwholeperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information, and;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified or covered-up material and relevant \ninformation concerning his job termination in 2016 and 2020, his misconduct in the \nworkplace, and his unauthorized deletion of files from the GA\u2019s laptop and his \nemployer\u2019s laptop. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable, however, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. Applicant\u2019s multiple incidents of failing \nto follow his employer\u2019s directions and rules, as well as engaging in deceitful conduct \nmakes AG \u00b6 16(d) applicable. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nThe established facts concerning the SOR allegations all demonstrate \nApplicant\u2019s questionable judgment, unreliability, lack of candor, and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. In 2016, he confronted a customer who did not leave \nhim a tip, which was a violation of the restaurant\u2019s company policy, and this \ninappropriate behavior resulted in his termination. His inappropriate behavior continued \nin the CA workplace, where he again showed poor judgment by intentionally ignoring his \nemployer\u2019s telework rules. I find his conduct was especially dishonorable after he was \nconfronted about his deception, then granted a travel stipend by his employer, but he \ncontinued to engage in unauthorized telework. That conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe same misconduct is alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, so I find in favor of \nApplicant concerning \u00b6 1.a and rule against Applicant on \u00b6 1.b. I also find that Applicant \nlied on the e-QIP and during interviews about the true circumstances of his resignation \nin lieu of termination from CA following a pattern of misconduct, of which he was fully \naware. He also lied on the e-QIP when he listed that P, his direct supervisor at CA, \nrarely had interaction (possibly two dozen conversations) with him while he was \nemployed at CA for 18 months. He lied when he denied he was removed from working \nwith the GA for work-related misconduct, he lied about receiving any counseling for \nviolating rules and instructions while employed, and he lied when he denied that he had \nremoved files without authorization from both CA and GA\u2019s laptops. He admitted, \nhowever, that he was debarred from government employment with a GA after being \nfound unsuitable based on misconduct and negligence in a prior employment (CA), and \nfalsifying background investigative documents. \nI found both of Applicant\u2019s supervisors were credible witnesses. They described \nseveral instances of Applicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct and insubordination. Applicant \ndenied that he had ever been counseled in the workplace, and he continues to cover-up \nthe fact that he was terminated for a pattern of misconduct. It is clear during that \nJanuary 2020 meeting that the company was terminating Applicant from employment. \nHe was given two options: 1) He would sign the severance package they offered him, or \n2) if he failed to sign the agreement, they would give him a memorandum and fire him \non the spot. Again, this is a resignation in lieu of termination. He acknowledged during \nthe meeting that he was not surprised what was taking place, and he covertly recorded \nthe meeting with his Apple watch to protect himself. Had he been honest from the \nbeginning about the circumstances surrounding his resignation in lieu of termination, \nthat conduct would likely have been mitigated. Applicant did not make good-faith efforts \nto correct his misrepresentations which continued through the hearing. AG \u00b6 17(a) does \nnot apply. \nMany of Applicant\u2019s explanations are contradictory and not credible. His inability \nto accept responsibility for his behavior continues and shows a lack a rehabilitation. \nInsufficient time has passed to determine if Applicant has changed his behavior. There \nis insufficient evidence to determine that the circumstances contributing to his \nuntrustworthy and unreliable behavior no longer exist, or that such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. Personal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern relating to the use of information technology is set out in \nAG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 40 is potentially applicable: \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant removed files, to include proprietary information \nfiles, from his GA laptop and his CA laptop, without authorization. AG \u00b6 40(f) applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel. \nThe above analysis under personal conduct also applies here. Applicant turned \nin the CA laptop completely wiped, but P, who had earlier locked Applicant from the \ncloud account, found documents in there that he could not access and delete. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(a) and 41(c) do not apply. \n  Whole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s current positive employment reviews, his recent \npromotion, and other favorable acknowledgments from character evidence. However, I \nalso considered that he lied, deceived, and failed to follow established rules on multiple \noccasions, and still refuses to accept responsibility for his actions. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe personal conduct and use of information technology security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 51-year-old truck driver operating as an independent contractor of a defense contractor that is sponsoring her for a security clearance. She has been driving for that contractor since about April 2020. She attended college for a period without earning a degree. She has been married for more than 12 years after her first marriage ended in divorce. She has three adult children and three adult stepchildren.

She has been \ndriving for that contractor since about April 2020. She attended college for a period \nwithout earning a degree. She has been married for more than 12 years after her first \nmarriage ended in divorce. She has three adult children and three adult stepchildren. \n(Tr. at 27-28; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, \nunfiled federal and state income tax returns, unpaid federal and state taxes, and \ndelinquent debts. \nApplicant was unemployed from about June 2017 to April 2018.

She felt that her only option was to file bankruptcy. (Tr. at 21; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 8) \nChapter 7 Bankruptcy \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in June 2017. She received financial \ncounseling as a requirement of the bankruptcy. The petition did not list any claims under \nSchedule D, Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property. Under Schedule E/F, \nCreditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the petition listed priority claims of $3,000 in \nfederal taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016, and $200 in state taxes for 2016. The \npetition listed 27 nonpriority claims, including $12,000 owed on the deficiency of an auto \nloan. Her dischargeable debts were discharged in October 2017. (Tr. at 63-64; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7) \n2015 Federal Taxes \nApplicant had tax problems before and after the bankruptcy. She filed her 2015 \nfederal income tax return on time, but she did not pay all the taxes due. She established \nan installment agreement in June 2016 and made multiple payments until October 2017 \nwhen the installment agreement ended, possibly because of the bankruptcy. She \nestablished another installment agreement in November 2017 and made multiple \npayments until the installment agreement ended in July 2019. From October 2016 to \nApril 2019, there were nine $25 penalties for dishonored payments. In March 2019, \nwhat would have been a refund of $1,147 from her 2018 taxes was withheld and \ntransferred to her 2015 taxes. She established another installment agreement in July \n2023. She made $154 and $240 payments in August 2023. As of February 2024, she \nowed $799 in taxes and interest. She paid $500 in March 2024 and $305 in April 2024 \ntoward her 2015 federal taxes. Her 2015 federal income taxes are paid. (Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 6, 8; AE A, D) \n2016 Federal Taxes \nApplicant filed her 2016 federal income tax return on time, but she did not pay all \nthe taxes due. The installment agreements discussed above for 2015 also covered what \nshe owed for 2016. Nothing was paid for 2016 because taxes owed for the oldest years \nare generally paid first, except a $300 payment in October 2023 was credited to her \n2016 taxes. As of February 2024, she owed $1,181 in taxes and interest. She paid $300 \nin April 2024 and $500 in June 2024 toward her 2016 federal taxes. She made a $400 \npayment on an unknown date. Her 2016 federal income taxes are likely paid. \n(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6; AE A, D) \n2017 Federal Taxes \nApplicant did not file her 2017 federal income tax return until May 2023.

The IRS reported that the 2017 return was received in May \n2023. What would have been a refund of $1,180 was transferred to taxes owed for a \nprevious year. (Tr. at 23, 35-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6, 8; AE A, D) \n2018 Federal Taxes \nApplicant filed her 2018 federal income tax return on time. What would have \nbeen a refund of $1,147 was transferred to taxes owed for tax year 2015. (GE 6) \n2019 Federal Taxes \nApplicant did not file her 2019 federal income tax return when it was due. The \nIRS received the signed return in February 2023. She stated that her husband\u2019s medical \nproblems in 2019 contributed to her not filing her 2018 tax returns on time. However, as \nstated above, her 2018 return was filed on time. The 2019 return should have been filed \nin 2020, a year after his medical condition. (Tr. at 23, 37-38; GE 6; AE A, D) \nApplicant did not pay all the federal incomes taxes for 2019 when they were due. \nAs of August 2023, she owed the IRS $601. She paid $500 in February 2024 toward her \n2019 federal taxes. It is likely that her 2019 taxes were paid or otherwise resolved \nbecause taxes for 2019 are not part of a later installment agreement. (GE 6; AE A, D) \n2020 Federal Taxes \nApplicant filed her 2020 federal income tax return on time. She received tax \ncredits and was issued a $499 payment in March 2021. (GE 6) \n2021 Federal Taxes \nApplicant filed her 2021 federal income tax return on time, but she did not pay all \nthe taxes due. She received a tax credit and was issued a $2,800 payment in April \n2021. As of December 2022, she owed $7,171 in taxes, penalties, and interest. As of \nAugust 2023, she owed $7,606. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6; AE D) \nApplicant\u2019s July 2023 installment agreement with the IRS required her to pay \n$239 per month. As of August 2023, she owed $9,965 for tax years 2015, 2016, and \n2021. As indicated above, 2015 and 2016 federal taxes are likely paid. She missed a \npayment in December 2023.

(Tr. at 24, 54-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, C, F, M) \nDelinquent Debts \nIn addition to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy and tax matters discussed above, the \namended SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $7,650. The debts are \nestablished through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. (Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2-6) The status of individual debts is as follows. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges $4,218 owed to a public utility company. Applicant denied \nowing the amount alleged because she had outages and higher-than-normal bills. She \nfiled a complaint with the state\u2019s public utility commission. She stated that there was an \ninvestigation and a lawsuit that took two years to resolve. She did not receive a bill \nduring that period, and when she finally did, it was more than $4,000. She initially stated \nthat she was willing to pay a little more than half that amount, but if she was required to \nset up a payment plan, she would. (Tr. at 56-57; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-6, \n8; AE A) \nApplicant decided to pay the public utility company. She initiated a $175 per \nmonth payment plan in about July 2023. She increased her payments to $283 per week \nby automatic debit. As of May 2024, she had paid $3,478 and reduced the balance to \n$738. (Tr. at 57; GE 2-6; AE J) \nThe SOR alleges medical debts of $1,857 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), $553 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and \n$325 (SOR \u00b6 1.l) collected by the same collection company. Applicant set up a $163 per \nmonth payment plan in July 2023, which increased to $200 per month. Applicant\u2019s \n1 The SOR did not allege that Applicant owed taxes for 2023.

She \nadmitted that applying for a security clearance was a factor in her decision to resolve \nher financial issues. She does not have medical insurance because it is too expensive. \nShe does not think it makes sense to pay premiums and still have $10,000 deductible. \nShe indicated that she had additional medical debts of about $15,000.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, \nunfiled federal and state income tax returns, unpaid federal and state taxes, and \ndelinquent debts. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s son was in an auto accident and totaled her vehicle in about 2014. \nShe was unaware that her insurance carrier cancelled her insurance for late payment. \nHer mother-in-law passed away, and she and her husband had medical issues without \nmedical insurance. The COVID-19 pandemic and shutdown hindered their ability to get \nloads for their truck. Her son\u2019s accident, her mother-in-law\u2019s death, their medical \nproblems, and the COVID-19 pandemic were beyond her control. Failure to maintain \nauto and medical insurance were not beyond her control. I also do not find her tax \nissues to be beyond her control. Additionally, to obtain the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), she \nmust prove that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant paid or is paying all the non-tax debts. I find the Chapter 7 bankruptcy \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and the non-tax debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.l) are mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed tax returns and the paid taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b\u00ad\n1.d, 1.f, and 1.g). She still owes more than $7,000 to the IRS for 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). AG \n\u00b6 20(g) has some applicability to her 2021 taxes because that tax year is in her \ninstallment plan with the IRS. However, that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nThis is a difficult case because Applicant is an honest, hard-working woman who \nis trying. However, she is addressing her finances the wrong way. She paid or is paying \nthe medical debts alleged in the SOR, but her decision to go without medical insurance \nhas led to an additional $15,000 in medical debts. Her July 2023 installment agreement \nwith the IRS required her to pay $239 per month. As of August 2023, she owed $9,965 \nfor tax years 2015, 2016, and 2021, with $7,606 owed for 2021. I am crediting her with \nresolving the taxes before 2021, but she now owes an additional $3,800 for tax year \n2023. \nApplicant is essentially taking one step forward (paying past-due taxes and \ndelinquent debts) and one step back (not paying the current year\u2019s taxes and accruing \nnew delinquent debts). She owes more now than when the SOR was issued. It does \nlittle good to pay past-due taxes while at the same time not paying the current year\u2019s \ntaxes. This may be harsh, and I understand that medical insurance is expensive, but it \nappears that Applicant\u2019s finances will never be stable until she obtains medical \ninsurance and pays her current year\u2019s taxes when they are due. Additionally, a \nclearance holder without medical insurance would be vulnerable if a medical procedure \nbecomes necessary. I know this is difficult for Applicant because she believes that she \ncannot afford to pay medical insurance and her current taxes, but until she can work out \nhow to do that, she will not be financially stable. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Her financial issues are recent and ongoing, and \ncontinue to raise doubts about her judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules \nand regulations. None of the above mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate \nfinancial considerations security concerns raised by her unpaid 2021 federal taxes. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. However, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d I am obligated to follow that directive. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nWithdrawn \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Miller, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/09/2024 \nDecision \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \nIn August 2020, Applicant entered into a contract for solar equipment to be \ninstalled at his house. The project was financed through a loan from a finance company. \nThe solar equipment was installed, but not to Applicant\u2019s satisfaction. He has disputed \nresponsibility for making payment on the loan ever since. He also retained a third party \nto complete operation of the solar equipment, which is now licensed and operating. There \nis no indication that he has informed the solar equipment company, the financing \ncompany, or the bank that now owns the loan, that the equipment is now operational. He \nhas taken no action to initiate payment for the solar panel system. The loan remains \ncharged off, though it was removed from his credit reports shortly before the hearing. \nApplicant is benefitting from installation of solar panel equipment for which he has no \nintention to pay. While he believes his disputes with the solar equipment company are \nvalid, he nonetheless has a working solar panel system in his home, financed by a past-\ndue loan for which he has paid nothing. He is essentially benefiting from unjust \nenrichment. He has not acted responsibly or in good faith and the debt remains ongoing \nand unresolved. Despite the isolated nature of the debt, security concerns alleged and \nestablished under Guideline F (financial considerations) are not mitigated.

On \nMay 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The CAS issued \nthe SOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 31, 2023, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case \nwas assigned to me on March 5, 2024. The case was initially set for a hearing by video \nteleconference on April 22, 2024, by mutual agreement. On that day, when the parties \nappeared on camera, it was apparent that Applicant was appearing from a hospital room, \nand he reported that he had been admitted overnight following a visit to the ER. By mutual \nagreement, the hearing did not convene, and was rescheduled to May 23, 2024, also by \nvideo-teleconference. A hearing notice was subsequently issued, on April 29, 2024. (Tr. \n14-15) \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough BBB. All the exhibits were admitted without objection. The day after the hearing, \nhe submitted three credit reports by email, all from May 24, 2024, for admission into the \nrecord. The email (AE CCC) and the credit reports (AE DDD, EEE, and FFF) were all \nadmitted without objection. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) V) DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on June 6, 2024. \nThe record initially closed on May 24, 2024. However, while preparing the decision, \nI reopened the record on August 2, 2024, to inquire whether Applicant had responded to \na letter he had received from the creditor, Bank K, a week before the hearing. (HE VI) On \nAugust 7, 2024, Applicant submitted a timely response with a lengthy narrative, submitted \nby e-mail, with four attachments. His response is marked as AE GGG and admitted \nwithout objection. (HE VII) The record closed on August 7, 2024. \nPre-Hearing Jurisdictional Matter \nWhen he was first contacted about scheduling his hearing, Applicant asserted that \nthe subject matter of the hearing (the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a) had been reviewed and \nadjudicated by another government agency, which had granted him \u201ca reduced level of \nclearance.\u201d This was interpreted as eligibility for a position of public trust. At my request, \nDepartment Counsel researched the matter, and noted that Applicant was now seeking \neligibility for a secret security clearance granted by DOD, and reciprocity did not apply, \nunder Section E.1.c of SEAD 7. (HE I, HE II) Department Counsel is correct. I explained \nmy ruling at the beginning of the hearing.

All of them were \nadmitted, as noted above. During the hearing, it became apparent that I did not have \navailable copies of several of his proffered exhibits, though Department Counsel did. I \ntherefore asked Department Counsel to mark and identify those documents (AE Q \nthrough AE WW) for the record. He did so, using the descriptions provided by Applicant \nin his exhibit list (AE Q). (Tr. 49-60) In some cases, Applicant\u2019s descriptions of some of \nhis documents contained his own conclusions of what the documents showed. I have \ndescribed the documents in the Findings of Fact section, below. \nAE B is a 64-page document, comprised mostly of e-mails and other documents \nbetween Applicant and various commercial, financial, and governmental entities involved \nin his solar equipment project. They are largely dated between October 2020 and August \n2021. Most, but not all, of these documents were also provided as separate exhibits here. \nWhere AE B is cited in the facts section, below, I have used page numbers to aid in the \ndocuments\u2019 identification. \nLastly, the exhibit list in the transcript (Tr. 3-4) is incomplete, as several exhibits \nadmitted during the hearing (GE 5, AE K, AE DD, and AE XX-ZZ) are erroneously not \nlisted. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, the sole debt in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 51 years old. He is married and has two adult children and one minor \nchild. He has worked for a large consulting company since November 2021. He has a \nhigh school diploma, some college courses, numerous certifications, and over 25 years \nof experience in government contracting. He has an annual salary of over $120,000. (GE \n1; AE K, AE L; Tr. 70-71, 187-189, 232-236) \nApplicant has held clearances in the past and provided a non-disclosure \nagreement from October 2022. (Tr. 12-13; AE VV) He also believes he has, or has had, \neligibility for access to sensitive, but unclassified, information, through contracting work \nwith other government agencies outside of DOD. This was not verified by Department \nCounsel, though Applicant has a Common Access Card (CAC). (Tr. 142-148; see also \njurisdiction discussion, above) Applicant takes pride in his work and profession and how \nhe manages his life. The loss of his clearance would be a detriment to his career. (Tr. 70\u00ad\n71, 159, 232-236) He is very well regarded at work (AE J) \nThis case involves a single past-due debt, of $34,264, owed to Bank K. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), a loan Applicant incurred to finance installation of solar power equipment at his \nhome. The debt is listed on a September 2022 credit bureau report (CBR) as being in \ncollection to a solar equipment loan company. (GE 3 at 2). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose the debt as delinquent or past due on his August 2022 \nSCA and did not raise the debt in his background interview, a month later, until he was \nconfronted about it. He then briefly explained the origins of the loan and the solar \ncompany and said that the debt was settled and closed. (GE 1 at 36-38; GE 2 at 3; Tr. \n190-191). In his January 2023 interrogatory response, Applicant reported that the debt \nwas paid, while also providing numerous documents about the solar equipment project. \n(GE 5 at 2, 10; Tr. 191-193) \nThe debt is also listed as past due to Bank K on a May 2023 CBR (GE 4 at 8) and \nas charged off by Bank K on April 2024 CBRs provided by both parties. (GE 6 at 8; AE G \nat 16-17, AE H at 58; Tr. 141, 189) \nAt the outset, it is worth noting that there is no dispute about Applicant\u2019s ability to \npay the debt. He earns a six-figure salary and has ample assets and income, as indicated \nby recent personal financial statements, pay stubs and the above credit reports, which \nshow no other delinquencies of note. (GE 5 at 7; AE M, AE N; Tr. 212) \nChronological Timeline \nApplicant and wife own their home in State 1. In August 2020, he was contacted \nby a sales representative for solar panel equipment company MS. He was interested in \nhaving solar panel equipment installed on his house. He testified that his parents had a \nsolar-powered home, and that he had some knowledge and expertise in the field. He also \ntestified that he bought the property and built his home there, with intentions of having it \nrun on solar power. (Tr. 74-78, 95-96) \nOn or about August 11, 2020, the MS sales representative came to Applicant\u2019s \nhome. Applicant testified that the sales pitch included a discussion of the solar \nequipment\u2019s power consumption, monthly cost, overall price, and other aspects of the \nproposed contract. Applicant agreed to sign the contract after discussing it with his wife. \n(AE W; Tr. 74, 78-79, 193) \nApplicant testified repeatedly that he did not sign a contract. He said he attempted \nto sign on the sales rep\u2019s tablet computer screen but was not certain that he completed a \nsignature. (AE W; Tr. 77-79, 84-85, 119-120, 136, 193) He also acknowledged that he \nmade assumptions about how other signatures on the contract got there: \u201cThese were all \nassumptions I had made.\u201d (Tr. 84) However, in his interrogatory response, he said a \n\u201ccontract was entered for purchase and installation of a solar [equipment] system.\u201d (GE 5 \nat 10; Tr. 193) \nApplicant also said he wanted installation of solar equipment at a higher kilowatt \n(KW), \u201cTier 2,\u201d level. This would generate more power than needed for the home\u2019s use. \nHe was of the understanding that the amount of the contract was about $46,000 for the \nrequisite solar power equipment for the increase in power generation. He also said he \nwas not given a copy of the contract at the time.

It is electronically signed by MS\u2019s chief financial officer (CFO) \nand initialed by Applicant, on August 11, 2020. (AE X, of which AE Y is a duplicate) The \ntotal amount to be paid to MS is listed as $33,524, through a third-party lender, finance \ncompany D. (AE X at 1) Applicant acknowledged that he viewed a copy of the contract \nelectronically. (AE Z) \nApplicant had three days to cancel the contract, after he signed it on August 11, \n2020. The cancellation page is unsigned. (AE X at 8) Subsequent cancellation by the \ncustomer, or if the customer otherwise prevented MS from completing the installation, \nwould lead to reimbursement to MS \u201cin full for the cost of materials, labor, and services \nprovided up to the date and time of cancellation.\u201d (AE X at 3) \nApplicant would also be in breach of the contract if he failed \u201cto make any \nscheduled payments on time, in full, and otherwise in accordance with this agreement.\u201d \nAE X at 3) If he failed to pay the \u201cthird-party finance company pursuant to the terms of \n[Applicant\u2019s] agreement with them, [he] may be subject to any of the terms and remedies \nset forth in that agreement.\u201d (AE X at 3) The agreement with finance company D is not in \nthe record. \nA few days later, on or about August 14, 2020, a workman from MS came to inspect \nApplicant\u2019s home and take photos. Applicant was told to empty his attic. (AE W; Tr. 77\u00ad\n79, 193-194) \nAE II is a permit application to City S regarding the solar panel installation project. \nIt is signed electronically on August 18, 2020, by both Applicant and an MS \nrepresentative. Both signatures are notarized. (AE II) There is also a \u201cNotice of \nCommencement\u201d signed by Applicant the same day, August 18, 2020. (AE S) \nAE GG is an application to the \u201carchitectural review committee\u201d of Applicant\u2019s \nhomeowners association (HOA). It concerns the solar panel installation by MS. It is signed \nelectronically by Applicant, and dated August 24, 2020. (AE W at 6, AE GG, AE QQ) \nApplicant asserts that the application to the HOA is fraudulent, because he was the HOA \npresident, and never signed it. (AE Q). There is no indication on AE GG that the HOA \napproved the application. (AE GG) \nIn late September 2020, MS workers called to schedule the installation of the solar \nequipment. Their initial appointment was postponed because they called the night before \nApplicant and his family were going out of town, but the appointment was rescheduled for \nsoon thereafter. The workers appeared on the morning of September 29, 2020 (the day \nafter Applicant returned) to install the equipment. Applicant acknowledged that he let them \nin his house, and knew they were there to install the solar and electrical equipment and \ndid so. He also said they completed about 80% of the work. On October 2, 2020, they \nreturned and \u201cexplained that everything was completed and all that was left was \ninspections and to activate\u201d the equipment.

(AE SS) \nThe same day, MS completed the service upgrade, though he also said an MS electrician \ncame and \u201cdowngraded\u201d the solar panel system \u201cto meet what they had installed.\u201d This \nled Applicant to contact an MS customer representative. (Tr. 80-83) \nOn or about October 19, 2020, Applicant asked City S officials whether there were \nany ordinances restricting the number of panels to be installed. He was told there were \nnone, and that it was up to the contractor and engineer to verify State 1 building code \ncompliance. (AE TT; Tr. 85-86) The same day, he emailed MS, asserting that MS had \nmade \u201cfalse and untrue\u201d misrepresentations about what MS was able to do under local \nordinances. He asserted that various electronically signed documents showed \u201cfraud\u201d by \nMS, \u201cas I never agreed to a lesser system for any reason. . . . At this time, this matter is \nindefinitely on hold.\u201d (AE TT; Tr. 90-92) \nApplicant essentially asserts that he agreed, or intended to agree, to a contract for \ninstallation of a solar panel system of higher kilowatt (Tier 2) capacity, for about $46,000, \nand not the contract for about $33,500 at issue here. He also asserted that the solar panel \nequipment was not saving him enough money and was producing less power than \nexpected, as it was not a \u201cTier 2\u201d system. In essence, this was the beginning of his dispute \nwith MS, since he believes MS installed the lower-level system (at the lower price) without \nhis permission. He acknowledged that City S had approved both plans. (AE AA, AE CC, \nAE DD; Tr. 84-90) He said that he was the victim of a \u201cbait and switch\u201d by MS (albeit one \ninvolving less money, for a lesser system, than he thought he had agreed to, not more). \n(Tr. 92) \nHowever, the record does not contain a signed contract for a more expensive solar \npanel system (of about $46,000), and Applicant said he did not have one and never \nreceived one from MS. (Tr. 137-138) He also denied signing a contract for the $33,500 \nsolar equipment, notwithstanding his initial on the installation contract and a letter from \nBank K. (AE B at 57, AE X at 7; Tr. 138) \nApplicant asserted that MS was being investigated criminally for their conduct. (Tr. \n92-93; AE C). He also said he filed complaints with State 1 regulators and the Better \nBusiness Bureau (BBB) in about October 2020. (AE W; Tr. 94, 97-98, 206-208) By this \ntime, he said, MS was non-responsive to his concerns. (Tr. 98-100) \nOn November 9, 2020, Applicant received a request from finance company D to \nelectronically sign a \u201cCustomer Installation Agreement.\u201d (AE B at 17; Tr. 100-101) The \nsame day, he emailed MS regarding his dispute about various aspects of the equipment\u2019s \ninstallation, production, and other specifications. MS responded with answers to his \nquestions. He was dissatisfied and requested more updates later in the month. (AE QQ, \nAE RR) \nOn December 20, 2020, Applicant emailed MS to say, \u201cThanks for all the hard \nwork, couple things [I] need confirmation on to wrap this up.\u201d (AE EE) MS wrote back to \nsay: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTo confirm, we are covering the cost for the meter and inspection as per \nusual course of business.

If the (3) panels do \nnot meet the documented production we will add more at our cost, as \ndiscussed. (AE EE; Tr. 106-107) \nApplicant forwarded this email exchange to finance company D on February 22, 2021. \n(AE EE) \nOn January 6, 2021, finance company D sent Applicant a \u201cNotice of Completion,\u201d \nand wrote him that \u201cWe have been informed by your Contractor that the system \n(\u2018Improvements\u2019) described below have been installed. . . . [Accordingly], we disbursed \npayment to your contractor. Please be aware that your payment obligations under your \nloan will begin.\u201d Applicant was directed to contact finance company D with any questions, \nand \u201cif your improvements have not been installed or if the work has not been completed\u201d \nin accordance with the contract. (AE HH, AE OO; Tr. 103-106) \nOn January 12, 2021, Applicant emailed MS and requested a copy of the \n\u201cpurchase agreement.\u201d (AE KK) On January 24, 2021, he emailed finance company D \nregarding ongoing issues with MS. He said, \u201cThe remaining solar panels were installed \nas of Jan 12, 2021. At this time, the solar panels were physically \u2018powered up\u2019 but there \nseemed to be an issue of whether the power was \u2018flowing back to the grid.\u2019\u201d He noted that \nhe had contacted MS numerous times in recent days regarding final inspection, and \ninstallation of the solar meter by the local power company (LPC). He said the solar \nequipment was causing an increased power bill. (AE B at 21-23, AE LL, AE CC; Tr. 101-\n112, 213) Applicant requested that billing be placed on hold until the LPC confirmed that \nthe system was complete. He said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure if something is not completed, if you\u2019re \nleaving out the primary components that make it go, it\u2019s like getting a cart with no wheels.\u201d \n(Tr. 109) On January 27, 2021, finance company D wrote back to say they would contact \nMS \u201cto address outstanding issues.\u201d (AE LL; see also AE EE, discussed above)  \nAt his hearing, Applicant acknowledged, however, that MS installed additional \npanels on about January 12, 2021, as agreed, and that, \u201cif that doesn\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll add \nmore.\u201d (Tr. 107-108) At this point, Applicant asserted, his power bill significantly \nincreased. (Tr. 108-109; AE CC) He believed it was MS\u2019s responsibility to complete the \ninspection and to contact the LPC to finalize matters so excess solar power could be \nabsorbed by the LPC. (Tr. 111-112) \nOn February 2, 2021, having not heard a response from finance company D, \nApplicant asserted that there had been a breach of contract, consistent \nmisrepresentations, and failure to properly activate the service. On that basis, he stated \nhe intended to file a lawsuit. (AE B at 26; Tr. 110-113) He renewed this statement on \nFebruary 20, 2021. (AE B at 30) This resulted in a call with a finance company D \nrepresentative two days later. (AE B at 31-36; Tr. 114-116) It is unclear when Applicant \nfirst received a bill for his first payment.

Having not heard anything further, Applicant said. \u201cMy \nformal demand for forfeiture of the system remains intact.\u201d He also demanded a response \nin writing. (AE B at 46) Applicant asserted that Mr. F told him that Bank K had paid MS in \nerror, but Applicant did not corroborate this assertion in writing. (Tr. 126-131) \nIn late February 2021, Applicant had filed a complaint with the Better Business \nBureau. (AE B at 37 and possibly AE W) MS responded on April 2, 2021, as follows, in \npertinent part (AE T): \n[Applicant\u2019s] assertions of wrongful conduct are incorrect. We have tried to \ncorrect [his] confusion in this matter. [MS] designed [Applicant\u2019s] system to \nachieve a certain level of production for which he signed off on. It is clear \nduring the consultation there was much back and forth on the desired \nsystem and the production from the system. It turned out he was confusing \nthe size of the system with the production from one of the quotes he \nreceived during the consultation. He was, in fact, already receiving \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsubstantially more energy than he was concerned with. Even with this \nexplanation, [Applicant] still insisted he was correct and did not allow us to \ncomplete the job. \nIn order to ensure the customer was satisfied, even though his assertions \nwere misguided, [MS] went so far as adding multiple panels free of charge. \n[Applicant] accepted this gesture . . . [and obtained] the necessary \ninsurance for the additional panels. [After MS added the panels, MS] has \ntried to attain the final steps necessary in order to energize [Applicant\u2019s] \nsystem, but [he] has refused to let [MS] on his property except when he has \nreceived panels free of charge. If [Applicant] would simply allow us to \ncomplete the last stages of the project and have the appropriate inspections \ndone to achieve completion as required by his local utility, he would be able \nto see the level of production that the system can generate and the savings \nhe can realize. \n[MS] has not falsified documents in this matter and has not abandoned his \nconstruction project as [Applicant] has stated. To the contrary, [MS] has \nfollowed the normal course of construction and will seek the final approvals \nat the appropriate time in order to energize the system. . . . [MS] remains \nprepared to complete the final work in order to energize the system. (AE T) \nThe Better Business Bureau noted that the matter was closed in its files and would be \ndocumented as \u201cAnswered \u2013 the business addressed the issues within the complaint, but \nthe consumer remains dissatisfied.\u201d (AE T) Applicant flatly asserted that MS\u2019s position \nwas false. (Tr. 201-203) \nOn April 6, 2021, Applicant had another conversation with Mr. F. He emailed \nfinance company D memorializing his version of the conversation and requested that Mr. \nF\u2019s statements be put in writing. (AE R) He testified that Mr. F told him Bank K would \nrepossess the equipment. This, Applicant said, would leave his home looking like \u201cSwiss \ncheese.\u201d He therefore asked City S to revoke the construction permit the same day, due \nto what he called MS\u2019s \u201cfailure to perform and fulfill its contractual obligation(s).\u201d (AE D, \nduplicated at AE U) The permit was revoked by City S on May 7, 2021. (AE NN, AE UU; \nGE 5 at 11; Tr. 198-199) \nOn April 7, 2021, Applicant wrote finance company D and Bank K (while also \nreferencing Mr. F), offering \u201cyour companies one final opportunity to reconsider and \namend the positions described yesterday in our conversation.\u201d (AE B at 48) \nOn May 17, 2021, Applicant responded to a letter he had received from Bank K, \nentitled \u201cConcerning your Solar Loan and Security Agreement.\u201d He asserted that MS had \nabandoned the project, the contracted work was not completed, and the solar equipment \nremained \u201cnot active.\u201d He provided a copy of the revoked permit from City S. Applicant \nasserted that he had no financial responsibility for any funds Bank K had released to MS, \nbased on MS\u2019s failure to complete the work.

As a result, Bank K exercised its right to \nrequest full payment of the loan amount due, then $34,395 in principal, interest, and fees. \n(AE B at 57; Tr. 135-139) \nIn August 2021, Applicant engaged with another entity, N, about this matter. What \npart N played is unclear, but he wrote them a long e-mail detailing his complaints and \ndemands related to all parties. (AE B at 59-60, AE F; Tr. 122-123) He testified that he \nengaged the builder of his home to assess the cost of removing all of the solar panels \nand equipment and what condition the home would be in as a result. He said again that \nthis would leave his roof like \u201cSwiss cheese,\u201d with repair costs of about $60,000 to \n$70,000. (Tr. 123-124) He demanded that they fix the problems with the home and the \nsolar panels. He construed their nonresponse as abandonment of the project under State \n1 law. He regarded their equipment to have been \u201cjunk,\u201d or at least, non-operational solar \nequipment that they had abandoned on his property. (Tr. 125-126, 209-210) \nOn June 3, 2022, Applicant filed a \u201cNotice of Commencement\u201d in State 1 county \ncourt regarding installation of additional solar panels at his home. He listed the contractor \nas \u201cSelf.\u201d (AE PP) \nIn October 2022, Applicant paid a third party for licensing, permits, and an electrical \ninspection, though he testified that he did some of the finishing work himself. He paid \nabout $1,000 out of pocket. (GE 5 at 12; Tr. 171-172, 185, 213) He asserted that he \u201ctook \na loss\u201d on the project because the fact that it was not operational or inspected meant he \ncould not \u201csell this house and build another one\u201d as he had planned. (Tr. 173-174) \nInspection was approved in early November 2022 (AE JJ; GE 5 at 28-31; Tr. 195-197) \nLater that month, the LPC granted Applicant \u201cPermission to Operate,\u201d and thus allowed \nhim to offset the energy he purchases from the LPC and to sell to the LPC any excess \nsolar power he generates but does not use. (GE 5 at 12; AE FF) \nThere is no indication in the record that Applicant reported to MS, finance company \nD, or Bank K that he had taken steps unilaterally to make the solar panel system at his \nhome licensed, operational, and connected to the LPC. (See discussion of AE YY, below). \nApplicant now has a working solar panel system in his home. It is fully licensed \nand approved by City S and other appropriate authorities. He considers that he owns the \nsystem: \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, I own it. They abandoned it.\u201d (Tr. 216) There are no \nliens in place and he has not been sued for payment on the contract. The solar panel \nsystem is operated by company E. (GE 5 at 28; Tr. 166-171, 184, 213-216, 225) \nApplicant has not paid any money to MS, finance company D, or Bank K and does \nnot intend to make any payments. He acknowledged that MS provided the labor and the \nequipment and that he let them into his home to do the work. (Tr. 170-173) He does not \nbelieve Bank K should have been involved, and \u201cif anything, they should pay me for me \nhaving to endure all these years that I put up with\u201d all the issues with the project.

(Tr. 22, 63-67) (AE O contains copies \nof Applicant\u2019s phone logs from this general timeframe as well). \nOn May 16, 2024, a week before the hearing, Applicant received a letter from Bank \nK: \u201cAction Requested regarding your [Bank K] Solar Loan ending in [XXXX].\u201d Bank K was \n\u201ctrying to determine the operating status of your solar equipment purchased with the \nabove-referenced solar loan.\u201d Based on the bank\u2019s \u201cunderstanding that your solar \nequipment may not yet be fully operational,\u201d Bank K offered to have the equipment \n\u201creviewed in an effort to make it operational.\u201d Bank K said it \u201cmay pay for reasonable costs \nassociated with attempting to make it operational, but to do so, we request your \ncooperation and assistance.\u201d Applicant was requested to contact Bank K \u201cno later than \nJune 15, 2024.\u201d (AE YY; see also AE XX and AE ZZ) \nApplicant\u2019s assertions \nIn discussing AE YY, Applicant asserted that Bank K had \u201cacknowledged in writing \nthat the system is not done.\u201d In fact, the bank had not acknowledged this, and was seeking \nto determine the solar equipment\u2019s operating status. (Tr. 164; AE YY) Applicant had not \ncontacted Bank K by the time of his hearing, a week later, though he said he intended to \ndo so. (Tr 164-166, 221-223) He said, \u201cI think it would -- the responsible thing to do, of \ncourse, is to follow up on that letter. . . . That\u2019s a sense of integrity for me.\u201d (Tr. 226-227) \nApplicant disputed that he signed a contract with MS and that he signed a loan \nagreement with either finance company D or Bank K. (Tr. 84-85, 119-120, 136-139) He \nasserted that his initial on the signature page of the contract was not valid, as, he said, it \nhad been inserted after the fact by MS. He questioned the validity of the signature \nbecause there is no timestamp. (AE A, AE X) He said he did not receive a copy of the \ncontract until October 2020. (Tr. 148-152) \nApplicant also questioned why Mr. F is noted as having received a copy of the \ncontract, on March 22, 2021. (AE A at 5; AE Z) As noted above, they began interacting in \nlate March 2021, a few days after this, and it is reasonable to infer that Mr. F wanted to \nsee a copy of the contract in question before he spoke to Applicant. Despite this, Applicant \nasserted that Mr. F had \u201cessentially known and been part of this since day one\u201d and was \ninvolved \u201cat the beginning\u201d with the \u201cfraud\u201d perpetrated upon him by MS, finance company \nD, and Bank K.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following AG is potentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \nThis case involves a single past-due debt, of $34,264, owed to Bank K. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), a loan Applicant incurred to finance installation of solar power equipment at his \nhome, in late 2020. The debt is listed on his September 2022 CBR as being in collection \nto a solar equipment loan company. The debt is also listed as past due to Bank K on a \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nMay 2023 CBR and as charged off by Bank K on April 2024 CBRs provided by both \nparties. \nThe Government has therefore established its prima facie case, notwithstanding \nApplicant\u2019s denials of responsibility for the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.a is established by the record \nevidence. including Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony, and by credit reports and very \nrecent correspondence from the creditor. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn August 2020, Applicant signed a valid contract for MS for the purchase and \ninstallation of solar equipment at his home, for about $33,500. When MS representatives \ncame to his home to install the equipment in late September 2020, he let them in to do \nthe work. The company installed the equipment with its own labor and services. Ever \nsince, Applicant has consistently disputed the specifications, the licensing, the permitting, \nand the suitability of the equipment for solar operations in his home. In 2022, he took \nunilateral steps to do what he believed was necessary to make the equipment operational, \nand he spent about $1,000 of his own money to do so. He asserts that he owns the solar \npanel equipment. He\u2019s probably right. But the problem is he hasn\u2019t paid for it. There is no \nevidence that MS has \u201cabandoned\u201d the equipment at his home, or that he owes them \nnothing. Quite the contrary. Indeed, the record reflects that several times in 2023, MS \nrepresentatives called him about the project. There is no indication that he responded. \nApplicant owes money to MS, or, more accurately, on the loan he signed agreeing to \nfinance the project \u2013 a loan now owned by Bank K, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nApplicant\u2019s loan obligation is ongoing and unresolved. The debt appears on \nmultiple credit reports from shortly before the hearing, and the creditor, Bank K, sent him \na letter for the purpose of \u201ctrying to determine the operating status of your solar equipment \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurchased with the above-referenced solar loan.\u201d As he confirmed in his post-hearing \nresponse (AE GGG), Applicant nonetheless did nothing to reengage with Bank K, despite \nhaving said that he would do so during his hearing testimony. The debt, while isolated, is \nalso ongoing and continues to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe fact that the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports \ndoes not preclude its consideration as a current security concern. It is also a continuing \ncourse of conduct, since it is not clearly established that it is resolved. The fact that the \ndebt is not reflected on credit reports from the day after the hearing does not indicate that \nthe debt has been resolved, no longer exists, or is no longer Applicant\u2019s responsibility. \nAbsence of a debt on a credit report \u201cis not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). \nFurther, while actual fraud, established by substantial evidence, could provide \nmitigation in appropriate circumstances, \u201cpossible fraud,\u201d is not a sufficient basis for \nfinding mitigation. ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012) In this case, \nApplicant\u2019s allegations that several of the documents are \u201cfraudulent\u201d or are evidence or \nproof of fraud are based on nothing more than his own speculation and vague, conclusory \nassertions. There is no evidence that the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.a is due to circumstances \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control, or, at this point, that his actions to address it are reasonable. \nApplicant has a right to assert a reasonable dispute as to whether MS completed \nits obligations under the contract. He might, arguably, have a claim for reduction of the \nmoney owed on the loan (now over $34,000) based on the estimated $1,000 in later \nexpenses he incurred to bring the equipment up to code, and to make it licensed and \noperational. But he does not have a right to pay nothing for working solar equipment in \nhis home. He has almost certainly breached the contract he signed with MS (AX at 3) and \nhe has not paid anything he owes on the financing loan now with Bank K. He has the \nequipment and he has the money. In essence, he is benefitting from unjust enrichment. \nHis irrational position suggests an indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal \nobligations. This, in turn, calls into question his willingness or capacity to comply with the \nsometimes complex rules governing the handling and safeguarding of classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 18-02914 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2020). AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) simply does not apply to the facts of this case. Believing that MS has \nabandoned its equipment at his home, and having made no payments whatsoever, \nApplicant has never undertaken anything close to a good-faith effort to pay on the loan \nhe undertook to finance the project. While his efforts to resolve the matter may have been \nreasonable at one point, that has not been the case for some time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s long career as a well-compensated and highly regarded \nemployee of defense and government contractors. I considered the circumstances of the \ndebt at issue here and the fact that it is isolated, as well as the fact that Applicant makes \na good salary and can afford to pay the debt. This cuts both ways, because he simply has \nchosen not to do so. He believes he is in the right, but his position at this point is untenable \nand unreasonable, since he has the equipment and owes on the loan. \nThere is also the matter of how Applicant treated the debt during the security \nclearance application process. He did not disclose the debt on his SCA. He did not \ndiscuss or reveal the debt during his background interview until he was confronted about \nit. And when that occurred, he said that the debt was settled and closed. In his January \n2023 interrogatory response, Applicant reported that the debt was paid. None of that was \ntrue, though he may have subjectively believed it to be the case. \nThere is no allegation of falsification or lack of candor under the Personal Conduct \nguideline, so I cannot consider this evidence as disqualifying conduct. But I can consider \nit in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person concept. Here, this evidence does \nnot help Applicant establish that he would do the right or the reasonable, responsible \nthing in protecting classified information. Applicant has not met his burden of establishing \nthat he has addressed the debt responsibly and that he is a suitable candidate for \neligibility for access to classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

In the \nbalance of his statement, Applicant described the positive impact that his security \nconsciousness and job performance has had over the last two years with his current \nemployer. (Response to FORM) Because Applicant requested an administrative \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to assess his \ncredibility or demeanor. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary positions addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot \nuse illegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to \nthe efficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for \nfederal employment. \nI have also taken administrative notice of the Director of National Intelligence \nMemorandum Adherence of Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, (October 25, \n2014), which clearly states that state laws do not authorize persons to violate federal \nlaw, including the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which \nidentifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard \nof the federal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. Agencies are required to \nemploy the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to commit clearly and convincingly to discontinue such \nmisuse.  \nApplicant began using marijuana in March 2022 after he obtained a medical \nmarijuana card in February 2022.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), \n25(f), and 25(g) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana regularly between March 2022 and at least early \nJune 2023. He purchased and used the drug while holding a security clearance or \nholding a sensitive position. He knew that illegal drug use was against federal law. He \nstated his intention to continue using the drug until his employer told him to stop. He \nacquired some level of reassurance for continued use because he did not think his \nemployer conducted drug tests. His marijuana use and intention to use the drug in the \nfuture raises continuing doubt regarding his judgment and reliability. AG \u00b6 26(a) does \nnot apply. \nThough Applicant admits his involvement with marijuana, he has furnished no \nindependent evidence of action taken to overcome his illegal drug use, with an objective \ndirected at abstinence from illegal marijuana use. Applicant has claimed that he stopped \nuse in early June 2023. While he may only ingest the drug by himself, he is still violating \nfederal law. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) does not apply. With no evidence of the surrounding facts \nand circumstances, I am unable to conclude one way or the other whether Applicant \nhas successfully changed his lifestyle and environment.

AG \n\u00b6 26(b)(3) is inapplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He has been working for his employer as a \ncybersecurity analyst since November 2021. He considers that he has contributed a \nmeaningful performance to his employer and the national security. \nAfter evaluating the entire record, the foregoing favorable evidence supporting \nsecurity eligibility is insufficient to overcome the evidence supporting a denial of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application. Applicant illegally used marijuana between \nMarch 2022 and at least June 2023. Applicant began using marijuana in March 2022, \nYet when he certified his security clearance application in early May 2022, he falsely \nclaimed that he had not used illegal drugs in the last 7 years, and that he had never \nused illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. Holding a security clearance is a \n24-hour-responsibilty which requires complying with all federal laws at work and after \nwork, even when the clearance is inactive, and regardless of the amount of classified \ninformation the holder may handle at any given time. A medical marijuana card confers \nno unique significance under the adjudicative guidelines or supplemental regulatory \npolicies. See ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022) Even though some \nstates have decriminalized marijuana use, it is still illegal at the federal level. Insufficient \ntime has passed to confidently conclude that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement is behind \nhim. After weighing the entire record under the whole person, Applicant\u2019s evidence in \nmitigation does not overcome the drug involvement guideline. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information or hold a sensitive position. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPaul J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 29 years old, married, and he does not have any children. (Answer; Items 1-2) Applicant was unemployed from July 2012 to March 2015. He worked in retail from March 2015 to March 2016. He then changed careers and worked as a machinist for various companies, to include a staffing company, until August 2021. He has since worked as a legal transcriptionist. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 2) The SOR alleges that Applicant had three medical debts in collection for $2,477, $1,265, and $51, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i), and six delinquent consumer accounts totaling $7,104 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h). The allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his August 2022 security clearance application (SCA), his February 2023 response to interrogatories, and credit bureau reports from September 2022 and March 2023. (Items 1-5) Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to minimal income, an employment layoff in January 2017, underemployment in March 2019, and an in-state relocation in August 2021. He planned to file bankruptcy or seek other debt relief programs to resolve his delinquent debts, but he did not provide documentation of his efforts. (Items 2-3) Applicant\u2019s three medical debts stem from an emergency visit that required him to have oral surgery. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f are for credit cards, in collection for $1,221, $814, $652, and $200, respectively. (Items 2-5) SOR ",

He is 29 years old, \nmarried, and he does not have any children. (Answer; Items 1-2) \nApplicant was unemployed from July 2012 to March 2015. He worked in retail \nfrom March 2015 to March 2016. He then changed careers and worked as a machinist \nfor various companies, to include a staffing company, until August 2021. He has since \nworked as a legal transcriptionist. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had three medical debts in collection for $2,477, \n$1,265, and $51, respectively (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i), and six delinquent consumer \naccounts totaling $7,104 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h). The allegations are established by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his August 2022 security clearance application \n(SCA), his February 2023 response to interrogatories, and credit bureau reports from \nSeptember 2022 and March 2023. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to minimal income, an employment \nlayoff in January 2017, underemployment in March 2019, and an in-state relocation in \nAugust 2021. He planned to file bankruptcy or seek other debt relief programs to \nresolve his delinquent debts, but he did not provide documentation of his efforts. (Items \n2-3) \nApplicant\u2019s three medical debts stem from an emergency visit that required him \nto have oral surgery. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f are for credit cards, in collection for \n$1,221, $814, $652, and $200, respectively. (Items 2-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a $3,533 charged-off credit line with an online retailer. It is reported \non the September 2022 credit bureau report. Although the March 2023 credit bureau \nreport reflects a zero balance for this debt, it also notes that this account was 150 days \npast due, charged to profit and loss, and purchased by another lender. Applicant did not \nprovide documentation to show that he resolved this debt. (Items 2-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is an auto loan past due in the amount of $664, with an outstanding \nbalance of $15,960. It is reported on the September 2022 credit bureau report. The \nMarch 2023 credit bureau report also reflects a zero balance for this debt, but it notes \nthat there may be a balance due after the \u201cmerchandise was taken back by grantor\u201d and \nthat the account was charged to profit and loss. Applicant did not provide \ndocumentation to show that he resolved this debt.

(Item 3) \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant has received credit counseling. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his delinquent debts. \nHowever, Applicant failed to show that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. \nHe did not provide documentation of his efforts to resolve any of his debts. There is no \nevidence that he has received credit counseling. There are not clear indications that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. I find that Applicant\u2019s \nongoing financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He has been employed with the DOD contractor since November 2022. He \npreviously worked for another DOD contractor from August 2014 to August 2022. He \ninitially received a security clearance in 2014 while working for this DOD contractor. He \nwas unemployed from September 2022 to October 2022. He has some college credits. \nHe is single, has no children, and currently lives with his parents and brother. (Tr.23-29; \nGE 1) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names \nof witnesses, locations, or other sensitive information in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and \nhis family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.) \nUnder the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from May 2018 to at least September 2022, including while \ngranted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE \n1, Section 23 at 25-26; Tr. 26) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegation. He listed his \nmarijuana use in response to Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity of his \nNovember 2022 security clearance application. He also indicated he received a medical \ncannabis card from the state in early 2022. He states he used a marijuana edible in \n2018. He indicated he suffered from chronic pain these past few years and believed it \nwould provide some relief. He tried a couple more times after his first use. He recently \ntried marijuana again in 2022 after receiving the medical cannabis card. He last used \nmarijuana in September 2022. He felt the marijuana did not provide much relief and \ncancelled his medical marijuana card. (GE 1, section 25-26) \nApplicant suffers from a chronic debilitating illness which causes him to endure a \nsignificant amount of pain.

(Tr. 14-17) \nApplicant\u2019s second surgery occurred in June 2019 because his symptoms and \nissues had returned. The second surgery was successful for a while. He was given pain \nmedication from his doctor. In 2022, his health issues returned and he underwent a \nthird surgery on May 2022. (Tr. 18-19) \nOn March 30, 2022, Applicant decided to apply for medical marijuana cannabis \ncard. The use of medical marijuana is legal in the state where he resides and works. \nThe card was approved on April 26, 2022. The state advised Applicant to take this card \nto his provider for certification and then to any state-licensed dispensary to purchase \ncannabis. (AE A, enclosure 5) Applicant testified that he did not have his cannabis card \ncertified by his medical provider. He was not aware that he needed to do this. His \nmother also has a state medical cannabis card. She gave Applicant a marijuana \ncapsule in September 2022 after his third surgery. He wanted to try it again to see if \nmarijuana would be a helpful pain management option. He decided the marijuana was \nnot helping his symptom so he turned in his medical marijuana card to the state on \nOctober 27, 2022. (Tr. 19-21, 39-41; AE A, enclosure 6) \nUnder cross-examination, Department Counsel questioned Applicant about his \nalleged statement during his background investigation interview that he used marijuana \na total of five times between May 2018 and September 2022. (GE 2 at 2) Applicant \ntestified that he may have ingested two marijuana edibles on two occasions during the \nweekend he first used marijuana in May 2018. He indicates he used a marijuana \ncapsule on one occasion in September 2022. While there may be some inconsistencies \nabout the number of times Applicant used marijuana, I do not find them to be material. \n(Tr. 32-34) \nThe third surgery really improved Applicant\u2019s health. He currently only needs to \ntake Tylenol to treat his pain episodes. He does not intend to use marijuana again. On \nFebruary 14, 2024, he signed a sworn statement of intent to refrain from marijuana use \nand other illegal drugs. He acknowledges that any future use of marijuana or other \nillegal drugs will result in the loss of his security clearance. (Tr. 21-22; AE A, enclosure \n8) \nWhole-person Factors \nMr. A, Applicant\u2019s former Operations Lead and Supervisor, wrote a letter on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. He has worked closely with him since November 2021. He states \nApplicant has a strong work ethic and leadership qualities that made a lasting impact on \nthe organization.

(AE A, section 7 at 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production \nand distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive \nposition are prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nThe December 21, 2021, memo also states the use of CBD products may be \nrelevant to adjudication in accordance with SEAD 4. Although the passage of the \nAgricultural Improvement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from the definition of marijuana \nwithin the Controlled Substances Act, products containing greater than a 0.3 percent \nconcentration of delta-9 tetrahyrdocannabinol (THC), a psychoactive ingredient in \nmarijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d Accordingly, products labeled as hemp-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nderived that contain greater than 0.3 percent THC continue to meet the legal definition \nof marijuana, and therefore remain illegal under to use under federal law and policy. \nAdditionally, agencies should be aware that the percentage of THC cannot be \nguaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal \nlaw. Studies have shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC \nthreshold for hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels. Therefore, there is a risk that \nusing these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THS to result in \na positive marijuana test under agency-administered employment of random drug \ntesting programs. Should an individual test positive, they will be subject to an \ninvestigation under specific guidelines established by their home agency. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted to access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana on several occasions \nfrom May 2018 until September 2022. Specifically, he used marijuana several times in \n2018 and on one occasion in September 2022. He did not purchase the marijuana, but \nhe possessed it when he used it. He admits he was granted access to classified \ninformation, but claims he worked on unclassified tasks. The nature of his work would \nbe considered sensitive. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(f) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)) \n \n \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions apply to the \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was infrequent. He \nused it no more than five times, several times in 2018 and once in September 2022, \nmore than 18 months ago. His reason for using marijuana was to see if it would alleviate \nthe pain related to his chronic medical condition. In 2022, he was under the mistaken \nbelief that he could use marijuana because he had a state-issued medical marijuana \ncard. The marijuana did not provide much pain relief. He soon surrendered his state-\nissued medical marijuana card in October 2022. Applicant did not try marijuana in order \nto get high. He was looking for pain relief. His third surgery has been successful and he \ndoes not suffer as much pain. Applicant\u2019s decision to use marijuana occurred under \nunusual circumstances. It is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current, \nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. He disclosed his marijuana use on his \nNovember 2022 security clearance application. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use on his most \nrecent security clearance application and during the hearing. He has established a \npattern of abstinence. The last time he tried marijuana was 18 months ago. Each time \nhe used marijuana he ingested a THC gummy or capsule. He did not smoke it. He \nprovided a sworn and notarized statement of intent to abstain from illegal drugs. He \nacknowledged that any future use of illegal drugs may result in the revocation of his \nsecurity clearance. He was forthcoming about his marijuana use on his security \nclearance application and during the hearing. He admits he was wrong when he used \nmarijuana between 2018 and 2022 after being granted a security clearance and \nemployed in a sensitive position. His last use of marijuana was in September 2022.

He was never a habitual marijuana \nuser, his intention was to seek pain relief for his chronic medical condition. \nApplicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline \nH, Drug Involvement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThere are reasons that support not granting a security clearance to Applicant. \nQuestions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of his admitted history of \nillegal drug use. I find the mitigating reasons outweigh the disqualifying reasons in \nApplicant\u2019s case. He fully disclosed his marijuana use on his November 2022 security \nclearance application. He has not smoked marijuana since September 2022. His use \nwas minimal. He signed a statement of intent to refrain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse and acknowledged that any future substance misuse could result in \nthe revocation of his security clearance. I considered the letters from two of Applicant\u2019s \nco-workers. He is highly regarded at his place of employment. A close personal friend \nalso attests to his good character. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has learned a significant \nlesson. While his marijuana use showed poor judgment, especially after being granted a \nsecurity clearance, he fully disclosed his marijuana use on his most recent security \nclearance application, and accepted responsibility for his actions. While his search for \npain relief for his chronic medical condition does not grant him permission under federal \nlaw to use marijuana, one can easily understand his reasons for trying it. He tried \nmarijuana only on a few occasions. He learned from his mistake in judgment and took \nsteps to demonstrate his intent to refrain from illegal marijuana use. Applicant is aware \nthat should he illegally use marijuana in the future, it is likely that his security clearance \nwill be revoked.

On \nMay 10, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DCSA CAS acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

On February 8, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on March 14, 2024. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until March 29, 2024, to enable \nhim to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Appellant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A, \nwhich was admitted without objection.

(Tr. 17-18) When he responded to DOHA interrogatories in May \n2023, he stated that he left this job because of COVID-19. He also stated that he was \nfired. (GX 2 at 9) \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from April 2023 \n(GX 3), October 2022 (GX 4), and October 2022 (GX 5), and three court records. (GX 5, \n6, and 7). The evidence of these debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-union debt placed for collection of $11,113. This debt was \nfor a credit card that Applicant used for living expenses. (Tr. 37) It was placed for \ncollection in April 2019 (GX 3 at 3). It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-union debt placed for collection of $583. This debt was for \nan overdrawn bank account. (Tr. 41) It was placed for collection in July 2019. (GX 3 at 4) \nIt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-union debt placed for collection of $14,459. This debt was \nfor a second credit card from the credit union alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Tr. 42-43) It was \nplaced for collection in April 2019. (GX 3 at 4) It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: finance company debt charged off for $1,404. This debt was for a \nsecured loan from a commercial finance company. The last payment was in March 2019. \n(GX 8 at 8) It was charged off in June 2019. (GX 3 at 6) It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: delinquent rent payment placed for collection of $1,259. Applicant \ntestified that he paid his rent two or three days after the due date. According to Applicant, \nthe landlord accepted the late payment and then returned a week later and told him he \nwas being evicted. (Tr. 47) He was evicted from an apartment and a default judgment \nwas entered against him. (GX 2 at 20-22) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: judgment for $203. The SOR alleges that this was a judgment. \nHowever, the evidence reflects that it is a past-due fine and court costs for a speeding \nticket in July 2018. (GX 6) It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: judgment for $1,837. This judgment was entered in March 2020. The \nbasis for the judgment is not reflected in the record. It is not satisfied. (GX 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: judgment for $134. The SOR alleges that this debt was reduced to a \njudgment. However, the evidence reflects that this was not a civil judgment. It is a past-\ndue fine and court costs based on a citation for defective equipment on a vehicle. (GX 7) \nIt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: unemployment compensation benefit warrant for $27,283. \nApplicant testified that he was concerned about contacts with other people and their \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nvehicles during the COVID-19 pandemic, and he stopped going to work at the car \ndealership for about a month, but he kept in contact with his manager. He provided a copy \nof a text message from his employer on April 7, 2020, which states, \nI wanted to let all of you know that tomorrow, 4/8, we\u2019re delaying the opening \nof the store until 1:00 pm (this affects all departments). It\u2019s critical that you \nlog in to Workday tomorrow morning at 10:00 am to receive an important \nupdate from [supervisor] about our response to the Coronavirus pandemic. \nWhile I do not have any additional information to share at this time, please \ncontact me directly if you have questions or concerns. I also ask that you \nrespond to this text to acknowledge you understand the guidance for \ntomorrow. \nSeveral recipients acknowledged receipt of this message, but there is no indication \nthat Applicant acknowledged receipt. (AX A) Applicant testified that when he was unable \nto log into the system, he went to the work site and learned he was not in the \u201cWorkday\u201d \nsystem. He contacted his manager, who told him, \u201cWe let you go.\u201d In his response to \nDOHA interrogatories, he stated that he was fired. (GX 2 at 9) He testified that he is \nworking with a lawyer to overturn the decision, but the issue is not resolved. (Tr. 51-53) \nApplicant has not taken any steps to resolve any of the debts alleged in the SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h. The debt for unemployment compensation is being collected by garnishment. \n(Tr. 55) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2023, he \nreported that net monthly income was about $5,361 and that his net remainder after \npaying all his living expenses was $3,161. (GX 2 at 15) At the hearing, he testified that \nhis monthly expenses have gone up somewhat, because he has expenses related to \nsupporting his child, but he still has a net monthly remainder. He does not pay court-\nordered child support, but he contributes about $600 per month for daycare and shares \nthe cost of food and clothing. (Tr. 29, 61) He is seeking to buy a home, and he has been \nadvised by a mortgage lender that resolving the charged-off debts reflected on his credit \nreports is not necessary. (Tr. 64) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in August 2022, he listed two addresses where \nhe had lived during the last ten years in Section 11, but he did not list the two most recent \naddresses. This omission was alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, which was withdrawn. \nIn Section 13A of the same SCA, pertaining to his employment record, he listed \nhis current employment, his military service, and one job that he held before enlisting in \nthe Navy. He did not list his employment by the construction materials company, the \nhighway construction company, and the car dealership. This omission was alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.b, which was withdrawn. \nIn Section 26 of the same SCA, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions asking if, in the last \nseven years, he had been delinquent on alimony or child support payments, had a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment entered against him, or had a lien placed against him for failing to pay taxes or \nother debts. He did not disclose the judgment against him alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g and the \nunemployment compensation benefit warrant filed against him alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions in the same section, asking if, in the \nlast seven years, he had any possessions or property repossessed; had defaulted on any \nloans; had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit \ncard suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay the debt as agreed; been \nevicted for non-payment; had wages, benefits, or assessed garnished or attached for any \nreason; and if he was currently over 120 days delinquent on any debt. He did not disclose \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i. These omissions were alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nIn Section 28 of the SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether, in the \nlast ten years, he had been a party to any public record civil court action not listed \nelsewhere in the SCA. He did not disclose the judgement alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. This \nomission was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, which was withdrawn. \nWhen a security investigator questioned Applicant about his debts in January \n2023, he said that he did not know he was required to report his financial problems and \nthat he did not intend to resolve his debts or contact his creditors. He told the investigator \nthat mortgage lenders told him not to worry about his debts because they were charged \noff. He told the investigator that he would satisfy his delinquent debts only if it was required \nto keep his security clearance. (GX 2 at 15) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was deployed when he submitted his \nSCA, did not pay attention to questions, and \u201centirely blew\u201d the section about delinquent \ndebts. He testified that he would \u201cdefinitely consider\u201d paying off his delinquent debts if \nnecessary to keep his job or his security clearance. (Tr. 57-59) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

Applicant\u2019s discharge from the Navy was a \ncondition largely beyond his control. His termination in March 2019 may have been a \ncondition beyond his control. However, his loss of employment in December 2019 and \nMarch 2020 were both due to his decisions to absent himself from work without approval \nof his supervisor. Furthermore, he has not acted responsibly toward the debts he incurred \nwhile unemployed. He submitted no evidence of contacts with creditors, payments, or \npayment agreements. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments, \npayment agreements, or other efforts to resolve his debts. His debt for the unemployment \nbenefits is being collected by garnishment, which is not a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to resolve a \ndebt. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. While Applicant may have mistakenly believed he \nwas entitled to unemployment benefits, the evidence shows that he was \u201clet go\u201d because \nhe failed to come to work for a month. He testified that he intends to contest the effort to \nrecoup the unemployment benefits, but he provided no documentation of any effort to do \nso. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification.

See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing reflected that he did not appreciate the \nrelationship between his delinquent debts and his suitability for a security clearance. He \nalso did not appreciate the importance of the SCA in the adjudication process. He did not \ntake the time to properly complete Sections 11, 13A, 26, and 28 of the SCA. He admitted \nthat he \u201cblew\u201d the financial part of the SCA, but he has offered no plausible explanation \nfor failing to disclose that he left three jobs under unfavorable circumstances. \nThe SOR allegations of falsifying Sections 11, 13A, and 28 were withdrawn by \ndepartment counsel and may not be the basis for denying Applicant\u2019s application. \nHowever, I may consider these omissions from his SCA to determine whether he has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; to assess credibility, or to provide evidence for \nwhole person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I \nhave considered Applicant\u2019s failure to fully disclose information in Sections 11, 13A, 26, \nand 28 for these limited purposes. In this regard, I have noted that the Directive provides \nthat \u201cany failure\u201d to provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative processes \u201ccan raise questions about a person\u2019s eligibility for a clearance.\u201d \nIt does not expressly limit the concern to deliberately false statements. See ISCR Case \nNo. 17-02520 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2019). \nBased on the foregoing considerations, I conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) is established \nby the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not acknowledge his delinquent debts \nuntil he was confronted with the evidence by a security investigator in January 2023. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications were recent, involving his \ncurrent SCA, and they were not minor.

Aug. 8, 2002) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. I have also considered his lack of understanding of the \nrelationship between financial responsibility and suitability for a security clearance. I have \nconsidered his lack of appreciation for the necessity of complete and accurate information \nin an SCA so that the government can make sound decisions, based on complete and \naccurate information, about who will be granted access to classified information. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and his lack of candor \nin his SCA. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nWithdrawn \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.c and 2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. at 18-19, 32-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nApplicant used marijuana as a youth, and then went decades without using \nmarijuana. He resumed his use in about September 2019, about the same time he \nbecame involved with BDSM. His marijuana use was also connected to his childhood \ntrauma. A friend who was a Vietnam veteran told him that marijuana helped with his \nPTSD symptoms. Applicant used marijuana in various forms almost every night. He \nusually used it alone, but he also used it occasionally during his extramarital \nencounters. At the time, medical marijuana did not violate state law, but recreational \nmarijuana had not yet become permitted under state law. Applicant knew that marijuana \nuse violated federal law, was against his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy, and \nwas inconsistent with his responsibilities as a clearance holder. He held a security \nclearance at the time, but he did not have access to classified information. He initially \nbought marijuana from individuals who received it from medical marijuana dispensaries. \nAfter his state law changed to permit recreational marijuana use, he bought the \nmarijuana from dispensaries himself.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant purchased, possessed, and used marijuana from about September \n2019 to June 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant\u2019s marijuana use \u201cwhile granted access to classified \ninformation.\u201d He held a security clearance when he used marijuana, but he did not have \naccess to classified information. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for \nApplicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2022 and charged with \ndriving under the influence of liquor, drugs, or vapors. It also alleges that the charge \nwas dismissed. Applicant had marijuana and paraphernalia in the car. He stated that he \nhad nothing to drink. He used marijuana the night before, but nothing the day he was \ndriving. The SOR did not allege Applicant\u2019s possession of marijuana and paraphernalia \nunder this allegation. Rather, it alleges that he drove while under the influence of \nmarijuana. I am unable to find by substantial evidence that he did so. SOR \u00b6 1.d is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (the Security Executive \nAgent (SecEA)) issued DNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the SecEA promulgated clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether \nthe individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including \nby signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation.

He knew that \nmarijuana use violated federal law, was against his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace \npolicy, and was inconsistent with his responsibilities as a clearance holder. He did not \nreport his marijuana use until after he was arrested for DUI during which the police \nofficer noted what appeared to be marijuana and paraphernalia in the car. \nApplicant credibly testified that he has not used any illegal drugs since he last \nused marijuana in June 2022. He attended AA, NA, and SA meetings. He is actively \ninvolved with an online community of men who are in recovery; he attends in-person \nmeetings once a week; and he sees a counselor once a week. He embraced his faith, \nand he has turned to meditation and prayer instead of sex and marijuana. He no longer \nassociates with any of the individuals with whom he used illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future \nwas sincere and credible. However, it does not mitigate the extremely poor judgment he \ndisplayed when he used marijuana on an almost daily basis for several years while \nholding a security clearance. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficient to \nmitigate Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use while holding a security clearance. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nApplicant engaged in a series of extramarital sexual encounters in which he \nexplored BDSM with other consenting adults. He estimated that he had about 150 \npartners. His wife did not know about his conduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(b), 13(c), and 13(d) are \napplicable. The SOR did not allege that the conduct was criminal, and the evidence did \nnot establish that it was criminal. AG \u00b6 13(a) is not applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant \u201cengaged in extramarital sexual encounters \nsince about September 2019.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant\u2019s \u201cspouse is not aware \nof the full extent of [his] extramarital sexual encounters.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b does not allege any \nconduct that is not already alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a; and it does not raise any additional \ndisqualifying conditions; it merely pleads an aggravating factor or a lack of mitigation. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant kept his extramarital sexual encounters secret. He told his wife about \nthem at the same time he told her about his marijuana use. He also informed his family, \npeople at work, and his church. He has not been involved in any extramarital activities \nsince he told his wife. She attends therapy with him from a certified sex addiction \ntherapist. He attended AA, NA, and SA meetings. He is actively involved with an online \ncommunity of men who are in recovery, and he attends in-person meetings once a \nweek. He embraced his faith, and he has turned to meditation and prayer instead of sex \nand marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, \nor duress; and it does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) are applicable. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while granted access to \nclassified information. As addressed under Guideline H, Applicant held a security \nclearance, but he did not have access to classified information. That language in the \nallegation is concluded for Applicant. SOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s extramarital \nsexual encounters. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use and extramarital sexual encounters reflect \nquestionable judgment and created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. His marijuana use also reveals an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to the extramarital sexual \nencounters. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable to the marijuana use because that \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D, E, and H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline D, but he did not mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guidelines E and H. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant) \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

He is 50 years old, \nmarried, and he has an adult child. He served honorably in the U.S. military from \nJanuary 1992 until he retired in February 2018. He has since worked as a senior \nlogistics analyst for his employer, a DOD contractor. He was first granted a security \nclearance while he served in the U.S. military.

The allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his May 2022 background \ninterview with an authorized DOD investigator, and a credit bureau report from April \n2022. (Items 1, 2, 8) \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he did not realize how \ndelinquent his debts had become. He acknowledged that he procrastinated paying his \ndebts, but he planned to pull a copy of his credit bureau report and make payment \narrangements for his delinquent accounts no later than May 2022. In his Answer, he \nstated that: (1) he would settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a by the end of May 2023; (2) the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.b was no longer delinquent and carried a balance of $700; and (3) he \npaid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in May 2023. He did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his claims. Credit bureau reports from November 2022 and January 2023 \ndo not reflect any delinquent debts. The 2023 credit bureau report also reflects that \nthree accounts with the same original creditor as that of SOR \u00b6 1.b were current. (Items \n2, 5-7) \nApplicant estimated during his background interview that his net monthly salary, \nwhich included $2,792 in military retirement pay, was $7,334, and his monthly net \nremainder after expenses was $3,117. He also indicated that he had $15,000 in his \nbank savings account. He had not received any financial counseling. (Item 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(b), an \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his debts, despite having the financial \nmeans to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control did not contribute to his delinquent debts, \nas Applicant indicated during his background interview that he did not realize how \ndelinquent his debts had become and he acknowledged that he procrastinated paying \nthem. The 2023 credit bureau report, which reflects that three accounts with the same \noriginal creditor as that of SOR \u00b6 1.b were current, corroborates Applicant\u2019s claim that \nthis debt is no longer delinquent. I find that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHowever, Applicant failed to provide proof that he settled or otherwise resolved \nthe significant debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, or that he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Although these \ndebts are no longer reported on his most recent credit reports, they were reported on \nthe April 2022 credit bureau report. He has the financial means to resolve these debts, \nbut he failed to provide documentation reflecting his efforts to do so. There is no \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence that he has received credit counseling.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established \nfor SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

This incident was related to \nher frustration about her movement disorder. \nSummary of the Facts \nApplicant experienced several traumatic events when she was a child. At age 11, \nshe was diagnosed with PTSD. In 2017, her husband was notified by the Navy that he \nwas to be mobilized for a year-long deployment. Applicant was concerned because they \ndid not live in a neighborhood where she felt safe. Their three cars were broken into on \nfour occasions and the police were not responsive when she contacted them for help. In \naddition, drug dealers lived in the neighborhood. Applicant became hypervigilant and \nparanoid about the safety to her family. Her husband returned from deployment in the \nsummer of 2018. (Tr 23, 31-32; AE C) \nApplicant initially sought mental health treatment with a licensed professional \ncounselor, Ms. L.M. around 2017. She told Ms. L.M. that her husband\u2019s absence, the car \nbreak-ins, and the lack of response from the police triggered feelings of fear that went \nback to her troubled youth. She also told her that she was having chronic issues with \nphysical symptoms that caused her to fall forward. She also had brain fog, memory \nissues, and a movement disorder where her fingers, hands, and feet seemed to move by \nthemselves. Ms. L.M. told her that it was due to her body being in a prolonged period of \nfight-or-flight response. Applicant also consulted a neurologist about her involuntary \nmovement issues. She was diagnosed with a movement disorder not otherwise specified \nand was told there were no treatments available to her. This caused her to have greater \ndepressive symptoms. In 2019, she began to have suicidal ideations because she began \nto lose hope about the future. (AE C) \nAround 2018, Applicant switched to another provider whose name she does not \nrecall, when she got a new job. The new provider diagnosed her with Major Depressive \ndisorder, PTSD, and alcohol abuse. She saw the provider over a period of six months to \na year. She was prescribed the anti-depressant Wellbutrin. She admits to drinking heavily \nduring this time, around nine to 12 drinks daily because she felt it was the only way she \ncould sleep.

She became severely depressed \nand suicidal because she and her family were moving to another state, which meant she \nhad to quit her job and start over. She drank between 9-12 alcoholic drinks that evening. \nShe argued with her husband and went to bed. She took a chef\u2019s knife with her into the \nbedroom and put it on her bedside table. She claims she usually took her chef\u2019s knife with \nher to bed for security. Her daughter saw the knife and called the police over concern that \nher mother was suicidal. When the police arrived, they asked her if she was going to hurt \nherself and she responded affirmatively. She was first taken to an emergency room but \nwas transferred to a local mental health treatment facility where she was put under \nobservation for 72 hours. At the end of the observation period, she was evaluated by a \njudge. The judge released her but told her to get treatment after she moved with her family \nto their new location. One month after moving, Applicant began seeing N.P. S.C, who \nwas affiliated with a neuro-psychological wellness center. Applicant has met with her on \na regular and recurring basis since September 2019 for medication management and \ncounseling. (Tr. 25 \u2013 28, 41; AE C) \nAfter Applicant and her family moved to the new location, her symptoms of PTSD, \nhypervigilance, depression, and suicidality improved because they moved to a much safer \nneighborhood. She continued to struggle with insomnia. After the June 2019 incident, she \nstopped drinking alcohol. As a result, her insomnia increased. She sometimes was only \nable to sleep two hours a night. In November 2021, she went six days without sleep and \nhad an episode of wakeful dreaming. She drove her car into a ditch. A bystander called \npolice. The police observed that Applicant was speaking gibberish. An ambulance was \ncalled and she was taken to a hospital where she received medical care. She was \nevaluated by a mental health provider but was not hospitalized in a mental health \ntreatment facility. She stayed one night in the hospital. Medical tests indicated she had \nno alcohol or illegal drugs in her system. She was prescribed Olanzapine which helped \nher sleep for the first time in six days. She did not report the incident to her FSO because \nshe believed it was medical issue related to her insomnia as opposed to a mental health \nissue. Since this incident, she has been prescribed and takes Olanzapine on a regular \nbasis. The medication allows her to sleep 10-12 hours a night which she has done \nconsistently since 2021. (Tr. 23-29: AE C) \nApplicant\u2019s provider, N.P. S.C. prescribed Olanzapine for her sleep issues. She \nalso prescribed Trazadone which helps with her PTSD, anxiety, and paranoia. She \nprescribed Diazepam for her movement disorder. The movement disorder is now under \ncontrol. At the beginning of an episode, she takes Diazepam and it stops the episode \nfrom happening. (Tr. 34; AE C) \nEvaluation of Government-Approved Psychologist \nDr. J.S., a licensed psychologist, was retained by DCSA CAS to evaluate \nApplicant. He met with her on October 15, 2022. The evaluation was conducted via secure \nvideo teleconference. Applicant consented to the evaluation being conducted via video-\nteleconference instead of an in-person evaluation. Dr. J.S.\u2019s report of evaluation is located \nat GE 4.

Regarding the June \n2019 incident which lead to Applicant\u2019s involuntary hospitalization, Applicant admitted that \nshe was \u201cin a very bad place\u201d during that time. She had been experiencing paranoia and \nstruggling with suicidal thoughts for about three months before her hospitalization. She \ndenied any intention of harming herself but said she took the chef\u2019s knife into her bedroom \nbecause \u201cit gave her a sense of control that I could end it if I wanted to.\u201d She admitted \nthat she may have made and offhand comment to the admitting staff at the hospital about \nwanting to shoot herself with a gun. She could not recall the exact details because she \nwas heavily intoxicated that evening. \nWith regard to her alcohol and drug history, Applicant described her heaviest \nperiod of alcohol consumption occurred from mid \u2013 2018 to June 2019. She drank six \nbeers a night to help her sleep. She has abstained from alcohol use since her \nhospitalization in 2019. She denied any current or historical use of illegal drugs. \nDr. J.S. described Applicant\u2019s mental status during the interview as \u201calert and fully \noriented.\u201d The PAI assessment indicated she answered questions in a manner which may \nhave minimized some of her faults and shortcomings. These minimizations are generally \ncommon given the evaluative nature of these interviews. He noted that she reported \nproblems of greater intensity than is typical of individuals who are attempting to positively \nreport. She reported unusual sensory motor problems, preoccupations with physical \nfunctioning, frequent physical complaints, tension and apprehension, and physical signs \nof depression. Her responses did not reveal any other significant or severe psychological \nissues. She is mostly confident, resilient, and optimistic. Her assertiveness, friendliness, \nand concern for others is typical of normal adults. \n \nDr. J.S. contacted N.P. S.C., Applicant\u2019s current mental health provider. She told \nhim that she has been treating Applicant since September 2019. Applicant meets with her \non average of every six weeks. This varies based on Applicant\u2019s medication needs. N.P. \nS.C. told him that Applicant has several diagnoses to include depression, PTSD, \nparanoia, and sleep disturbances. At the time she conferred with Dr. J.S., N.P. S.C. \nindicated Applicant\u2019s issues were well managed under her regimen of Gabapentin, \nTrazadone and Olanzapine. She also confirmed Applicant\u2019s previous alcohol use and \ncurrent abstinence. \n \n \nN.P. S.C. told Dr. J.S. that subject has fears that her husband will leave her. This \ncontributes to her anxiety, sleep issues, and paranoia.

She had been \u201cspeaking gibberish\u201d and was \nclearly impaired. She was assessed and kept for stabilization. Lab results were negative \nfor drugs and alcohol. She regained cognitive awareness and admitted that she had not \nbeen sleeping for six days. She recovered. N.P. S.C. began to prescribe her Olanzapine \nwhich has been successful. Applicant is getting more restful sleep, and, in turn, reducing \nher experiences of paranoia. N.P. S.C mentioned Applicant has been stable since the \nNovember 2021 incident. She told him that Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness were intact, contingent on her being compliant in her medication plan. \nApplicant has always been transparent and motivated to be stable. \nDr. J.S. diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol use disorder, mild, in sustained \nremission; Delusional disorder, persecutory type; major depressive disorder, mild, \nrecurrent, in partial remission, and PTSD. \nDr. J.S. is concerned that Applicant did not report the November 2021 incident to \nhim during the evaluation for three reasons. First, the incident is recent and shows \nApplicant was still affected by factors listed above to the extent it caused her significant \ncognitive impairment. Second, she did not reach out to her prescriber or emergency \nservices during the decompensation period, indicating a lack of insight into her condition, \nor reluctance to ask for help. Finally, he believes Applicant may have intentionally \nwithheld this significant event during her interview. For this reason, he cannot provide a \nfavorable recommendation based upon these concerns and presence of a diagnosis \nwhich can, and has caused deficits in judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nEvaluation of Applicant by Dr. E.S., Psy. D.  \nOn October 6, 2023, Dr. E.S., a licensed clinical psychologist, conducted a full \nneuropsychological evaluation of current cognitive and emotional functioning on \nApplicant.

(AE G at 1) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline may be applicable: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors:  \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) applies. Applicant has a history of mental health issues related to \nanxiety, depression, and PTSD. She has become suicidal on several occasions in the \npast. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies because Dr. J.S., a duly qualified mental health professional, \nevaluated Applicant in 2021 at the request of DCSA CAS. He concluded that her condition \nmay impair judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(c) applies with \nregards to Applicant\u2019s hospitalization in June 2019 after expressing suicidal ideations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and  \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s condition is readily controllable with \ntreatment. In the past, she has sought mental health counseling. Since the fall 2019, she \nhas met on a consistent basis with N.P. S.C., a certified Nurse Practitioner and a graduate \nof a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner\u2019s Master\u2019s Program. Applicant has been consistent \nand compliant with her treatment plan for over five years. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) applies because Applicant voluntarily entered into treatment with N.P. \nS.C., a qualified nurse practitioner, since September 2019. She regularly attends \ntreatment is compliant with her treatment plan and medications. Both N.P. S.C. and Dr. \nE. S., a licensed psychologist in the same practice, gave Applicant a favorable prognosis \nas long as she takes her medication and follows her treatment plan.    \nAG \u00b6 29(c) does not apply because Dr. J.S., the psychologist tasked by U.S. \nGovernment to evaluate Applicant did not give her a favorable prognosis because she \ndid not disclose the November 2021 incident where she was hospitalized after not \nsleeping for six days. Other than this one issue, Dr. J.S.\u2019s comments and conclusions \nwere favorable to Applicant. Applicant testified that she did not disclose the November \n2021 incident to Dr. J.S. because she believed the incident involved a medical issue \nrelated to her insomnia as opposed to a mental health issue. I find her testimony credible \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nbecause she has been forthcoming about her mental health issues throughout the \nsecurity clearance process. I believe her failure to disclose the November 2021 incident \nto Dr. J.S. was unintentional. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) applies because there is no indication of a current problem. While \nApplicant has endured some serious mental health issues, she has taken steps to deal \nwith her issues. She stopped drinking alcohol. She has been under the care of a nurse \npractitioner specializing in treating psychiatric issues for over five years. She consistently \nfollows the recommended treatment plan and takes her medications. She has been \nprescribed the appropriate medication for her insomnia that allows her to sleep an \naverage of 10 hours each night. Based on the above considerations, I conclude that the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline I are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s cooperation \nthroughout her background investigation. I considered her favorable employment history \nas a contractor for the U.S. government. I considered the support she receives from her \nhusband and family members. I considered her willingness to seek help for her mental \nhealth issues. I considered that she has not had a significant mental health episode since \nNovember 2021. \nI considered the favorable prognosis of N.P. S.C., the psychiatric nurse practitioner \nwho has treated her since the fall 2019 as well as Dr. E.S., the license psychologist from \nthe same practice, who assessed Applicant. While Dr. J.S., the licensed psychologist \ncontracted by the government to assess Applicant, did not give her an overall favorable \nrecommendation, I give more weight to the recommendations of the mental health \npersonnel who have met with and treated Applicant on a regular basis over the past five \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nyears. They note that Applicant follows her treatment plan and takes her medications. \nDuring the hearing, it was clear that Applicant has actively taken steps to improve her \nhealth and stability. There is no indication of a current problem. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns raised under the Psychological Conditions. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Items 6-8.)   \nIn his explanations, Applicant cited \u201ca few professional and personal matters that \nhave affected [his] focus.\u201d He also said that he has been working \u201con a very demanding \ncontract\u201d that became \u201coverwhelming.\u201d He also pointed to \u201csome personal tragedies, . . . \nincluding the loss of a few loved ones\u201d and \u201cugly family matters that came from it.\u201d He \nreferred to 2021 \u201cpayment arrangements\u201d with \u201cthe majority of debt holders\u201d and is \nworking with a CPA to address tax issues. He claimed he mailed his 2020 return and \nreceived a \u201crebate\u201d (times not stated). He did not provide any documents supporting his \nexplanations. (Item 2.) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used and purchased marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about August 2019 to about May 2021, including use after \nbeing granted a security clearance by DOD in April 2021. (Item 1.) He admitted that \nallegation with an explanation. He is certain that after he received confirmation of his \nclearance, he \u201cdid not engage in making any illegal purchases as [he] had before.\u201d He did \nnot provide the date in May 2021 when he received that confirmation, but he \u201cmay have \nfinished up what remaining product [he] had.\u201d He concluded his Answer as follows: \u201c[At] \nthe current time, I have been abiding by both US and Nation A federal laws, as well as \nthe considerations for my clearance, in this regard, and do not plan on engaging in any \nfurther risky behavior that might put myself or my work at risk.\u201d (Item 2.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \nIn Applicant\u2019s March 19, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI), Applicant \ndiscussed four of his delinquent consumer debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1f, 1.h, and 1,i. He did not \ndispute any of those debts. He either forgot to pay those debts or did not know why he \ndid not pay them. The summary of his closing statement encapsulates his plan for those \ndebts: \u201c[He] claimed he will contact each creditor that has a balance and make every \neffort to make out an arrangement to satisfy all delinquent debts in full.\u201d (Item 11.) He \nproduced no documents evidencing those efforts. \nIn his PSI, Applicant also discussed his marijuana use. He used marijuana from \nAugust 2019 until June 2020, when he stopped because he thought he was having an \nallergic reaction. When he learned in November 2020 that marijuana was not the cause \nof his symptoms, he resumed using marijuana. At the time of his PSI, his last use of \nmarijuana was in early March 2021. From August 2019 to February 2021, he purchased \nmarijuana about once a month from an unknown friend of a friend. He used marijuana \ntwo to four times per week. He always used it by himself at his home. He does not feel \ndependent on marijuana, and it makes him feel calm and less anxious. He would use \nmarijuana again unless he was not able to due to his clearance. (Item 11.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \nA2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe followings conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant \u201cfailed to pay, as required, Federal income tax \nreturns for the tax year 2020.\u201d Failure to \u201cpay Federal income tax returns\u201d is not a \n4 \n\n \n \n. . \ndisqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19(f). Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged that Applicant \u201cfailed to pay, as required, [state] income for the \ntax year 2020.\u201d \u201cFailure to pay, as required, [state] income\u201d is not a disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 19(f). Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. alleged that Applicant is indebted to the [state] for $339 for unpaid \nvehicle property taxes for tax year 2019. This tax debt is established by his admissions. \nTherefore, I find against him on SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nThe six consumer debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and three \nof the Government\u2019s credit reports. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. The total \namount of these delinquent debts is $3,765. The magnitude of those debts does not raise \nnational security concerns under Guideline F. Therefore, I find in favor of him on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d through 1.i. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nUnder AG H, illegal drug use may raise questions about a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, \nas follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . \npurchase; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nThe potentially applicable mitigating conditions here are quoted below: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nApplicant admitted in his most recent SCA, his PSI, and in his Answer that he \npurchased marijuana from August 2019 to February 2021 and used it until May 2021 or \nperhaps for some unspecified time after May 2021. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) apply. \nThe question is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nWith a pause from June to November 2020, Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana between August 2019 and May 2021 or perhaps a bit longer. That is not that \nlong ago, and using two to four times a week is not infrequent. His use was for about two \nyears. His abstinence has been for three years. There does not appear to be any unusual \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n. . \ncircumstances that contributed to his usage. Given that his period of abstinence is just \nslightly longer than his period of usage, I find that mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n(b) do not apply. \nThe SOR did not plead that Applicant engaged in \u201cillegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, AG \u00b6 26(f) does not \napply. In any event, in ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), the Appeal \nBoard held that access to classified information has two elements in addition to eligibility. \nThey are that: (1) an applicant must have signed a nondisclosure agreement (NDA); and \n(2) an applicant must have a need-to-know (NTK). Here, the record does not show that \nApplicant has signed an NDA and has a NTK. Thus, the record would not support an AG \n\u00b6 26(f) allegation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by financial considerations or drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n_____________________________ \n. . \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

She is discreet about what she does at work when \nspeaking with others. (Answer; Tr. 77-78) \nApplicant submitted character reference letters from several people she knows \nwell, either personally or professionally. All of them attested to her fine character, \nincluding her dependability, trustworthiness, responsibility, honesty, dedication, \npatience, compassion, kindness, and sense of teamwork. (AE I) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts, of about $6,500, are sufficient to raise financial \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations) are raised by the evidence. While this is not a \ncomparative exercise, I note nonetheless that Applicant\u2019s SOR debts, as alleged, are \nwell less than $10,000. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts were incurred during the years after her divorce, as she \nstruggled to raise her family as a single mother. Her debts are due, at least in part, to \ncircumstances beyond her control. She also acknowledged that her own financial \nmismanagement and inexperience contributed to her debts. She is making a good-faith \neffort towards paying them off one by one. She has learned better financial \nmanagement with the help of her husband. While some of her debts remain, her current \npast-due debts now total less than $5,000, and she has a responsible, reasonable plan \nfor addressing them. They are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d). \nThe security concerns over Applicant\u2019s debts no longer create doubt about her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and \nconsidered that the favorable evidence substantially outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept, her credible \ntestimony, her several years of experience on the base where she works, and to her \nstrong character evidence, under the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude she provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \n \nConsidering all the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He noted that as of the evaluation, he was \nperiodically engaging in unwanted and excessive alcohol consumption, followed by up \nto two weeks of abstinence. When he drank, it was up to a fifth of liquor in an evening. \nHe stated that he did that for about one to four evenings and then, tired of his \nhangovers, he would stop for a while until he drank again. (Tr. at 49-52; GE 2, 5) \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, mild, with the \nfollowing diagnostic impression: \nWhile his drinking does not appear to impact his occupational \nperformance, he readily reports ongoing binge consumption of alcohol. He \nonly recently has resumed care with his psychiatrist to address his \ndrinking habits and ongoing symptoms of depression and anxiety that, \nhistorically, have been attributable to his drinking patterns.

However, he reported continued binge drinking that remains a \nsecurity concern relative to judgment, impulse control, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Moreover, he has failed to follow treatment advice once he \nwas diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder and continues to do so in his \ncurrent treatment with Dr. [Psychiatrist]. (GE 2) \nThe psychologist reported that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was guarded because Applicant \n\u201creports an insufficient period in which he has abstained from alcohol or, at least, \nconsumed alcohol in a moderate manner without binge drinking.\u201d (GE 2) \nApplicant admitted that his counselors and treatment providers recommended \nthat he not drink. He has been unable to completely stop drinking. He testified that he \nlast drank about two months before the hearing. He admitted that when he drinks, it is at \nhome and alone, he drinks heavily, and always to the point of intoxication. He stated \nthat he would drink for a few days in a row and then stop for a few months. He \nestimated that his longest period of sobriety since 2018 was about three or four months. \nHe has taken leave occasionally while hungover, but he does not drink at work, and it \ndoes not appear to have adversely affected his job performance. He admitted he is an \nalcoholic, and sobriety is his ultimate goal. (Tr. at 54-63) He emphasized during his \ntestimony: \nJust that the drinking doesn\u2019t affect my work. It doesn\u2019t -- I strive to not \ndrink all the time. Sometimes I go throughout the day without thinking \nabout it at all. Sometimes I\u2019m tempted to drink, and sometimes I succumb \nto that temptation. (Tr. at 61) \nApplicant called a witness, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to \nhis excellent job performance and strong moral character. The witness praised him for \nhis skill, expertise, productivity, and professionalism. The witness testified that any \nproblems Applicant had with alcohol never \u201cfollowed [him] to work.\u201d (Tr. at 64-65; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, C-E) \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) \nThe DSM-5 is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental \nhealth professionals in the United States.

The presence of \nfour to five symptoms is classified as moderate. The presence of six or more symptoms \nis classified as severe. \nMajor Depressive Disorder  \nThe criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly \nevery day to be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal \nideation. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; \npsychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall \nseverity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. \nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two \nweeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in \nnearly all activities. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., \npersistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming \nothers, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events). \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder  \nThe key feature of generalized anxiety disorders is persistent and excessive \nanxiety and worry about various domains, including work and school performance, that \nthe individual finds difficult to control. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe SOR alleged psychological conditions security concerns under Guideline I, \nand cross-alleged those concerns under Guideline G. The SOR alleged behavioral \nissues under Guideline I, but it never alleged that they were alcohol related. I find that \nAG \u00b6 22(a) was never alleged and therefore cannot be applicable. \nApplicant is a binge drinker who drinks heavily for a few days in a row and then \nstops for a period. He was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder by several medical \nprofessionals. His counselors and treatment providers recommended that he not drink, \nbut he has been unable to stop for more than a few months. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), \nand 22(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s drinking pattern is little changed over the last six years. He drinks \nheavily for a few days, then stays sober for a few months. He is an admitted alcoholic \nwho strives for sobriety, but he has thus far been unable to remain abstinent. He is \nurged to continue the fight. However, I have lingering concerns about his drinking.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s suicidal ideations, violent outburst resulting in the \ndestruction of a treadmill, and arrest for terroristic threats. Those incidents constitute \nbehavior that casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment and stability and may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition. AG \u00b6 28(a) is applicable to that behavior. \nSee USAF-M Case No. 23-00056-R at 3 (App. Bd.

Some conditions, such as psychotic disorder, \nschizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, bipolar mood disorder, \nborderline personality disorder, and antisocial personality disorder (none present in this \ncase), clearly impair judgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness, and by their very \nnature raise security concerns, and can be accepted as such without further elaboration \nby the mental health professional: Other conditions may require elaboration by the \nmental health professional as to how the condition may impair the individual\u2019s judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was diagnosed at various times with alcohol use \ndisorder, severe (SOR \u00b6 1.b), moderate (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and mild (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Alcohol use \ndisorder is a condition may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 \n28(b) is applicable to that diagnosis. \nApplicant was diagnosed with major depressive disorder (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) \nand generalized anxiety disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Major depressive disorder and \ngeneralized anxiety disorder are not conditions that by their very nature clearly impair \njudgment, stability, reliability, and trustworthiness. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 23-00706 \nat 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 2024) for major depressive disorder, and USAF-M Case No. 23-\n00056-R at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 4, 2024) for generalized anxiety disorder. Additionally, the \npsychologist who evaluated Applicant at the DoD\u2019s request did not diagnose those \nconditions. AG \u00b6 28(b) is not applicable to those diagnoses.  \nIn addition to alcohol use disorder and major depressive disorder, SOR \u00b6 1.c \nalleges that Applicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist diagnosed him \u201cwith a rule-out diagnosis of \nBipolar I Disorder.\u201d A \u201crule-out diagnosis\u201d is not a diagnosis. It is a medical term that \nmeans a doctor is trying to eliminate a possible diagnosis from a list of conditions for a \npatient. The language in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c referring to major depressive disorder, \ngeneralized anxiety disorder, and bipolar I disorder is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) \nApplicant was an inpatient for a mental health condition (SOR \u00b6 1.b). AG \u00b6 28(c) \nis applicable. \nAG \u00b6 28(d) \nApplicant continued to consume alcohol contrary to the medical advice of his \nproviders that he maintain sobriety (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). AG \u00b6 28(d) is applicable. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29 provides conditions that could mitigate psychological conditions security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nI believe this is primarily an alcohol case, but there is problematic behavior that \nmay not have involved alcohol. This is also a psychological conditions case. Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol and mental health issues are intertwined. At this time, his alcohol issues are \nunresolved, as are his mental health issues. None of the mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are sufficient to mitigate the psychological conditions security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and I in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines G and I. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst \nApplicant, \nexcept \nfor \nthe \nlanguage \u201cMajor Depressive Disorder \nsevere, recurrent, without psychosis, \nand \nGeneralized \nAnxiety \nDisorder,\u201d \nwhich is found For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst \nApplicant, \nexcept \nfor \nthe \nlanguage \u201cMajor Depressive Disorder \nrecurrent, severe\u201d and \u201cwith a rule-out \ndiagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

On \nApril 12, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F.

There were no \nobjections and GE 1 through 4 and AE A through E were admitted in evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent accounts totaling $31,597. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.g) In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations without \nexplanation. (Answer) His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36-years old and has been employed by a federal contractor as an \naerospace technician since April 2022. He worked as an automobile master technician, \nfield service technician, pest control technician, or rigger from February 2012 until \nJanuary 2022, except for periods of unemployment from January to April 2018 and about \ntwo months in early 2021. (GE 1; Tr. 32-47, 90-93) \nApplicant was born in Jamaica, entered the United States in March 2007, and was \nnaturalized in March 2021. He attended a motorcycle mechanic\u2019s school from December \n2008 to August 2011. He married in September 2007, divorced in July 2022, and has one \nchild, age 4. (GE 1; Tr. 32-36, 90-91, 110-111, 127-128) \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to underemployment, unemployment, \nfraudulent charges of about $500 to his bank account in 2017, COVID 19, his former \nwife\u2019s unemployment, relocation costs and child related expenses including child support \n($560 per month), divorce, emergency medical expenses of about $500 in 2023 to treat \ninjuries from an auto accident, and to his immaturity. In 2018, Applicant and his then \npregnant wife relocated to a lower cost area near her mother, and he had to accept a \nlower paying job. He said he participated in a Debt Consolidation Program for about a \nyear and then focused on paying off the largest debt first (SOR \u00b6 1.g) which he now \nbelieves to be a mistake. He said everything has changed since his daughter was born in \nOctober 2019. He wants to pay his debts and be more financially responsible. He has \nresearched debt resolution online but has not sought or received financial counseling. (Tr. \n17-19, 30-53, 100-104; GE 1 at 45-51, GE 2 at 5-7) \nApplicant said he worked with a debt consolidation company (DCC) in about 2019 \nand that he made payments to the DCC for about a year. After the hearing he submitted \na contract with the DCC dated May 9, 2022. (AE D) The contract enrolled $26,698 in debt \nincluding debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g, and required 48 monthly deposits of $453 \nbeginning May 13, 2022.

Credit reports from May 2022 \nand January 2023 show the auto loan account opened or assigned in May 2018, charged \noff, and with a balance of $3,678. (GE 1 at 49-50, GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at 2) \nApplicant testified he opened the loan account in 2018 and voluntarily surrendered \nthe vehicle in late 2019 or early 2020 because he could not afford the required payments. \nThe debt is the deficiency balance owed after the vehicle was sold at auction. The original \nloan was for about $40,000. He has been aware of this debt since mid-2021. After \nreceiving a letter from the creditor in about August 2023, he contacted the creditor to \ndiscuss a possible settlement. He could not afford the requested monthly payments \n($300-$400) or the settlement offer ($2,500). He has not contacted the creditor since. (Tr. \n55\u201361, 105-107; GE 2) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit card charged off for $5,286. Credit reports from May 2022 and \nJanuary 2023 show the individual account was opened or assigned in June 2011, charged \noff, and with a balance of $3,439. (GE 1 at 46-47, GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at 2) Applicant\u2019s \ncontract with a DCC showed this account with a balance of $3,439, as of May 9, 2022. \n(AE D at 15) \nApplicant testified he used this credit card to pay medical expenses when he broke \nhis collarbone in 2016. He set up minimum payments with a debit card to keep the card \ncurrent but changed debit cards because of account discrepancies including fraud. He \nfailed to update the delinquent account with the new debit card number. He was notified \nthe account was delinquent in about 2020 but has taken no action to resolve or pay this \ndebt because of insufficient income. (Tr. 66-67) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit account charged off for $2,865. Credit reports from May 2022 \nand January 2023 show this individual account was opened or assigned in November \n2012, charged off, and with a balance of $2,865.

(AE D at 15) \nApplicant disclosed this debt in his SCA dated April 21, 2022, and discussed it with \na government investigator in June 2022. (GE 1 at 45-46, GE 2 at 5) He stated the financial \nissue began in about December 2019 and that he could not keep up with the payments \nbecause of Covid-19 and his newborn child. He testified he did not recall this debt but has \nconsidered obtaining a personal loan to pay off his delinquent debts. He researched how \nto contact creditors but has not contacted this creditor or taken other action to resolve this \ndebt. (Tr. 67-70) This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.f: credit cards charged off for $2,539, $2,475, and $2,212, \nrespectively. Credit reports from May 2022 and January 2023 show these individual \naccounts were with the same creditor, assigned or opened in January 2017, June 2016, \nand May 2019, charged off, and with balances of $2,539, $2,475, and $2,025, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrespectively.

He failed to update the account with the new debit card number and was \nnotified the accounts were delinquent. He has not paid the debts because he was \noverwhelmed by marital problems and parenthood, and he was not in a good place \nmentally.

(AE D at 15) \nApplicant testified he obtained financing of about $22,661 to buy a motorcycle in \n2018 and that he voluntarily surrendered the motorcycle later that year because he could \nnot afford the payments. He said he made a few payments on the delinquent loan in late \n2019 or early 2020. In about October 2023 the creditor contacted him with what he \nbelieved to be an offer to settle the debt for $1,500, which he paid. He then learned the \npayment was not a full settlement but that it had reduced the delinquent balance. He felt \ndiscouraged and misled and has not contacted the creditor since. After the hearing he \nsubmitted proof of a $1,500 payment on September 6, 2023, and a loan balance of \n$7,933, as of April 23, 2024. (Tr. 61- 66, 107-113; AE A-C, AE E; GE 1 at 47-48) This \ndebt is unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances improved after he started working his current \njob in April 2022. He was initially paid about $30 per hour and now earns $34.68 per hour \nor about $72,000 a year in gross income. He enjoyed a surplus of about $1,600 per month \nfor six months in 2023 and had about $4,000 in savings in July 2023. Injuries sustained \nin an August 2023 motorcycle accident rendered him unable to work for about 11 weeks. \nHe received short term disability payments of about 70% of his pay for 11 weeks and \nsince returning to work he has been living paycheck to paycheck. His net income is about \n$4,000 per month and his fixed monthly expenses are about $3,200 including rent, child \nsupport, and a vehicle loan payment ($790). In February 2024, he obtained a $28,400 \nvehicle loan to finance purchase of a 2018 model year truck after his 2007 model year \nauto suffered mechanical failure. He has less than $10 in the bank and a 401K retirement \naccount worth about $26,000. He is considering obtaining a loan from his 401K account \nto resolve at least one SOR debt. (GE 4; Tr. 35-44, 74-84, 95-100, 126-127; AE E) \nDuring the hearing Applicant was informed of the importance of providing \ndocumentary evidence of debt payments, contact with creditors, efforts to address or \nresolve his delinquent debts, and his financial circumstances.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence, including Applicant\u2019s admissions establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems dating back to at least 2019.

Applicant\u2019s \npayments reduced this debt from $10,403 in May 2022, to $7,933, as of April 23, 2024. \nHis most recent payment, $1,500 in September 2023, was made almost four months after \nhe responded to the SOR.

Sep. 21, \n2009). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered the entire record, including \nApplicant\u2019s work history and that his financial problems were caused, in part, by \ncircumstances beyond his control. I also considered his limited resources, and that he \nhas made some efforts to resolve his largest delinquent debt. However, there is \ninsufficient evidence that Applicant has acted responsibly given his circumstances or that \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nhe has developed a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant \nconduct.

After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith a longer track record of financial responsibility, he may be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In about 2003, he earned a technical \ncertificate. (Tr. 18-20; Answer; GE 1) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant has 16 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $60,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p). These delinquencies consist \nof a residential lease (SOR \u00b6 1.a), automobile loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.o), loans to \npurchase furniture (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.p), credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.k), \nmedical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.n), and telecommunications debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and \n1.m). He admitted the SOR allegations except for the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, \n1.m, 1.n, and 1.p. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. He provided additional \ncomments with respect to each allegation. The SOR allegations are established through \nhis admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. (SOR; Answer; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant first became delinquent on the SOR debts in about 2018. The debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.m, and 1.p are duplicate accounts of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.l that I therefore \nfind in his favor. Despite his failure to provide corroborating documentation, I believe his \ntestimony that he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n sometime in 2023, although the record is \nunclear whether he paid it before or after he received the SOR. I also find in his favor \nwith respect to this debt. He has not resolved or made payments on the other accounts \nlisted in the SOR. (Tr. 38-67, 69-75; Answer; GE 2, 4) \nIn 2021, Applicant attempted to make a payment arrangement with the creditor of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he could not afford the amounts the creditor required. In June \n2023, after he received the SOR and realized his security clearance eligibility was in \njeopardy, he hired a credit-repair company (CRC) that specializes in having debts \nremoved from its client\u2019s credit reports by disputing them regardless of whether they are \nvalid debts. The CRC does not help him pay his outstanding debts, and it does not offer \nfinancial counseling. It estimated that it would take between 8 and 12 months to let \nApplicant know which accounts remained on his credit report. He plans to try to make a \npayment arrangement on the SOR debts in the coming months, after the CRC finalizes \nits list of debts that would continue to be reported on his credit report. (Tr. 38-67, 69-75; \nAnswer; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant has experienced significant hardships over the past several years that \nhave contributed to his inability to pay his financial delinquencies. In July 2017, his \nfianc\u00e9e suddenly and unexpectedly passed away. In addition to the mental anguish he \nsuffered, he could no longer afford many of his financial obligations as they had shared \ntheir income and expenses. After she passed way, his father came back into his life \nafter years of estrangement. However, in November 2017, his father passed away as \nwell. Applicant had emergency surgery in March 2018 to remove an internal abscess \nthat became infected. He was in the hospital for a month while he recovered.

He is paid bi-weekly and takes home about \n$3,000 per month. He has two bank accounts with a combined balance of about $140. \nHe also has a retirement account with about $40,000 in it. He has followed a written \nbudget for about two years and has about $300 in surplus funds at the end of each \nmonth, but he uses part of that surplus for other expenses such as gas and vehicle \nmaintenance. (Tr. 20-23) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had 16 delinquent debts totaling about $60,000.

However, the remainder of his \ndelinquent accounts are more problematic. \nWhile acknowledging that Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose almost entirely due to \nextremely tragic circumstances that were beyond his control, he has not resolved the \nvast majority of his SOR debts. Except for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, he only attempted to \nresolve the debts after he received the SOR and realized his security clearance \neligibility was in jeopardy. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only \nafter having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). \nAfter he received the SOR, the only resolution action Applicant took was to hire a \nCRC to dispute his debts regardless of whether they are owed. This CRC has not \nprovided him with financial counseling. Given these circumstances, he has not acted \nresponsibly or in good faith to resolve his delinquencies. His financial issues are \nongoing, and he has not established a track record of financial responsibility. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I am highly sympathetic to \nthe tragic events that have befallen Applicant over the last several years. However, I \nmust still follow the Directive to determine security clearance eligibility, and I must \nresolve any doubts in favor of national security. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She then worked for a state \ngovernment contractor from February 2021 to May 2021 when she was laid off. Applicant \nis currently unemployed. (Item 2) \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant has significant outstanding financial \nobligations; to include (1) a total of $41,916 in delinquent Federal income taxes for tax \nyears (TY) 2017-2019, (SOR \u00b6 1.f.); (2) $13,272 in outstanding State A taxes for TY 2016\u00ad\n2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.g.); and (3) various consumer debts delinquent in the approximate amount \nof $24,898. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.s.) The record evidence further demonstrates that Applicant \nhas failed to timely file her Federal income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2022. She \nfailed to timely file State A income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2022. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.e.) Applicant provided documentation, with the exception of TY 2022, that both the \nFederal and State A tax returns have since been filed. Applicant filed for bankruptcy \nprotection in 1998, 2008, and 2013. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c.) (Items 1- 8) \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She \nalso clarified that based on the advice from her tax representative, she did not earn \nsufficient income to require the filing of Federal and state income tax returns for TY 2022. \nHer admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 1) \nThe October 2022 SCA showed that Applicant had disclosed multiple delinquent \naccounts and listed that she had not filed Federal or state income tax returns for TY 2020 \n\u201c[d]ue to Covid, layoffs and not working. Just recently after exhausting all [of her] savings, \n[she] has not been able to pay due to hardship.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by an authorized DOD investigator in December 2022. \nShe attributed her unpaid taxes and account delinquencies to her May 2021 loss of \nemployment. She was paying delinquent taxes until June 2022, when she depleted the \nremaining funds in her savings account. She is willing but financially unable to satisfy her \ncreditors. Her current financial situation is dire unless steady employment can be secured. \n(Item 3) \nIn September 2023, Applicant responded to the Government\u2019s FORM. She stated \nthat she faced a series of life challenges, including a divorce, periods of homelessness, \nand the responsibility of being a single mom to two children (although only one child was \nlisted on the SCA). Caring for her parents with medical issues also contributed to her \nfinancial struggles. She admitted to making financial mistakes in life, but her primary focus \nwas always on providing for her family. Applicant does not believe her financial challenges \nclassify her as a risk to U.S. security.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 \n19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis or provides evidence or actions to resolve \nthe issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. She has \nfailed to provide supporting documentation to demonstrate her good-faith efforts to \nremedy her significant amount of outstanding taxes, as well as her other delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR. She has a long history of financial indebtedness, even \nduring periods of employment, and she has a pattern of filing her Federal and state tax \nreturns late. These procrastinations cannot be wholly attributed to her May 2021 loss of \nemployment, which is a circumstance beyond her control. Since she depleted her savings \naccount in June of 2022, she has not been able to make any payments to any creditors \nbecause she does not have the financial means to do so.

The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used numerous illegal substances from about March of 2015 until his \nlast usage in November of 2021. He has also purchased and distributed \nEcstasy/MDMA, and purchased Ketamine. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nWhile Applicant has disassociated himself from his fellow partying drug users, \nmoved to another county away from their influence, and has eschewed any future drug \ninvolvement, it is too soon to say that this admitted \u201chigh functioning addict\u201d has \u201ckicked \nhis habit.\u201d This should not dissuade Applicant from applying for a security clearance in \nthe future, after a significant period of continued abstinence. For the present, however, \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is highly respected at his \nworkplace and in his community. (AppXs F and G.) However, overall, at present the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance.

On \nJune 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines E and H. The CAS acted under Executive Order \n(Exec.

He received the FORM on September 29, 2023, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 11, 2024.  \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana in November 2020 (SOR \u00b6 2.a), \nthat he falsified his SCA by failing to disclose his marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he \nfailed to disclose his marijuana use during an interview with a security investigator in May \n2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b but denied intentional falsification. His explanation of his conduct alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b amounts to a denial. His admission of the marijuana use alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 2.a is incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 30-year-old security administrator employed by a defense contractor \nsince February 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 2011 \nto February 2015 and received an honorable discharge. He served in the inactive ready \nreserve from February 2015 to June 2018 and received an honorable discharge. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2020. He is unmarried and has no children. His SCA \nreflects that he received a security clearance in September 2012, while he was on active \nduty in the Marine Corps, and again in November 2020, while employed by a federal \ncontractor. \nApplicant consumed two marijuana edibles in November 2020 after his roommate \nsuggested using them as a sleep aid. He was unhappy with his job and was considering \nlooking for non-federal employment. He submitted applications for several jobs, but his \napplications were not accepted because of COVID. He was stressed about finding \nsuitable employment and unable to sleep. He had tried melatonin without success. His \nroommate suggested marijuana edibles and gave him two of them that were purchased \nfrom a legal dispensary. They did not work, and he experienced a panic attack after taking \nthe second edible. \nApplicant changed his mind about leaving federal employment when he was \noffered a job by his current employer. He submitted an SCA in March 2021, but he did \nnot disclose his marijuana use. (FORM Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2021. The summary of \nthe May 2021 interview reflects that he was questioned about his college education, his \nprevious employments, his military service, and an unusual financial transaction. \nHowever, the summary does not reflect that he was asked about any drug involvement. \n(FORM Item 4 at 10-11) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed again in November 2022.

(FORM Item 4 at 14) \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2023, Applicant stated that the \nsummary of the November 2022 was incorrect and that he self-reported his marijuana \nuse in November 2021, not September 2022. (FORM Item 4 at 4) He also submitted a \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of \nhis national security eligibility. (FORM Item 4 at 9) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use \nwhen he submitted his March 2021 SCA. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that he deliberately failed to \ndisclose it during his interview with a security investigator in May 2021. The following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAt the time Applicant submitted his SCA, he had served on active duty in the \nMarine Corps for almost four years. He was a college graduate. He went through the \nsecurity-clearance process in 2012 and 2020, and he knew that marijuana use violated \nfederal law and was an impediment to obtaining a security clearance. His experience with \nthe marijuana edibles was unpleasant, resulting in a panic attack of sufficient severity to \ncause him to stop using them. I conclude that the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a is established, \nand the evidence is sufficient to establish the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a). \nThe summary of the May 2021 interview reflects discussion of several topics \nunrelated to marijuana use. It does not reflect that Applicant was asked about marijuana \nuse or that he volunteered any information about it. I conclude that the allegation in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b is not established. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. The summary of the November 2022 interview \nreflects that Applicant volunteered the information about his marijuana use and told the \ninvestigator that he had previously self-reported it to his security office. However, his \naction was not prompt. His response to DOHA interrogatories reflects that he self-\nreported his marijuana use in November 2021, about eight months after submitting his \nSCA. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification was infrequent but it was \nrecent. It did not occur under unique circumstances. It was not \u201cminor.\u201d Falsification of a \nsecurity clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was more than three years \nago, it was infrequent, and it has not recurred. It occurred when Applicant was dealing \nwith stress and sleep deprivation, which have been resolved and are not likely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is established. Applicant acknowledged his marijuana use, has not \nused it again, and submitted the statement of intent in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines E and H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his marijuana use, but \nhe has not mitigated the concerns raised by his lack of candor during the adjudication of \nhis application for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 1.) The action \nwas taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on June 8, 2023.

He attributes \nhis financial difficulties to his divorce, and to a theft from his former business. \n(Response at page 2.) \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n1.a.

In his Response, however, he avers, \u201cI have settled that debt,\u201d \nreferring to his Enclosure A. This enclosure shows a \u201cwithdrawal\u201d of $2,567 from \nApplicant\u2019s bank, accredited to Creditor A. There is no evidence, however, that this \nadmitted past-due debt has been settled or completely satisfied. This allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \n1.b. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of $2,630. He \navers that this \u201cmedical bill is for my ex-wife\u2019s son.\u201d On Applicant\u2019s October 2022 credit \nreport, this \u201cMEDICAL . . .ACCOUNT INFORMATION IS DISPUTED\u201d by Applicant. \n(Item 8 at page 2.) \nFurthermore, this alleged past-due debt does not appear on \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent February and June 2023 credit reports. (Items9 and 10.) This \nallegation is found for Applicant. \n1.c Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor C in the amount of $11,784. He \nhas settled this past-due auto loan for $1,767, with monthly instalments of $294. This is \nevidenced by a \u201cconfirmation\u201d of Applicant\u2019s \u201csettlement arrangement\u201d by Creditor C. \n(Item 1 at page 8.) I find that Applicant is making a good-faith effort to address this \ndisputed debt. \n1.d. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor D in the amount of $43,007. \nThis mortgage loan was transferred to Applicant\u2019s former spouse upon the dissolution of \ntheir marriage. Applicant\u2019s current balance is \u201c0.00,\u201d as evidenced by documentation \nfrom Creditor D. (Item 1 at pages 9~13.)

This \ndebt has been paid through Applicant having his wages garnished, as evidenced by \ndocumentation showing the garnishment has been completed. (Item 1 at pages 14~20.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n1.f. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of $10,149. He \noffers documentation showing this debt has been reduced to $8,949, and avers he is \nmaking monthly payments of $372 towards this debt, but has offered nothing further in \nsupport of his averment. (Response, Enclosure B.) Without evidence of said payments, \nthis allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.g. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of $7,968. He \noffers documentation showing this debt has been reduced to $3,455, and avers he is \nmaking monthly payments of $215 towards this debt, but has offered nothing further in \nsupport of his averment. (Response, Enclosure C.) Without evidence of said payments, \nthis allegation is found against Applicant. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n2.a. Applicant denies that he used the prescription medication Adderall, not \nprescribed to him, from about April 2019 to about April 2021. In his Answer, Applicant \navers that he only \u201cused the medication one time in April 2019.\u201d This is contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s May 2022 SF-86, wherein he admits to the dates alleged and avers \u201con \nseparate occasions my wife gave me some of her pain killers and muscle relaxers for a \nrecurring back pain.\u201d (SF-86 at page 47.) \n2.b. Applicant denies that he used Cocaine with varying frequency, from about \nMay 2018 to about April 2019, while in possession of a security clearance. In his \nAnswer, Applicant avers that he only \u201cused [it] on the occasion of one weekend.\u201d This is \ncontrary to Applicant\u2019s May 2022 SF-86, wherein he admits to the dates alleged and \navers \u201cthere were 2~3 occasions . . . [he recalls] using cocaine between 2018 and \n2019.\u201d (SF-86 at pages 45~46.) \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \n(The Government does not allege that Applicant\u2019s above, alleged drug \ninvolvement constitutes criminal conduct.) The allegations will be addressed \nchronologically. \n3.c. Applicant admits that about February 2009, he accepted Non-Judicial \nPunishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for Drunken or \nReckless Operation of a Vehicle. He was reduced in rank from E-4 to E-2, restricted for \n45 days, given 45 days extra duty, and forfeitures. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3.b. Applicant admits that about November of 2014, he pled guilty to Driving \nUnder the Influence (DIU). He was sentenced to pay court costs, fined, and placed on \nprobation for one year. \n3.a. Applicant admits that in about July 2020, he was charged with DUI. The case \nwas dismissed. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAlthough Applicant can attribute much of his financial difficulties to one of his \ndivorces, he still has past-due debts totaling over $13,000 that he has yet to address. \nFinancial Considerations is found against Applicant. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nAppellant used cocaine in 2018~2019, while possessing a security clearance. He \nalso used Adderall without a prescription. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (f) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. His cocaine involvement occurred while Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance. He has submitted no such statement eschewing future drug \ninvolvement. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets forth the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of a DIU in 2014. He also received an alcohol related \nArticle 15 in 2009. The evidence establishes the above two disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides two conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns \nraised in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time passed, ten years, since Applicant\u2019s 2014 DUI. Criminal Conduct \nis found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on August 4, 2023, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 17, 2024.

Applicant did not submit anything additional. Email \ncorrespondence on this matter is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) III. \nSOR Amendment \nDepartment Counsel amended the SOR by withdrawing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 8-10) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since February 2023. He has worked for federal contractors since \n2012. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since about 2014. He \nattended college for a period without earning a degree, and he has a certificate of \ncompletion of a vocational school. He is married, with four children. He and his wife also \ncare for two children who live with them. (Tr. at 13-16, 19, 51, 55-56; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1; AE R) \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties, dating back at least nine years. His \nwife became ill in about 2015, which left her disabled and unable to work a full-time job. \nThere were also medical costs that were not paid by insurance. Applicant and his wife \nbecame primary caregivers for her elderly mother in 2015. They moved into his mother-\nin-law\u2019s home and spent about $3,000 to $4,000 to upgrade the home to make it \naccessible. His mother-in-law made his wife co-owner of the property. The home \npassed to his wife on her mother\u2019s death in 2020. They incurred additional expenses \nrelated to a lien on his mother-in-law\u2019s property. (Tr. at 19-24, 46-48; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5; AE J, L, O, X, DD) \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s friend and four children were homeless. He and his wife let the \nfamily stay with them in 2021. His wife and her friend had a falling out, and the friend \nmoved out, but one child stayed. Sometime later, another child was in a dangerous \nsituation and moved back to live with Applicant and his wife. They incurred legal \nexpenses to be named guardians of the child who moved back. They have taken on \nfinancial responsibility for both children without the benefit of support from their mother \nor the state. (Tr. at 24-28, 51, 58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE Y, Z, DD) \nThe amended SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $21,320. Applicant \nadmitted that he owed all the debts, except he denied that he still owed the $2,334 \ncharged-off credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. That creditor issued an IRS Form \n1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in 2022 cancelling $2,334 in debt.

Applicant stopped making payments \nafter the vehicle broke down in about 2015. He sent a letter to the creditor asking about \na settlement, but the creditor is asking too much at this time. He stated that he plans to \naddress this debt after the smaller debts are resolved. (Tr. at 30-32, 38-40; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d allege delinquent debts of $3,367 and $2,204 to a collection \ncompany collecting two accounts for the same bank. Applicant stopped paying these \ndebts in about 2016. He sent letters to the bank asking about settling the debts, but he \ncannot afford the settlements. He plans to address these debts after the smaller debts \nare resolved. (Tr. at 33, 40-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE C, E, W) \nApplicant was an authorized user on his wife\u2019s account that became delinquent \nwith a balance of $800. (Withdrawn SOR \u00b6 1.f) He stated that he was paying the debt \nand provided documentation of a $15 payment in March 2024. However, that payment \nwent towards a different non-alleged debt. (Tr. at 34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n2-5; AE V) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a delinquent debt of $792 to a collection company on behalf of \na creditor. Applicant stopped paying this debt in about 2018. He made $67 payments in \nJune and July 2023, and $18 payments in February and March 2024. He is on an $18 \nper month payment plan. The collection company reported in March 2024 that the \nbalance had been reduced to $658. (Tr. at 34-35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2-5; \nAE U) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent debt of $724 to a collection company on behalf of \na bank. Applicant stopped paying this debt in about 2019. He made a $10 payment in \nMarch 2024. He is on a $10 per month payment plan. (Tr. at 35, 43; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5; AE HH) \nApplicant stated that his finances have improved. His pay almost doubled to \nabout $85,000 in March 2023. He and his wife live a frugal lifestyle and are dedicated to \nthe children. He has received financial counseling. He stated that it is important to pay \nhis debts, because he lives in a small house with three bedrooms. He needs to build or \nbuy a bigger house, and he needs a better credit score to do so. He asserted that he \nwill increase his payments after the attorneys\u2019 fees for the guardianship and his security \nclearance proceedings are paid. (Tr. at 27-29, 35-36, 49-51; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; AE A, N, EE-GG) \nApplicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong \nmoral character. The authors praised him for his dedication, ethics, trustworthiness, \ndedication, expertise, professionalism, mentorship, work ethic, reliability, and integrity. \nThey recommend him for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the Applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \nApplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties, dating back at least nine years. His \nwife became ill in about 2015, which left her disabled and unable to work a full-time job. \nHe and his wife became primary caregivers to her elderly mother in 2015. They moved \ninto his mother-in-law\u2019s home and spent about $3,000 to $4,000 to upgrade the home to \nmake it accessible.

They have taken on \nfinancial responsibility for the children without the benefit of support from the children\u2019s \nmother or the state. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were largely beyond his control, \nestablishing the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). For full mitigation credit, he must prove that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant stated that his finances have improved. His pay almost doubled to \nabout $85,000 in about March 2023. He had attorneys\u2019 fees that needed to be paid, but \nhe has made minimal payments toward his debts. He made $67 payments in June and \nJuly 2023, and $18 payments in February and March 2024 to one creditor; $10 to \nanother creditor: and $15 toward a non-alleged debt. Those payments total less than \n$200. As of the date of the hearing, he had payments plans of $18, $10, and $15 for \nthose debts, but it is unknown if he continued with those plans. Intentions to resolve \nfinancial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment \nor other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, \n2013). \nIf Applicant had a longer period of meeting his payment plans, this decision \nmight have gone for him. As is, he does not have a track record of debt repayment. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will \nbe resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The $2,334 charged-off credit card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c was resolved through an IRS Form 1099-C, not through any action \nby Applicant. None of the above mitigating conditions are applicable to the other debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant admits that she has eight past-due debts to Creditor E \ntotaling about $2,115. She has submitted nothing further in this regard. These allegations \nare found against Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApart from her satisfying Creditor C, Applicant still has outstanding debts totaling \nabout $45,000 that she has yet to address. Applicant has thus failed to meet her burden \nto mitigate the financial concerns set out in the SOR. Financial Considerations is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant's answer to the SOR, he admitted each SOR allegation with a brief statement. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 27-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense contractor since June 2020. He graduated from high school in 2014. (Item 4 at 7, 9, 10.) He held a security clearance while serving active duty in the U.S. Navy. (Item 6 at 7.) He served in the Navy from April 2015 to October 2019, when he was administratively separated with an other than honorable discharge (OTH). (Item 4 at 13-14.) Guideline F SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: two delinquent accounts in the amounts of $8,432 and $14,621 with his financial institution. The former, a credit card account, which had been placed for collection and the latter, a loan, which had been charged off. Applicant admitted the debts. He stated he took out the loan in 2017 to cover his living expenses because he had been ordered out of base housing because of the misconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a and the Navy did not pay him a housing allowance.

He \nwas given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on March 4, 2024, and did \nnot respond. The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2024. \nThe SOR (FORM Item 1) and the Answer are the pleadings in the case. FORM \nItem 4 the SCA, FORM Item 5 (Interrogatories dated March 3, 2023), FORM Item 6 \n(Interrogatories dated June 1, 2023), FORM Item 7 (Criminal Investigation Services \nReport of Investigation dated October 4, 2019), FORM Item 8 (FBI Identification Record \ndated August 11, 2022), FORM Item 9 (Full data credit report dated August 11, 2022), \nFORM Item 10 (Equifax credit report dated June 7, 2023), and FORM Item 11 (Equifax \ncredit report dated February 12, 2024) are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant's answer to the SOR, he admitted each SOR allegation with a brief \nstatement. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 27-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense contractor \nsince June 2020. He graduated from high school in 2014. (Item 4 at 7, 9, 10.) He held a \nsecurity clearance while serving active duty in the U.S. Navy. (Item 6 at 7.) He served in \nthe Navy from April 2015 to October 2019, when he was administratively separated with \nan other than honorable discharge (OTH). (Item 4 at 13-14.) \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b: two delinquent accounts in the amounts of $8,432 and \n$14,621 with his financial institution. The former, a credit card account, which had \nbeen placed for collection and the latter, a loan, which had been charged off. Applicant \nadmitted the debts. He stated he took out the loan in 2017 to cover his living expenses \nbecause he had been ordered out of base housing because of the misconduct alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a and the Navy did not pay him a housing allowance. He told the \ninvestigator that he incurred debts but \u201cwas unable to specifically explain how he \naccumulated\u201d these debts\u201d. He was eventually awarded back pay in 2019 and he used it \nto resolve his late rental payments. (Item 6 at 6.) He told the security clearance \ninvestigator he had lost track of the credit card debt but that he had made payments on \nthe debt but could not recall them. (Item 6 at 7.) In response to Government \ninterrogatories, he admitted the debts; marked he was making payments on both debts; \nand marked that he was not providing documentation \u201cshowing payment status or proof \nof payments.\u201d (Item 5 at 4-5.) For another debt listed in the Government interrogatories \nhe did provide documentation that the debt was paid. (Item 5 at 5.)

He told the investigator that \nhe was going employ a debt consolidation service and, in his Answer, stated he was \nworking with a financial advisor for a credit repair company. He was asked about \ndocumentation of payments in the Government interrogatories. He provided no details or \ndocuments about his current financial situation and how he would be able to resolve these \ntwo debts. He has been employed since 2020. (Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 4-5; Item 6.) \nGuideline J and D \nApplicant in October 2017 was arrested and charged with a violation of \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 120 (Sexual Assault). Pursuant to \na pretrial agreement, he pled guilty to the reduced charge of violating UCMJ Article \n128 (Assault Consummated by Battery) and received a sentence of 15 days \nconfinement and reduction of rank to E4. He was administratively separated and \nreceived an other than honorable discharge from the Navy. Applicant admitted in his \nAnswer to the allegations and cited to the fact he had no further incidents as mitigation. \nHe admitted to placing his hand on the victim\u2019s breast while they were in bed, which he \nbelieved to be consensual and then moving his hand to her groin area while they were \nlaying together in bed. They had previously had \u201cphysical interactions in the past but [had] \nnot had sex. (Item 6 at 4.) The victim pushed him away. The victim described him pushing \nher pants down and trying to penetrate her vaginally from behind. Applicant was charged \nunder Article 120 (Sexual Assault) and as part of a pretrial agreement, Applicant pled \nguilty to the lesser offense of Article 128 (Assault consummated by Battery). He was \nsentenced to 15 days of confinement and reduction in rank to E-4 and agreed to waive \nhis administrative separation board. He was discharged from the Navy with an OTH. He \nstated he now seeks verbal consent before engaging in physical contact with his \ngirlfriends and he no longer has a relationship with the victim. (Item 6 at 5-6.) \nGuideline E \nThe information set forth in subparagraphs 1.a.-1.b and subparagraph 2.a., \nabove are cross alleged. Applicant admitted both allegations and the facts discussed \nabove are applicable. (Answer; Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 6-7.) \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM, so he did not provide any new evidence \nto be considered in mitigation. He also provided no character evidence for consideration \nunder the whole-person concept. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accrued delinquent consumer debts during a period of unemployment \nafter leaving military service. The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He has been consistently employed since June 2020. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge to \ndeliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems but there is no evidence he has acted in a reasonable and \nresponsible manner in addressing these two debts, which casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. In order to receive full credit under \nMitigating Condition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d He did not establish that he has \nmade a good-faith effort to pay or resolve these debts. \nApplicant attributes his debts to when his housing allowance was not paid by the \nNavy. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For full consideration under AG \u00b6 \n20(b) an applicant must establish that they acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe has not done so. He completed his SCA in August 2022. The most recent record \nevidence (February 2024 credit report) shows both debts remained past due. The reason \nhe lost his on base housing was due to his misconduct, which is not circumstances \nbeyond his control, but the Navy\u2019s failure to pay his housing allowance was a \ncircumstance beyond his control. He did not provide sufficient evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant pled guilty to assault consummated by battery. The above disqualifying \ncondition applies. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is serious but sufficient \ntime has elapsed since the 2017 criminal behavior that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has obtained a job \nin 2020 despite his discharge characterization and has been continuously employed with \nthe same company. He has established record of responsible behavior and compliance \nwith rules, regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are \nsufficient to mitigate those concerns. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe sexual assault charge, alleged as part of SOR \u00b6 2.b under Guideline J \n(criminal conduct) is cross-alleged under Guideline D as sexual conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.a). \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 13: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n14: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant acknowledges he had a past relationship with the victim but his actions \non the night in question occurred without him confirming the victim\u2019s consent. He pled \nguilty to assault consummated by a battery. He now seeks verbal consent before \nengaging in physical contact with his girlfriends. He no longer has a relationship with the \nvictim, and does not engage in circumstances which could make him to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress, AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) are applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a and \n4.b. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nSOR \u00b6 4.a and 4.b cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s debts and criminal behavior (alleged \nunder Guidelines F and J, as noted above) as a personal conduct security concern. \nApplicant has resolved some debts not alleged but has neglected these consumer debts \nand there is no evidence of fraud, deceptive, or illegal practices that would make these \ndebts a personal conduct security concern. Therefore SOR \u00b6 4.a is found for Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct reflects questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. AG \u00b6 16(c) is therefore applicable. \nThe following mitigating conditions under are considered under AG \u00b6 17: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nI found for Applicant under Guideline J in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Using the same rationale \ndiscussed above for criminal conduct, Applicant\u2019s positive conduct since leaving the \nNavy; acknowledgement that he must have verbal consent; that he no longer has contact \nwith the victim; as well as his employment success, establish his past criminal behavior \nis unlikely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), \n17(d), and 17(e) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, J, D, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, J, D, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline D:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 12, 2023, and requested a hearing.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of four exhibits (GEs 1-4). Applicant relied on one exhibit and one witness \n(himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 8, 2023. \nBesides its two exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of facts \ncontained in five attachments related to the country of Iraq and five attachments related \nto the country of Jordan.

Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 10, 2004). Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or government \nreports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006). For good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with respect to the \nabove-named background reports addressing the geopolitical situations in Iraq and \nJordan. \nAdministrative notice was extended, without objection, to the documents \nthemselves, consistent with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did \nnot foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information \ncontained in the reports addressing the current status of Iraq and Jordan. Additional \nadministrative notice was taken (without objections) of Background Note, Iraq, U.S. \nDept. of State (Feb. 2008); the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency \n(Feb. 2018), Iraq and U.S. Policy, Congressional Research Service (May 2022) and \nU.S. Relations with Iraq, U.S. Dept. of State (June 2022).

For good cause shown, \nApplicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was \nafforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant documented his \nprofessional engineering licenses, performance evaluations, and credit health \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as AEs B-D. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly has (a) a spouse who is a citizen of Iraq \nand (b) parents and siblings who are citizens of Iraq and residents of Jordan.

(id.) The 2021 elections were scheduled because of the widespread protests that \nbegan in October 2019 and led to the resignation of former prime minister Adil Abd al-\nMahdi in December 2019. Parliament, in turn, confirmed Prime Minister Mustafa al-\nKadhimi in May 2020. \nIn preparation for the 2021 national parliamentary elections, Iraq adopted a new \nelectoral law based on individual candidacy and local districts. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Iraq; supra; 2022 Human Rights Report, supra. The 2021 election \nlaw was designed to create new political opportunities for independents and members \nand protest movement that brought down the government formed after the 2018 \nelection. See Iraq and U.S. Policy, Congressional Research Service (May 2022). \nFollowing the adoption of the election law, the council of Representatives members \nnominated and confirmed Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani as the prime minister, along with \n21 of 23 of his cabinet members. See Iraq 2022 Human Rights Report, supra. Whether \nthe election results and formation talks will reduce the formal influence of Iran-aligned \ngroups who seek to revise or rescind Iraq\u2019s invitation to U.S. military advisors to remain \nin Iraq is unclear. \nFor historical perspective, in 2003, a U.S.-led coalition invaded Iraq and \nsucceeded in removing Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from military and \npolitical power. See the World Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. \n2018); Background Note, Iraq, at 3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008). After two years of \noperations under a provisional authority, Iraq\u2019s new government assumed office in \nMarch 2006 (with the approval of the U.S. government), following free elections. (id) \nSince March 2006, the government of Iraq has been comprised of a broad \ncoalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the \nWorld Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8. While elections \nhave been held and concluded, none of the key constituent groups have been able to \nform a government, adopt an oil law, establish and maintain effective security \nthroughout the provinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile \npolitical environment in Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that \ncontinue to underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence. See Iraq 2022 \nHuman Rights Report, supra, at 2-3. \nPost-COVID-19 protests intensified in May 2021, with demonstrators insisting \nthat the government identify and prosecute suspects in a series of assassinations and \nkidnappings since 2020 of protest lesdars, activists, and a prominent security \nresearcher. See Iraq and U.S. Policy, supra. Whatever government is able to survive \nthe competing Iraqi political blocks will continue to test the will of .continued U.S. \nsecurity cooperation and other bilateral ties against the security risks posed by Iraq\u2019s \ncited persistence of patronage politics, corruption, oil dependence, and armed non-state \nactors.

As a result \nof the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq\u2019s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered, \nThe rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand \nsince 2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity. \nProposed oil revenue-sharing legislation among the three war-hardened ethno-\nsectarian divisions (Shia, Sunni, and Kurds) still awaits passage after four years of \nstalled negotiations, and at the moment, there are no good estimates of when such \nlegislation will be approved and implemented. See Annual Threat Assessment of the \nU.S. Intelligence Community, Office of the Director of National Intelligence (February \n2023). For the foreseeable future, the national government can be expected to continue \nto seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law to strengthen and \nencourage the development of this important sector. \nPast budget laws passed by Iraq\u2019s national parliament requiring the KRG to \ncontribute certain export earnings in the country\u2019s overall exports (a law that would \nseem to validate the KRG\u2019s ownership claims to Kirkuk oil) have never led federal \nauthorities to export Kirkuk-produced oil. In so doing, Iraq\u2019s federal authorities have \nseverely limited Iraq\u2019s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking \nthe oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq\u2019s federal government \ncan have major positive ramifications for not only Iraq and its oil exports, but for the \nUnited States and other Western interests as well. \nTerrorism and human rights issues \nDespite recent developments in its security enforcement efforts, Iraq remains a \nvery dangerous, volatile, and unpredictable country. The U.S. State Department \ncontinues to strongly warn U.S. citizens against traveling to Iraq. See Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Iraq, supra, at 2-5; Iraq Travel Advisory, U.S. Department of \nState (January 2023) The State Department assessed Iraq as being a critical-threat \nlocation for crime directed at or affecting official U.S. interests. See Country Reports on \nTerrorism 2021, U.S. Dept. of State of State (Feb. 2023). After a year of stalemate and \nheightened intra-Shia violence following the elections of October 2021, Shia militias can \nbe expected to continue to pose a credible threat to U.S. forces in Iraq and the region. \nSee id. \nAttacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include \nsites and facilities where foreign tourists frequently visit: hotels, restaurants, police \nstations, check points, foreign diplomatic missions, international organizations, and \nother locations with expatriate personnel. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, \nsupra; Travel Advisory-Iraq, supra. The U.S. Embassy\u2019s ability to provide consular \nservices to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is extremely limited under the security \nenvironment that still exists in Iraq. \nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing \nWaiver Program.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

Key to the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns \nare Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings (an older brother and younger sister) who are \ncitizens of Iraq and residents of Jordan. Terrorist attacks and human rights abuses have \nlong plagued Iraq and to a lesser extent, Jordan. Because both Iraq and Jordan present \nsome heightened security risks for applicants who have family with property interests in \nthe country (Iraq and Jordan in Applicant\u2019s case), Applicant is exposed to civilian and \nmilitary authorities in the country who might use improper and/or illegal means to obtain \nclassified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control through his parents and \nsiblings. \nTo be sure, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents and siblings are relatively \nfrequent (weekly with his parents and monthly with his siblings), and reflect close \nfamilial ties of longstanding. And, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person with \nimmediate family members in a foreign country has ties of affection for, or obligation to, \nhis or her immediate family members, and this presumption covers even in-laws.

Feb. 20, 2002) \nHeightened risk assessments require consideration of an applicant\u2019s interests \nand family ties in the country or countries of interest. The risk of coercion, persuasion, \nor duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government; \nthe government ignores the rule of law (including widely accepted civil liberties); a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government; the government is \nengaged in a counterinsurgency; terrorists cause a substantial amount of death or \nproperty damage; or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations \nagainst the United States. With respect to Iraq, and Jordan to a lesser extent, the \ncountries are certainly not free from risks of potential hostage taking. Iraq and Jordan, \nthough, do maintain strong bilateral relations with the United States and recognize \ndemocratic principles of governance. \nTaken together, the personal and financial relationships Applicant has with Iraq \nand Jordan, and the situations that exist in these countries, place a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with any family menders \nwith Iraqi citizenship and residences in Jordan who hold property subject to inheritance \nrights favorable to Applicant and his siblings do not pose irreconcilable security risks. \nSuch risks that cannot be reconciled or otherwise mitigated could potentially place him \nin a position of having to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to \nassist a relative living in or visiting Iraq or Jordan, or to take actions to protect his \nproperty interests (directly or indirectly) in Iraq and Jordan. \nFurther, while Applicant\u2019s residual inheritance interest in his parents\u2019 Iraqi and \nJordanian property interests are inchoate ones with the potential for change, his \n12 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ninheritance potential alone is enough to present some risks of irreconcilable conflicts of \ninterest.

June 2005) While not dispositive, inheritance rights in the property of \nfamily members in foreign countries of security interest do present factors to be \nconsidered along with other factors when assessing an applicant\u2019s comparative wealth \nin the United States and other countries of interest. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s inheritance rights in Iraq and Jordan, the Government, in \npart, urges security concerns over risks that Applicant and his family interests in Iraq \nand Jordan might be subject to seizure or revision by civilian or military authorities in \nIraq, or even Jordan. His inheritance interest, accordingly, poses some risk of revision \nor confiscation by the government of Iraq, enough to warrant some application of two of \nthe disqualifying conditions of the foreign influence guideline DC \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, \nregardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion\u201d and 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information or technology.\u201d \nPotentially applicable, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation is \u00b6 7(f), \u201dsubstantial business, \nfinancial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in any foreign-operated business \nthat could subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s reported inheritance rights in his parents\u2019 \nIraqi property interests has potential value to him. His interest, though, is inchoate and \nunlikely to pass to him in the near future. Neither Applicant nor his parents or siblings \nhave any direct or indirect control over any potential reversion exercise by the Iraqi \ngovernment. \nTrue, none of Applicant\u2019s parents or siblings come with any history of being \nsubjected to any coercion or pressure. These historical antecedents limit the risk of any \npotential conflict situation. And, while the absence of any past coercive measures taken \nby Iraqi or Jordanian authorities does not completely absolve Applicant from any \ncoercive risks in the future given Iraq\u2019s checkered history of terrorism and human rights \nabuses, the risks of any coercive measures being taken against his parents and siblings \nshould be considered minimal in making an overall risk assessment. \nThis is not to discount the significance of the nature of the foreign government \n(Iraq and Jordan in this case), Iraq\u2019s intelligence-gathering capabilities and human rights \nabuses, Jordan\u2019s human rights violations, and the favorable government relations that \nexist between both countries and the United States. These are among the most \nimportant considerations to be considered when assessing risks associated with an \napplicant\u2019s family ties and property interests in that country.

Given the substantial family ties and financial interests \nthat Applicant and his wife enjoy in the United States, any potential conflicts that \nApplicant could potentially face with his parents and siblings in Iraq and Jordan, \nrespectively, promise to be minor and reconcilable with Applicant\u2019s long demonstrated \nloyalty to the United States and considerable and longstanding family interests in this \ncountry. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s relatively modest values placed on his inchoate Iraqi and \nJordanian inheritance rights when placed in juxtaposition with his U.S. financial \ninterests, MC \u00b6 8(f), \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual,\u201d is also available to \nApplicant. Nothing developed in the administrative record is indicative of any realistic \nconflict of interest arising as the result of Applicant\u2019s inheritance rights in Iraq and \nJordan that could place him in a position of having to choose between the prioritizing of \nhis own financial interests over the security interests of the United States. \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his parents and siblings holding Iraqi \ncitizenship with Jordanian residence status and their financial interests in these \ncountries (thoroughly covered in the testimony and closings, although not specifically \nalleged in the SOR) are less significant than his family connections and financial \ninterests in the United States. Applicant\u2019s substantial connections financial interests in \nthe United States when considered together with his foreign connections and \ninheritance rights are sufficient to overcome the Government\u2019s foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n              \n \n \n \n  \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s foreign influence risks to ascertain \nwhether they are fully compatible with eligibility requirements for holding a security \nclearance takes account of the. citizenship and residence status of Applicant\u2019s parents \nand siblings who are citizens of Iraq and residents of Jordan.

He married in \n2003, and has one child, a 14-year-old son. (Items 2 and 3) \nApplicant, a full-time systems engineer, has worked for the same federal defense \ncontractor since July 2005. His most recent grant of a secret security clearance occurred \nfollowing a favorable adjudication of his September 2015 SCA. He disclosed that he was \ngranted a secret security clearance for the first time in about 2004. (Id.) \nApplicant completed his current SCA in September 2021, where he disclosed \nseven unresolved delinquent debts estimated at about $126,000.

During his September 2022 background \ninvestigation, he discussed the details concerning each debt. (Item 3) He stated that, prior \nto 2019, he was in good financial standing with his creditors. His main debts were a home \nmortgage, student loans, and credit card debts. Before 2019, he successfully contributed \nto his 401(k)-retirement plan, and set aside funds for emergencies. (Item 3 at 2) He stated \nhis financial problems resulted from his son\u2019s competitive swim and ski team activities. \nHis expenses tripled in 2019 due to his support of these activities.

(See Items 2 through 5) \nApplicant traveled internationally five times between February 2016 and December \n2019. Specifically, he toured Canada twice, in February 2016 (1-5 days); and again, in \nJanuary 2017 (6-10 days).

(Item 2 at 30-37; and Item 3). He used \ncredit cards and personal loans to finance travel-related expenses and his son\u2019s \ncompetitive sports activities. (Item 3) \nApplicant listed his gross monthly income at $10,000, with a net income of $4,000. \nHe listed his spouse\u2019s gross monthly income at $5,000, with a net income of $2,000; for \na combined net monthly income of $6,000. His assets, other than family income, exceed \n$1.8 million in value: home ($1.2 million), three cars ($16,000), checking and savings \naccounts ($5,300), and 401(k) retirement plan ($600,000). His monthly expenses total \n$7,890 and included: a mortgage ($3,500); his son\u2019s competitive activity fees ($1,200), \nand entertainment ($300). His monthly debts total $1,415, and include: student loans \n($370), credit cards ($1,000), and fitness club membership ($45). (Item 3) \nThe evidence for all allegations in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h: Applicant admitted the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough SOR 1.h. All eight debts are individual accounts that were charged off between \nApril and June 2022. (Items 4 and 5) The two oldest debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f, were \nopened in 1998 with the same creditor. Both accounts were 150 days past due before the \ncreditor charged them off. The narrative indicates that a past dispute with the creditor was \nresolved. (Id.) Applicant did not dispute any of the SOR debt and did not raise this as an \nissue in his Answer. (See Answer to SOR) All eight debts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: Applicant admitted this debt. However, there is no independent \nevidence or information in the record to support the allegation that, in May 2009, \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished for $3,749.15, by a previous employer. (See Items 2 \nthrough 5) This allegation is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: Applicant also admitted this debt. However, there is no independent \nevidence or information in the record to support the allegation that, in January 2008, \nApplicant received a five-day suspension without pay for violating a company policy \nregarding the personal use of a company credit card.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, two credit reports, and statements made during his \nbackground investigation establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6  20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are applicable in this case. Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are recent, ongoing, and unresolved, despite the fact that he has been \ngainfully employed with the same defense contractor for over 19 years, and reported a \nnet worth that exceeded $1.8 million, including $600,000 or more in a 401(k)-retirement \naccount. There is insufficient evidence to establish that conditions creating his financial \nsituation were beyond his control; or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nor that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. Though he stated he planned to get \ncounseling, and to contact creditors to establish a repayment plan, he did not state nor \ndid he provide documentary evidence to show he took these actions. His financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant has not met his mitigation burden. Financial considerations security concerns \nremain in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is described in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process \nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther than Applicant\u2019s admission, there is no evidence in the record to support the \npersonal conduct allegation in the SOR. The disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(e) has not \nbeen established in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nGatha LaFaye \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",
