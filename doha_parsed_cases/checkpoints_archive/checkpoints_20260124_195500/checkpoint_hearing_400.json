Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a material specialist with his current employer since February 2017. A 1993 high school graduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and completed additional credits but no other degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance. Applicant was married the first time in 2007, and divorced in 2015. He remarried in 2016. Although he did not list having any children in his e-QIP, Applicant has two children born in 1994 and 1996. Financial Considerations1 In his e-QIP, Applicant essentially attributed his financial difficulties to a period of unemployment in 2014 that left him with insufficient funds to pay his rent. He also noted that his ex-wife was to repay one particular credit card in 2013 because he was not working. He denied having any other delinquencies, accounts in collection, accounts 1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated February 13, 2017); Item 5",

De Angelis, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 13, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On March 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG) for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n03/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 13, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated March \n19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on May 3, 2018, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on May 16, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response was due on \nJune 15, 2018. Applicant timely submitted several documents which were marked and \nadmitted as Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE D, without objection. The case was \noriginally assigned to another Administrative Judge on July 26, 2018, but because of \nillness issues, it was reassigned to me on February 27, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.t.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a material specialist with his current employer since February 2017. A 1993 high school \ngraduate, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in 2014, and completed additional \ncredits but no other degree. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never \nbeen granted a security clearance. Applicant was married the first time in 2007, and \ndivorced in 2015. He remarried in 2016. Although he did not list having any children in his \ne-QIP, Applicant has two children born in 1994 and 1996. \n \nFinancial Considerations1 \n \nIn his e-QIP, Applicant essentially attributed his financial difficulties to a period of \nunemployment in 2014 that left him with insufficient funds to pay his rent. He also noted \nthat his ex-wife was to repay one particular credit card in 2013 because he was not \nworking. He denied having any other delinquencies, accounts in collection, accounts \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below can be found in \nthe following exhibits: Item 4 (e-QIP, dated February 13, 2017); Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, \nand Equifax Credit Report, dated April 19, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 12, 2017); \nItem 7 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 30, 2018); Item 8 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 25, \n2017); Item 3 (Answer to the SOR, dated March 19, 2018). \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \ncharged off, or repossessions,2 a position that was untrue.3 During his enhanced subject \ninterview conducted by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) in August 2017, Applicant initially denied having any other accounts sent to \ncollections. Upon being confronted with certain contrary facts, he generally acknowledged \nthe delinquent status of most of the accounts. He noted that he had experienced several \nperiods of unemployment: October 2012 until February 2013, because he quit his job to \nrelocate to his spouse\u2019s new job location, and he was supported by his spouse and his \n401(k); May 2013 until July 2013, for the same reasons; November 2013 until December \n2013, while he was attending school, studying, and looking for a new job, and supported \nby his spouse; July 2014 until October 2014, after he was fired, and was supported by his \nspouse; and November 2016 until February 2017, after he quit and got remarried.  \n \nDuring that OPM interview, Applicant stated that it was his plan to rectify his \nfinancial problems over the next five years with increased salaries until the accounts were \npaid off.4 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant added that the debt was accrued because \nhe had \u201cendured some hardship\u201d and his new plan was to have all of his creditors \u201cpaid \noff within [two] years, but no longer than [five] years.\u201d5 In an undated Answer to the FORM, \nApplicant modified his plan by stating that he will have all of his small creditors paid off in \ntwo years, and the remaining creditors will be paid off in five years.6  \nThe SOR identified 20 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or repossessed, all generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s April 2017, December \n2017, or April 2018 credit reports. Applicant acknowledged that he had made no effort to \nresolve nearly all the accounts, largely because of a lack of income, but reiterated his \nintention to rectify them. Those debts, totaling approximately $21,206, all of which were \nplaced for collection, are described below: \n                                                          \n2 Item 4, supra note 1, at 37-41. \n \n3 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal \nBoard. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to \nevaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular \nprovision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis \nunder Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also \nISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. \nSept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged \ndelinquent accounts, as well as his lack of candor on his e-QIP, will be considered only for the five purposes \nlisted above. \n4 Item 8, supra note 1. It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay \noff delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner \nand otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n5 Item 5, supra note 1.  \n6 AE B (Answer to the FORM, undated). \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) is a joint (with his ex-wife) credit-card account for $6,061 that was \ncharged off, and by virtue of their divorce decree, both Applicant and his ex-wife are each \nresponsible for one-half of the balance; (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) is an automobile loan with an unpaid \nbalance of $4,404 that was voluntarily repossessed; (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) is an apartment lease \nwith an unpaid balance of $3,402 from which Applicant was evicted; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d., 1.h., \n1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.q.) are medical accounts with unpaid balances of $1,966; $465; \n$368; $231; $207; $206; and $195; (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. through 1.g.) are credit-card accounts \nwith unpaid balances of $623; $604; and $491, that were charged off; (SOR \u00b6 1.i.) is a \ncellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $424 that was charged off; and \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j.) is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid balance of $372. None of \nthose accounts have been resolved. \nIn addition, there are several accounts for which there is some evidence of possible \nresolution efforts made by Applicant:  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m.) is a cable internet or television account with an unpaid balance of \n$216 for which Applicant submitted one document acknowledging an authorization to the \ncollection agent to debit $108.08 on June 20, 2018 \u2013 three months after the SOR was \nissued.7 There is also a handwritten entry by an unidentified individual indicating that \nanother debit might be scheduled for June 27, 2018, but there is no documentation (bank \naccount or credit card register or statement, or creditor-issued receipt) to indicate that \none payment, much less two payments, had actually been made. The account has not \nbeen resolved. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p., 1.r., 1.s., and 1.t.) are medical accounts with the same \ncollection agent with unpaid balances of $353; $222; $199; and $197, totaling $971. In \nhis Answer to the FORM, Applicant contended that he had paid off each of those accounts \n\u201cas of May 30, 2018,\u201d8 and he attached a letter from the collection agent acknowledging \nhis authorization for them to initiate weekly $100 electronic payments from his account \ncommencing on March 21, 2018, and continuing until May 30, 2018,9 totaling $1,100. The \nauthorization does not identify the creditor account numbers to be addressed. Applicant \nfailed to submit any documentation, including account registers, creditor receipts, etc., to \nsupport his contentions that the payments had been made. In the absence of some \ndocumentation to support his reported efforts, the accounts have not been resolved.  \nIn response to comments made by Department Counsel regarding evidence of \npossible irresponsible spending by Applicant when he purchased a new automobile \n(actually a used 2009 luxury vehicle) in February 2018, for $12,941, Applicant stated that \nmost of the funds came from his insurance after his earlier vehicle was totally lost \nfollowing an accident in March 2016.10  \n                                                          \n7 AE C (Letter, dated June 14, 2018). \n \n8 AE B, supra note 6, at 1. \n \n9 Item 3 (Letter, dated March 21, 2018), attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 1. \n \n10 AE B, supra note 6, at 1; AE A (Statement, dated February 12, 2018); Also see AE A (Customer \nPayment History Recap Sheet, dated February 14, 2018). \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nIn addition to the SOR-related accounts, there is an educational loan for $7,268 \nwith an unpaid balance of $5,941 that was placed for collection in February 2018.11 For \nsome reason, not explained by Applicant, he submitted two scheduled payments of \n$131.18 each to a collection agent for an unidentified creditor or account to take place in \nJuly 2018.12 In the absence of some commentary connecting the payments to some \naccount, the significance of the document is minimal. \nApplicant failed to indicate his current monthly net pay, monthly expenses, debt \npayments, or if he has any monthly remainder that might be available for discretionary \nspending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. There is little evidence that since his SOR was issued in March 2018, \nApplicant has made any significant efforts to contact the vast majority of his creditors, \nenter into repayment plans with creditors, or make payments to creditors to resolve most \nof his delinquent or charged-off accounts, even to the smaller creditors to which he owes \n$195, $206, or $207. Other than his general statements about his future intentions, \nApplicant offered no evidence to indicate that his financial situation has improved, or that \nit is now under control.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d13 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d14   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n                                                          \n11 Item 7, supra note 1, at 1. \n \n12 AE D (Scheduled Payments, dated July 5, 2018). \n \n13 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n14 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d15 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.16  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d17  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d18 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n15 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n16 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n17 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n18 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe SOR identified 20 delinquent accounts that had been placed for collection, \ncharged off, or repossessed, totaling $21,206. Nearly all of those delinquent accounts \ncontinue to be unaddressed and unresolved, despite Applicant being fully employed since \nFebruary 2017, and expecting salary increases. Applicant claimed that when he was \nunemployed in 2014, he was unable to make his required monthly payments, but it \nappears that he was simply content to remain unemployed for periods of time sufficient \nfor him to continue his education and draw unemployment benefits. Applicant\u2019s failure to \neven address the minor delinquent debts until after the SOR was issued seems to \nconstitute an unwillingness to satisfy his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) have been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;19 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;20 and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions \napply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial difficulties \nmake it difficult to conclude that it occurred \u201cso long ago\u201d or \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it \nis \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to several periods of \nunemployment, and because he had endured some hardship, not otherwise described. \nIn addition, he was divorced in 2015. He had insufficient funds to maintain his financial \n                                                          \n19 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n20 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nresponsibilities. There is no documentation to reflect that Applicant obtained financial \ncounseling from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice; disputed his delinquent accounts with the credit reporting agencies or the \ncreditors themselves; contacted his creditors to set up repayment plans; or indicated that \npayments had been made to his creditors before the SOR was issued. Those few actions \nthat Applicant did make all commenced after the SOR was issued.21  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.22 In this instance, to date, there are authorized weekly \n$100 payments to an identified collection agent, to commence two weeks after the SOR \nwas issued; one dispute filed that was associated with an unspecified account in May \n2018; an authorized payment to an identified creditor in June 2018; and two scheduled \npayments to an unidentified creditor in July 2018. Before the SOR was issued, Applicant \nsimply ignored his creditors. There is no evidence that any other corrective actions have \nbeen taken by Applicant. There is no evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s finances are \nunder control. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed sustained action, are insufficient.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n                                                          \n21 See ISCR Case No. 12-01335 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). \n \n22 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.23  \n  \nThere is very little evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 44-year-\nold employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a material specialist with \nhis current employer since February 2017. He has professed an intent to rectify his \ndelinquent debts within five years. \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant exhibited a lack of candor when he completed his e-QIP and denied having any \nfinancial issues other than an eviction for unpaid rent and a credit card he claimed his ex-\nwife was supposed to pay. He actually had 20 delinquent accounts that had been placed \nfor collection, charged off, or repossessed, totaling $21,206. Nearly all of those delinquent \naccounts continue to be unaddressed and unresolved, despite Applicant being fully \nemployed since February 2017. Applicant has made minimal documented efforts to \nresolve his delinquent debts despite promising to do so. Applicant has not obtained \nfinancial counseling. There is no evidence of a budget, and he offered no evidence to \nindicate that his financial situation has improved, or that it is now under control. To the \ncontrary, a new non-SOR delinquent debt, an education loan with an unpaid balance of \n$5,941, was recently added to Applicant\u2019s portfolio of collections. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:24 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \n                                                          \n23 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n24 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, seemingly avoiding most, if not all, of the debts in his name. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.t.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Financial considerations and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      \n  \nHistory of the Case \n \n \nOn October 4, 2016, Applicant completed and signed his SCA. (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On April 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \n12/14/2018\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. \n \nOn April 27, 2018, Applicant provided his first response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) On June 1, 2018, the SOR was amended adding and \nclarifying allegations under the financial considerations guideline and adding an allegation \nunder the personal conduct guideline. (HE 2) On June 11, 2018, Applicant provided his \nresponse to the amended SOR. (HE 3) On June 11, 2018, Department Counsel was \nready to proceed. On July 30, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On August 15, 2018, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting \nthe hearing for September 6, 2018, using video teleconference. (HE 1) The hearing was \nheld as scheduled.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered four exhibits; there were no objections to the \ndocuments; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 10-15, 19-21; Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1-4) Applicant did not offer any exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 16) On September 12, \n2018, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, \n1.g, and 1.h.1 He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in \nweapons installation since October 2016. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2003, he received a General \nEducational Development (GED) diploma. (Tr. 6) He is currently seeking an associate\u2019s \ndegree in firearms technology. (Tr. 6-7) He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. (Tr. 7) \nHis Navy specialty was aviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was \npetty officer second class (E-5). (Tr. 8) He received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving \nthe Navy. These circumstances adversely affected his finances. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges \nthe following financial issues: \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges he failed to pay his \nfederal income taxes as required for tax year 2013.  SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant failed \nto timely file his state income tax return for tax year 2011.  \n \n                                            \n1 As part of this SOR response, Applicant provided a copy of a federal tax lien filed against his \nfather to establish that it was not Applicant\u2019s tax lien. (Tr. 17-18) No adverse inference is made because of \nthis tax lien. \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nApplicant filed his federal income tax returns for each of these tax years as follows: \n2009 filed on January 27, 2011 (Tr. 22-23, 27-28; SOR response); 2011 filed in \nSeptember 2018; 2013 timely filed in April 2014 (Tr. 48; GE 2); and 2014 filed on July 21, \n2017 (Tr. 33).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s March 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2013 indicates in \nFebruary 2016 he had additional taxes assessed of $5,007. (Tr. 34; GE 2) He explained \nthat he failed to include a withdrawal from his Thrift Savings Program account on his \nincome tax return resulting in additional taxes for \u201cunreported income.\u201d (Tr. 33; GE 2) His \nfederal income tax refund for tax year 2015 ($1,271) and 2016 ($1,593) were used to \naddress his delinquent taxes for tax year 2013. (Tr. 34; SOR response) The IRS \napparently waived some fees and charges because his 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax \nyear 2013 shows a zero pay off amount. (GE 2) A February 27, 2017 IRS letter also \nindicates his tax debt for tax year 2013 has a zero balance. (GE 2) His federal income tax \ndebt for tax year 2013 is resolved. \n \nApplicant was deployed as part of his Navy duties for most of 2010 and the first \nfew months of 2011. (Tr. 24, 26-27, 29; SOR response) He was waiting for the state to \nprovide a copy of his W-2 so he could file his state tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 25, \n30, 45) He was unable to get a W-2 from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service \n(DFAS). (Tr. 46) Applicant\u2019s state tax return has not been filed as of the date of his \nhearing. (Tr. 25, 45-46) \n \nApplicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2010, \n2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (SOR response; GE 2) He received a refund for all of \nthese tax years. (SOR response; GE 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt owed to a credit union for \n$22,983. In 2012, Applicant borrowed funds to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 35) The vehicle \nwas not repossessed. (Tr. 38) He stopped making payments for a time, and then in \nSeptember 2017, he resumed making $200 monthly payments. (Tr. 35, 37) The account \nis in current status. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a charged-off debt for $7,245. From May 2017 to April 2018, \nApplicant paid the creditor $200 monthly, and then in April 2018, the creditor offered to \nsettle the remaining debt for $3,000. (Tr. 40-41) In April 2018, Applicant paid $3,000 and \nsettled the debt. (Tr. 41) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he \ndid not timely file his federal or state tax returns in 2011. Applicant said at the time he \ncompleted his SCA, he had forgotten that he did not timely file his tax returns. (Tr. 42-43)  \n \nOn November 16, 2017, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \nasked him during his personal subject interview (PSI) whether he failed to file or pay his \nfederal or state taxes. (Tr. 47; GE 2) Applicant disclosed that he did not timely file his \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nfederal income taxes for tax year 2013, and he said he paid his tax debt for that year in \nFebruary 2017. (Tr. 47; GE 2) He did not disclose that at the time of his PSI he failed to \nfile his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011. At his hearing, he said he \ncould not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed \nhis federal income tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 47; GE 2) 2 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to disclose that he failed to timely file his \nfederal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011 to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). This \nallegation will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns as required . . . .\u201d Applicant admitted that he failed to timely \nfile his federal tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014 and state tax return for \n2011. His federal income taxes for tax year 2013 were not paid until 2017. He was late \npaying or making payment arrangements for two debts as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;3   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n                                            \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions apply; however, Applicant presented some mitigating \ninformation. He had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving \nthe Navy. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and caused or \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. He established a payment plan to address \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He was deployed for most of \n2010, which delayed filing his tax return for tax year 2009. His federal income tax debt for \ntax year 2013 is paid. Applicant is credited with mitigating the financial allegations in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f.   \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 and \n2014. He failed to file his state income tax return for tax year 2011. The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has observed: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his tax returns. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .\u201d \n   \nWhen Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he \nfailed to timely file his federal or state tax returns in the previous seven years. At his \nhearing, Applicant said at the time he completed his SCA, he had forgotten that he did \nnot timely file his tax returns. This explanation is not credible.  AG \u00b6 16(a) is established \nfor his failure to disclose accurate information about filing his tax returns on his SCA.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides five conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he \nfailed to timely file his federal or state tax returns for tax year 2011 and his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2014. During his OPM PSI, he disclosed that he did not timely file \nor pay his federal income tax return for tax year 2013; however, he brought proof to the \ninterview that his federal tax debt for tax year 2013 was paid. At his hearing, he said he \ndid not remember that he failed to timely file tax returns for tax year 2011, and he said he \ncould not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed \nhis federal income tax return for tax year 2011. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.   \n       \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in \nweapons installation since October 2016. He is currently seeking an associate\u2019s degree \nin firearms technology. He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. His Navy specialty was \naviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was petty officer second \nclass. He received an honorable discharge.   \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2011 \nand 2014, and his state tax return for 2011, raises unresolved financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. He may owe state income taxes for tax year 2011.4 When an issue of \ndelinquent taxes is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an \napplicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS or a state generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments.5 The primary problem here is that Applicant has repeatedly been late \nfiling his tax returns. He did not provide a good reasons for not timely filing his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2014 and his state income tax return for tax \nyear 2011.  \n \n Applicant\u2019s intentional falsification of his SCA was in a security context, and that \nfalsification raises a serious security concern. The protection of national security relies on \nApplicants to self-report conduct that jeopardizes security, even when that disclosure \nmight damage the Applicant\u2019s career. AG \u00b6 15 emphasizes, \u201cOf special interest is any \nfailure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.\u201d Applicant cannot be trusted to disclose \npotentially derogatory information. He did not establish his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n \n \n                                            \n4See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n \n5See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s \ncontrol adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \nwages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and \ninsufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

On \nAugust 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E, personal conduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 13, 2018, with a detailed, eight-page \nanswer, admitting in part, and denying in part, the SOR allegations. He provided \nexplanations and several attachments to his answer including: five character reference \nletters; evaluation and counseling records; a letter from the county district attorney \nrejecting charges against Applicant; copies of numerous awards, certificates, and letters \n\n \n2 \n \n \nof appreciation and commendation. These were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \n\u2013 F and admitted without objection.  \n \n \nApplicant also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on January 25, 2019. On February 7, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nMarch 1, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and his counsel submitted an additional \nperformance evaluation from his current employer, which was marked as AE G, and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. (Tr. 26) He \nmarried in 2010 and divorced in 2012. He remarried in 2014 and divorced in 2016. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy in 2014 and finished first in his class at culinary specialist \nschool. He also received an accelerated promotion to petty officer, and awards including \nthe Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, and a Surface Warfare Pin. \n(Tr. 29-30) He attached documents to his answer to the SOR including excellent \nperformance evaluations, letters of appreciation, and certificates of commendation for \nhis service in the Navy. (Tr. 16) He reports no children. Applicant has been employed as \na food runner at a hotel while awaiting the outcome of his application to be an Arabic \nspeaking linguist for a major federal contractor, which is contingent on obtaining his \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 24-25)  \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. (Answer). He admitted \nin part, and denied in part, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, because he \nadamantly denies that he committed domestic assault or battery against his wife, and \nshe later recanted her allegations. The county district attorney dropped all charges \nagainst Applicant and the restraining order was rescinded. (AE D, Tr. 38-39)  \n \n Applicant testified that he received a general discharge, under honorable \nconditions as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e due to two events that occurred within 30 days of \neach other. (Tr. 22-23) The first incident, at the end of June 2016, occurred due to a \nmiscommunication between Applicant and his senior chief. (Tr. 32) Applicant had \nsubmitted a request to take 4-5 days annual leave to go home to assist his sister after \nher back surgery. (Tr. 33) Applicant had approved leave papers in hand. A week before \nhe departed the ship to go on leave, Applicant learned that his sister\u2019s surgery was \npostponed and he needed to request an additional day of leave. He did so, and \nreceived verbal authorization to simply extend his leave from his petty officer first class \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s April 25, 2017 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) and the summaries of his personal subject interviews (PSI) in May \n2017.

(Tr. 34, 65) However, the first class failed to log this extension into the \nsystem.  \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he did not have sufficient time to submit a formal \nleave request in writing through his chain of command (COC) because several of his \nseniors were away on leave. (Tr. 47-48) Applicant accepts responsibility for this \nmistake, as he failed to follow up and ensure that the leave was formally recorded. (Tr. \n50, answer) When he returned from leave, he was charged with various Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ) violations as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant went to \nnonjudicial punishment (NJP) for these offenses and he was sentenced to 30 days \nrestriction and extra duty and demoted in rank by one grade. (Tr. 35) In a statement on \nbehalf of Applicant, submitted at his NJP, the first class corroborated that he verbally \nauthorized the extension of leave, but he was overwhelmed with work, and forgot to log \nit. (Tr. 64)   \n \nApplicant denied in part the allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d, which all \narose out of the second incident in July 2016. While he was serving his NJP sentence of \nrestriction to the ship, Applicant was enduring a very difficult time with his wife. One \nevening, he made repeated calls to his wife that went unanswered. (Tr. 35-36) His wife \nalso stopped responding to text messages. Applicant became extremely worried \nbecause of earlier text messages from her where she said she was having a very bad \nday. (Tr. 54) Previously she had a miscarriage while he was at sea. (Tr. 36) Applicant \nleft the ship without authorization, and he went to his nearby home to find his wife with \nan interloper. (Tr. 37-38) It was plain to see she was having an adulterous affair. \nApplicant was shocked and argued with his wife after the interloper departed. During the \nargument, she arose quickly from the couch, and he gently pushed her back with an \nopen hand, fearing that she was about to do something rash. (Tr. 38) She was not \ninjured. She called the police and he was arrested. (Tr. 38)  \n \nApplicant disclosed both of the afore mentioned incidents fully, as well as the \nresultant NJPs and General Discharge, in his April 2017 SCA. Following his arrest in \nJuly 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife became embarrassed and sorry for calling the police. (Tr. \n39) She convinced the prosecutors to dismiss all charges against Applicant, and she \nwithdrew the domestic violence restraining order alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d as frivolous. (AE \nD) He had a second NJP nonetheless, where he was sentenced to reduction in rank \nfrom E-4 (Petty Officer) to E-3 (Seaman), and 45 days restriction and extra duty. (Tr. 63) \nApplicant subsequently obtained an amicable divorce from his wife in December 2016. \n(Tr. 41)   \n        \n Applicant testified that he lost substantial Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \neducational and other benefits due to his General Discharge. (Tr. 74) He provided two \nexcellent performance evaluations for each year from 2014 to 2016. (AE B) He also \nprovided six favorable character reference letters from his supervisors and a colleague. \nOne was from Applicant\u2019s senior chief (E-8), who was the supervisor of the first class \nwho granted verbal authority to extend his leave. (AE A) They attest to Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, integrity, honesty and work ethic. He also provided several letters of \n\n \n4 \n \n \nappreciation and certificates of commendation for his military service. I found his \ntestimony was direct and candid. \n \n \n \n                                   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \n The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes. The following \nnormally will result in an unfavorable national security eligibility \ndetermination, security clearance action, or cancellation of further \nprocessing for national security eligibility . . .  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified information. This \nincludes but is not limited to, considerations of: \n \n   \n   \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations \n \n Applicant admits to wrongfully leaving his ship without authorization, while he \nwas still on restriction, on the night when he discovered his wife cheating. He also takes \nresponsibility for not confirming that his verbally authorized extension of leave was \nformally entered into the unit\u2019s computer diary and properly approved. He was led to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nbelieve it had been approved after a discussion with a supervisor. The Government \nprovided substantial evidence of his rule violations on these occasions and his general \ndischarge. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3), are implicated and the focus shifts to a \ndetermination of which, if any, of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns  \n            Include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he was under a great deal of stress related to his \nmarriage when he left his ship without authority. He relied to his detriment on a \ncolleague, a petty officer first class, to enter the verbal extension in the unit diary. He did \nnot follow through and confirm that the extension had been properly granted. He pled \nguilty and accepted his NJP punishment although he appears to have had a valid \ndefense. He has already been punished for both transgressions by the Navy. He \nreceived two NJP punishments including loss of a stripe, restriction, and extra duty. \nAdditionally, because he had two disciplinary incidents so close in time in the summer of \n2016, the Navy gave Applicant a General Discharge under honorable conditions. He \nlost substantial Post-911 GI Education Bill benefits and his chosen career as a result. I \nfind that his transgressions were committed almost three years ago. They occurred \nunder unique circumstances of his wife\u2019s infidelity and such misconduct is unlikely to \nrecur. He has divorced his wife, left the Navy, volunteered to become a linguist, and \ntaken other positive steps to alleviate stressors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17 (c) and (d) apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG, Appendix A, \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline.  \n \nApplicant disclosed his disciplinary problems in the Navy in his SCA and \nconcedes he made mistakes. He was already punished for those minor transgressions. \nHe wants to continue to serve DOD as an Arabic linguist for a contractor. His judgment \nno longer remains a security concern. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that his \npersonal relations are under control, and he will not repeat his previous misconduct. \nThe record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \npersonal conduct security concerns under Guideline E.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                                      FOR Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 2.e:                                       For Applicant  \n                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn March 2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security\nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated June 8, 2017.\n03/29/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 5, 2018, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to other judges on May 13, 2018 and July 13, 2018, respectively, and\nreassigned to me on January 9, 2019. The case was scheduled for hearing on February\n13, 2019. The Government\u2019s case consisted of five exhibits (GEs 1-5), which were\nadmitted without objection. Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 15 exhibits (AEs\nA-O), which were admitted without objection. The transcript was received on February 26,\n2019.  \nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documented responses from her\ncredit reporting agencies to her disputed accounts. For good cause shown, Applicant was\ngranted 30 days to supplement the record. (Tr. 80) Department Counsel was afforded five\ndays to respond.\nWithin the time permitted, Applicant provided eight separate documents that were\ncomprised of the following: excerpts from her 1099-Cs, proof of no collection accounts,\ndisputes and outcomes, comprehensive dispute history and outcomes, a personal\nstatement of Applicant, a student loan repayment plan, and additional letters of\nrecommendation. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as AEs P-W \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 14 delinquent debts\nexceeding $134,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding.\nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the allegations in the\nSOR with explanations. She admitted SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.n and denied the allegations\ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.a for stated reasons that she is in full compliance with her loan\nmodification agreement of 2014. For the remaining debts, she claimed extenuating\ncircumstances associated with periods of unemployment and difficult circumstances\nduring the lengthy economic downturn beginning with the 2008 market crash.  She further\nclaimed that her remaining listed debts no longer appear on her 2018 credit report. She\nclaimed that she has received financial counseling on the debts in issue. And, she\nclaimed that she is honored to be working for her current employer and the Army as a\ncontractor.\n.\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 39-year-old statistician for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance. Most of the allegations in the SOR were admitted by Applicant and are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. The remaining allegation is reserved for fact-\nfinding based on the developed evidence at hearing. Additional findings follow with\nrespect to Applicant\u2019s admitted allegations\n2\n\nBackground\nApplicant cohabits with her partner and has one child (age six months) from this\nrelationship. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 19) She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from a prestigious private\nuniversity in foreign affairs and a master\u2019s degree in economics from a respected state\nuniversity in her former state of residence in December 2005. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-I) She\nattended graduate classes in statistics from the same state university between January\n2014 and May 2016 but earned no degree or diploma. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-I) Since\n2017, she earned a graduate certificate from an accredited state university in her current\nstate of residence and is 12 hours short of earning a master\u2019s degree from the same\nuniversity. (AEs G-I) Applicant reported no military service. \nSince January 2018, Applicant has worked full time as a statistician for her current\nemployer while she completes her graduate education studies. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-H\nand U; Tr. 20) Between 2015 and 2017 she worked for a technical services company in\nher former state of residence as an analyst. (GE 1) Previously, she worked for other\nemployers in various technical capacities. (GEs 1-2 and AEs G-H and U) She held a\nsecurity clearance for a brief period in 2015 while she interned for the Army. (Tr. 21) For\nalmost several months (October 2012-January 2013), she was unemployed. (GEs 1-2)\nDuring this period of unemployment, she devoted her energies to the real estate business\nher parents started in her former state of residence and earned very little money (GE 1;\nTr. 21-24)  \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 2006 and the present, Applicant has operated a residential property\nbusiness with her mother. Between 2006 and 2008, she and her mother purchased 11\nresidential properties (single family homes) in her prior state of residence that ranged in\nprice from $69,000 to $180,000. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 24-26, 47-48) Applicant financed their\npurchases primarily with mortgages in her name individually, with some initial\ncontributions from her mother who sold her home to help with the initial financing. (GEs 2-\n5; Tr. 25-26, 66-68, 70) In 2018, Applicant and her mother purchased a 12   home in her\nth\nprior state of residence and financed their purchase with a $64,000 mortgage. (GE 5; Tr.\n47) Applicant and her mother purchased these properties with the primary goal in mind of\nraising money for their retirement. (Tr. 25-26) All told, Applicant generated loan proceeds\nfor her residences totaling more than $1 million based on her sole credit. (GEs 2-5; Tr.\n26-27, 45-46) \nApplicant has consistently borne full responsibility for the financing and\nmanagement of the 12 properties she purchased with her mother. (Tr. 26) Credit reports\nand Applicant\u2019s payment history confirm that all of the residences are currently rented,\nand she is current with all of her mortgages. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 27-28, 46, 67) However, these\nproperties have little equity, and some are underwater according to Applicant. (Tr. 53-54) \nBesides the first mortgages on the 12 properties Applicant financed, Applicant\nsecured a second mortgage on one of her properties in the amount of $45,000 in 2006.\n3\n\n(GEs 2-5; Tr. 26-27, 70-71) The loan became delinquent in 2013 while Applicant was\nunemployed. (Tr. 28-29) After talking with the lender about her situation in 2014, she was\nable to obtain a loan modification on this loan that called for monthly loan payments of\n$100. (AE A; Tr, 29-30) Applicant documented monthly payments since 2014 in\ncompliance with her modification agreement. (AE A; Tr. 29-30, 70)\nBetween 2008 and 2013, Applicant struggled with her finances and used her credit\ncards to finance her household necessities and business expenses associated with her\nrental properties. (GEs 2-5 and AEs G-H and U; Tr. 23, 71) Altogether, Applicant\naccumulated over $134,000 in delinquent credit card debt during this 2008-2013 time\nframe. (GEs 2-5) Three  of the listed delinquent SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d) were canceled by\nthe common creditor following Applicant\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to dispute inaccuracies\nand work out payment arrangements for the balances owed on all three delinquent\naccounts.  (AEs B-D; Tr. 31-33) \nIn December 2017, the creditor for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d issued 1099-C\ncancellation of debt notices for each of the debts that total approximately $21,000. (AEs\nB-D; Tr. 31-32) Applicant is in agreement that the debts covered by the cancellation of\ndebt notices for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d were in default at the time the cancellation notices\nwere issued and had not previously been addressed by her. Because of the cancellation\nof the debts by the creditor for SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, federal taxes became due on the\n$21,000 in imputed income from the debt cancellations. Excerpts from Applicant\u2019s 2017\nfederal tax return document Applicant\u2019s inclusion of the imputed $21,000 as income from\nthe canceled debts. (AE P) Applicant, accordingly, is credited with including her\ncancellation of debts covered in AE F as imputed income in her 2017 federal income tax\nreturn. Whether she ultimately owed any taxes for tax year 2017 after accounting for\ndeductions is unclear. (AEs B-D and P; Tr. 33) \nApplicant, however, has not been able to address any of the remaining credit card\ndebts that exceed $99,000 in the aggregate. (GEs 2-5; Tr.33-39) Applicant disputed these\ndebts on grounds of inaccuracy (without disputing the entire amounts of the reported\ndebts), and they have since been removed from her 2018 credit reports. (GEs 2-3 and 5\nand AEs G-H; Tr. 39, 68-69) None of the removed debts, though, reflect documented\ndisputed amounts, and Applicant did not provide any corroborative proof of her dispute\nletters to the credit reporting agencies, who never responded to her. (GEs 2-5 and AEs E-\nF; Tr.33-39, 72-79) Because Applicant has produced no evidence of her addressing any\nof these SOR debts, the removal of these remaining consumer debts from her credit\nreports cannot reasonably be attributed to payment or successful dispute initiatives, as\nopposed to other reasons like payment satisfaction or the age of the debts. (Tr. 73-78)\nCurrently, Applicant has no specific plans in place to address any of her remaining\ndelinquent debts covered in the SOR. (Tr. 68)\nFor lack of sufficient income sources of her own and the economic unfeasibility of\nraising rents on any of the 12 properties she owns, Applicant has not been able to make\nany headway with her listed SOR debts and remains at risk to revenue setbacks on her\nreal estate should she encounter loss of tenants or other unanticipated real estate\n4\n\nexpenditures in the future. (Tr. 82-83) She has been a full-time student throughout 2017\nand 2018, while reportedly holding down a full-time position since 2018, and has not been\nin a position to work out any payment plans with her remaining creditors or pursue any\nrealistic opportunities to consolidate her debts. (GE 4 and AEs G-H and U; Tr. 39-41) \nTo her credit, Applicant enrolled in a financial credit counseling course in February\n2019 and earned a certificate of counseling in February 2019. (AE L) At the time of her\ncounseling, Applicant did not request a debt repayment plan preparation from her\ncounselor, and none was prepared. (AE L) From her counseling sessions, she acquired\nlessons about the importance of budgeting and staying within budget. (AE L; Tr. 83)  But\nwithout a payment plan or plans in place, predictable assessments of her ability to mount\nserious repayment efforts in the foreseeable future cannot be made.\nApplicant currently grosses about $106,000 a year based on her 2017 federal tax\nreturn and nets about $4,400 a month from her current employer and maybe $1,000 a\nmonth from her real estate investments. (AE P; Tr. 39-41) She has a 401(k) retirement\nplan with about $20,000 in the account. (Tr. 42) Significantly, she expressed no plans at\nthis time to use any of her monthly discretionary income to address any of her SOR\ndebts. Her repayment plans at this time, though, are limited to paying off the roughly\n$155,000 in aggregate student loans she has, once she completes her graduate studies,\nby setting aside $1,500 a month to pay off the loans. (AE V) \nCharacter references \nApplicant is well-regarded by friends, former colleagues and tenants, and\nprofessors who have interfaced academically in her current graduate program. (AEs K\nand W) All credit Applicant with loyalty, a strong work ethic, honesty, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2\u00a9.\n5\n\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \n6\n\nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulated delinquent debt that\nshe has amassed over a five-year period (2008-2013) Altogether, Applicant accrued\nover $135,000 in delinquent debt, mostly from credit cards she used to finance her\nresidential properties and manage her home necessities. Most of her debts remain\nunresolved and outstanding.\nFinancial Concerns\n      Applicant\u2019s incurring of delinquent debts warrant the application of three of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d;\n19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt\ndelinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent debts is critical to an assessment\nof an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and\n7\n\nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a\nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR\nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited extenuating\ncircumstances (i.e., unemployment, the 2008 market crash, and her education\ncommitments) provide some mitigation credit for her failure to address her accrued\ndebts. Based on her cited circumstances, MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has some\napplication to Applicant\u2019s situation.  \nConsidering all of Applicant\u2019s  cited circumstances, the \u201cacting responsibly\u201d prong\nof  MC \u00b6 20(b) has only limited application and cannot excuse her past failures to\naddress her debts with evidence of payments and payment plans that reflect at least the\nbeginnings of a good track record of addressing her remaining consumer debts. Failure\nto make more good-fath efforts to address her remaining debts, precludes her from fully\navailing herself of the  benefits of MC \u00b6 20(b)  See ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 3-5\n(App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007)\n(citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). For similar reasons, MC \u00b6\n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a  good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is not available to her.\nTo be sure, all of Applicant\u2019s remaining SOR debts have since been removed\nfrom her credit reports. Historically, removal of delinquent debts from an applicant\u2019s\ncredit reports has never been enough to satisfy the good-faith requirements for\nfavorably resolving the applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. \u201cThat some debts have dropped off\nhis or [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR case\nNo. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016)(citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 2015) The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative\nfinancial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency or the\ndebt becoming collection-barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is\nlonger. See 15 U.S. \u00a7 1681c. And, in Applicant\u2019s case, she could not verify whether her\nremaining SOR debts were removed because of her dispute letter, or for some other\nreason. Removal of delinquent debts by themselves is not enough without other\nevidence of good-faith payment initiatives to favorably resolve raised debt issues.\nTo her credit, Applicant has made some progress with some of her debts. She is\nto be credited with keeping her real estate first mortgages in current status to date.\nCompliance with the terms of her modification agreement with creditor \u00b6 1.a and the\ncancellation of debts with SOR creditors \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d. and her ensuing inclusion of\nimputed income from these debt cancellations on her 2017 federal income tax return is\nworthy of credit to Applicant as well. In recognition of these combined efforts, she is\nentitled to partial application of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d of the financial\nguideline.  Only partial benefit of MC \u00b6 20(c)  \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving\nfinancial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a\nnon-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is\n8\n\nbeing resolved or is under control.\u201d For while the counseling was of meaningful benefit\nto her in improving her understanding of the importance of budgeting and managing her\nfinances generally, she has not been able to use the counseling to make further gains in\nresolving her remaining SOR debts.  \nFor lack of documented corroboration, other potentially applicable mitigating\nconditions are not available to Applicant. Application of MC  \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d requires documentation of\nApplicant\u2019s reasonable dispute requests to the credit reporting agencies, which\nApplicant could not provide. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, her failure to demonstrate more concerted steps in resolving her\nSOR debts, a necessary beginning to stabilizing her finances consistent with clearance\neligibility criteria, is concerning. Her accumulated delinquent debt accruals and\nheightened leveraging risks associated with her real estate portfolio place her at\nconsiderable disadvantage in her ongoing efforts to bring her finances under control.\nTaken together, her modest efforts to date in addressing her remaining SOR debts are\nnot enough at this time to warrant favorable findings and conclusions with respect to\nraised security concerns about her finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. She has shown\ninsufficient  progress to date in addressing her remaining SOR-listed debts, even with\nher increased discretionary income. While her payment efforts associated with her\nmortgage debts, and to a lesser extent, her honoring of her tax obligations in connection\nwith her three SOR debt cancellations, merit positive credit.\nApplicant\u2019s general contributions to the U.S. defense effort through her Army\nintern service and her statistical work are considerable and merit a good deal of respect\nand appreciation. The endorsements she has received from former colleagues, \ntenants, and her former graduate school professor reflect positive on her overall loyalty,\nhonesty, reliability and trustworthiness. And, most importantly, the achievements she\nhas established in her academic pursuits are impressive and will serve her well in her\nchosen field of statistics. But at this time, though, her positive credits are insufficient to\nsurmount historical trust and judgment issues associated with her debt accumulations\nand inability to manage her finances in a sound and prudent manner, consistent with\nmeeting the high standards set for approval of eligibility to hold a security clearance.\n9\n\nOverall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing her finances reflect too little\nevidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable\ndoubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information\nor occupy a sensitive position. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that her\nfinances are insufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements\nfor holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions are entered with respect to\nthe allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.n. Favorable conclusions are entered for SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.  Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and circumstances of\nthis case is inconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n   \n             Subparagraphs 1.e-1.n:\n                          Against Applicant\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                             For Applicant\n  \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 2, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DoD adjudicators could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 9, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September 12, 2018.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \nNovember 7, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 11, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted. Applicant testified on her own behalf. She submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthough E. The record was left open until January 25, 2019, and Applicant timely submitted \n02/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n \na packet of documents, which was marked as AE F, and was accepted into the record \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 23, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 44, is single. She obtained her associate\u2019s degree in 2000, and has \nbeen studying for her undergraduate degree for a few years. She is not attending classes \nat this time.  She is a senior administrative assistant for a defense contractor. Applicant \ncompleted her security clearance application (SCA) on March 28, 2016. (GE 1) She has \nheld a security clearance for about 12 years. (GE 1) She has worked for her current \nemployer since June 2018. She previously worked as a contractor since about 2005. (Tr. \n18) \n \nThe SOR alleges in 1.a through 1.n, 14 delinquent debts totaling about $34,000, \nwhich include four student loan accounts, charged-off consumer accounts, and medical \naccounts. (GE 2-4) Applicant admitted the SOR allegations and provided explanations for \neach one. (Answer) \n \nFINANCIAL \n \nApplicant acknowledged her financial hardship, and explained that she believed \nher finances were under control when she submitted her SCA, but explained that six knee \nsurgeries, other medical issues in 2016 through 2018, including a back surgery, 2016 \nsexual assaults in the workplace, and lost days of paid employment for months resulted \nin her current delinquent debt. (Tr. 8) Applicant missed many days of employment due to \nthe workplace issue and did not have a full paycheck for about one and a half years. \nApplicant was unemployed when she left the workplace after the late 2016-2017 sexual \nassaults and took a reduction in pay in her next job. (Tr. 22) She has spoken to a \nbankruptcy attorney, but she does want to pay her debts. (Tr. 9) She is in the process of \nconsolidating student loans. \n \nApplicant recounted how the sexual assaults at work led to depression and \nbecause she was afraid to report the incidents to her employer, she would take sick days \nmaybe one or two days a week. (Tr. 21-24) She spoke to an attorney and had a case \nworker and found the experience traumatic. Her emotional instability prevented her from \nconcentrating on her finances. This was the time period of 2016-2017 before she looked \nfor other employment. She knows that she has to take full responsibility for the financial \nsituation.  \n \nApplicant has paid the following SOR accounts: 1.j, an account in the amount of \n$581; 1.e, an account in the amount of $1,126; 1.f, a medical account in the amount of \n$245; 1.g, a medical account in the amount of $103; 1.h, a collection account in the \namount of $89; 1.i, a medical account in the amount of $181; and 1.n, a phone account \nin the amount of $202. (AE D-F) \n \nApplicant has the following SOR accounts in a payment plan: 1.a, a charged-off \naccount in the amount of $11,215 that has a term of 45 monthly payments of $250. (AE \n\n \n3 \n \nA) SOR 1.c, a charged-off account in the amount of $5,536 that has a term of 44 monthly \npayments of $125. (AE B) Applicant has made one or two payments on each account, \nbut did not provide documentation.  \n \nAs to the student loans at issue, SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.k, and 1.l, Applicant believes they \ntotal about $25,000. (Tr. 32) She started making payments on the loans but stopped in \n2016. (Tr.32)  Her student loans are not in deferment as she is not taking any classes. \nApplicant\u2019s intention was to return to class, but that did not occur.  She has been in contact \nwith the Department of Education and is in the process of arranging a payment plan that \nshe can afford. At the present time, she cannot afford the offered $700 a month. A \ncollection agency now is handling the loans and Applicant has been in touch with them \nand hoping for a $300 a month payment. This has not been approved. (Tr. 35)  \n \nApplicant admitted that she was indebted to a state university for a registered class \nthat she did not take and did not timely withdraw. (SOR 1.m) The amount owed is $1,797. \nShe explained that she has not attempted to resolve this account. She explained that \nthere were times when she was depressed that she did not open her mail. (Tr. 42) \n \nApplicant is working with her father to develop a budget and a strategy to handle \nher finances. She earns about $70,000 a year and lives with her two brothers. She has \nno new delinquent debt and no car loan.  Applicant has also spoken to the collection \nagent for the student loans concerning financial counseling. She has a monthly net \nremainder of about $365 after expenses. She has health insurance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \n\n \n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties are the result of many surgeries, medical problems, \nunemployment, and workplace sexual assaults in a particular period of time. She attended \nclasses and obtained school loans but has not been financially able to begin a \nconsolidation payment plan. These events were beyond her control and do not cast doubt \non her trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established.    \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  Applicant\u2019s unemployment, health issues, and \nmedical problems, and other issues were beyond her control, and she has acted \nresponsibly recently toward the majority of her smaller delinquent debts, with the \nexception of the student loans and state university account. She has only recently \nestablished two payment plans and made only one or two payments. She has not \nproduced sufficient information to show that she has been proactive in her actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not fully established. Applicant did not produce evidence \nof any financial counseling nor are there clear indications that her financial situation is \nunder control. She has not been able to consolidate her student loans and owes money \nto a state university. She has recently started payment plans but has only made one or \ntwo payments on each. She has made strides, but her financial problems are not under \ncontrol.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including her credibility and openness at the hearing. Applicant had \ncircumstances that occurred beyond her control and she has made strides in rectifying \nher financial situation. However, at this time, Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

He also used \nvarious other illegal drugs. In 1999, while serving in the U.S. military, he tested positive \nfor marijuana and cocaine. He received non-judicial punishment and an other than \nhonorable conditions (OTHC) discharge from the service. In March 2005, he was charged \nwith conspiracy and homicide. He mitigated the Guideline J, criminal conduct security \nconcerns. However, he failed to mitigate the Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, security concerns, due to the recency of his marijuana use and his \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nActing under the relevant Executive Order and Department of Defense (DoD) \nDirective, on May 21, 2018, the DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline J.  \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017 pertain to this decision. \n\n   \nOn June 5, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On \nNovember 26, 2018, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing that was amended on December \n6, 2018, scheduling a hearing that was conducted on December 12, 2018.  \n \n \n2 \n \n \nAt the hearing, five Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 5) were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant submitted no exhibits. Documents submitted by Applicant as \nattachments to his SOR response were considered. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \ntranscript (Tr.) received on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted, with explanation, that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about April 2012 to at least June 2016. He admitted \nthe other illegal drug use alleged in the SOR. He admitted being discharged from the U.S. \nmilitary for drug use and being charged with criminal conspiracy and homicide. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and works with technical orders and laptops for a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 21) He is not married and has no children. (Ex. 1, Tr. 22) From July 1996 \nthrough February 1999, Applicant served in the U.S. military. (Ex. 1) In 1999, he tested \npositive for marijuana and cocaine. He received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 \nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). (Ex. 2) He was separated with an OTHC, \nwhich is the most severe form of administrative discharge. (Tr. 62) He listed his discharge \nin his August 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Ex. \n1) \n \nIn 1990, at age 12, Applicant\u2019s parents sent him to a two-week drug rehabilitation \nprogram after they discovered him with a bottle of chopped-up ibuprofen. They believed \nthe bottle contained a different drug. (Ex. 2) He asserts he was discharged from the clinic \nbecause he did not have a drug problem and his parents had sent him to the clinic as a \nform of punishment.  \n \nAlso in 1990, Applicant started smoking marijuana. (Tr. 22) From 1990 through \nJune 2016, he used marijuana. (Ex. 2, Tr. 6) At times not identified in the record, he sold \nmarijuana to his friends weekly or every couple of weeks. (Tr. 60) In 2009 or 2010, he \nstopped selling marijuana. (Tr. 44, 61) Between January 1999 and October 2008, he used \ncocaine seven times. From September 2011 until August 2013, he used \nmethamphetamine, and from November 2013 through February 2014, he used diazepam \nthree or four times a week. (Ex. 2, Tr. 53, 59) He used the diazepam to help him sleep \nbecause he had bad tooth pain. (Ex. 2) He obtained the drug from a friend who had a \nprescription for the drug. (Ex. 2) In October 2002, he used illegal mushrooms once a week \nfor three weeks. He used LSD four times in November and December 1998. (Ex. 2, Tr. 6) \nHe did not list any of his drug use on his August 2016 e-QIP. (Ex. 1) \n\n   \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2018 response to written interrogatories, he provided the \nfollowing information concerning his future intentions of drug use: \n \n3 \n \n \n \nAs of June of 2016, the use of drugs has not been an issue for me, I have \nbeen doing [a] study on drugs and the implications and effect that it can \nhave on a person\u2019s life. And the physical harm that drugs can do to an \nindividual\u2019s health. I believe in this time in my life, I can say the abuse of \ndrugs is no longer a choice of entertainment. And I have focused my energy \non more important things in my life . . .  I have a whole new perspective on \nlife, and plan on using it to obtain a sound mind and body.\u201d (Ex. 2)  \n \nAt the hearing, when Applicant was asked why he stopped using marijuana he \nstated, \u201cI just stopped randomly . . . I don\u2019t know [why I stopped] I just \u2013 no reason.\u201d (Tr. \n46) He has not undergone any drug treatment, rehabilitation, or assistance program. (Tr. \n46) None of his friends or family abuse drugs. (Tr. 55) He testified, \u201cso getting involved in \ndrugs would not be a very wise decision on my part.\u201d (Tr. 56) He hopes to further his \neducation by attending college. (Tr. 55)  \n \nAt the hearing, when Applicant was asked to provide a reason why he would not \nstart using in the future he stated: \n \nWell, I couldn\u2019t tell you that I wouldn\u2019t use in the future. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t \nknow anything about the future. I know right now I\u2019m not using. To me \nmarijuana is not a big deal, but like you said earlier, the federal Government \nlooks at it as it\u2019s bad . . . I can\u2019t promise you that I wouldn\u2019t do it again, if \nthat is what you\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t know if I would or not. (Tr. 47)  \n \nIn June 2005, at age 26, Applicant was involved in a murder. The victim and all \nothers involved lived within a few blocks of each other. Court documents indicate the \nvictim had been good friends with two of the individuals involved in the killing until June \n2004. (Ex. 4) The victim had previously dated the sister of one of the individuals convicted \nof killing him. The breakup caused \u201cbad blood\u201d between the victim and his prior friends \nrelated to the sister. (Tr. 28-29) Acrimony between the individuals and the victim \nincreased in the month prior the murder. (Tr. 29) The victim and one of the two individuals \nconvicted of killing him had previously been in a fistfight. (49)  \n \nApplicant was sitting around drinking and using illegal drugs with four friends. As \na group they agreed to go to the victim\u2019s house, without firearms, and beat up the victim. \n(Tr. 30, 31) Applicant accompanied his friends to what he was believed would be a \nfistfight. An altercation occurred, and Applicant was returning to the car when a friend in \nthe group pulled a shotgun from his pants and killed the victim. (Tr. 61)  \n \nApplicant and the others were arrested. From March 2005 through March 2006, \nApplicant remained in jail awaiting trial. (Ex. 2, Tr. 38) He was charged with first degree \nmurder, conspiracy, and the lesser charges of second degree murder and involuntary \n\n   \n \n4 \n \n \nmanslaughter. (Ex. 2, Ex. 3) Two individuals in the group were convicted of murder, one \nwas convicted of voluntary manslaughter, and Applicant and another were found not \nguilty. (Tr. 62) Being acquitted, he was never placed on probation or parole. (Tr. 62) \nApplicant has not seen or had any communication with any of the other individuals \ninvolved in the murder since seeing them in court in 2006. (Tr. 40, 57) He did not list his \narrest or charges on his August 2016 e-QIP. (Ex. 1)  \n \nIn December 2011, Applicant was charged with being under the influence of a \ncontrolled substance. He did not list the charges on his e-QIP. (Ex. 1, Ex. 3) The evening \nhad started with him and friends drinking and smoking methamphetamine. (Ex. 2, Tr. 41) \nApplicant explained things began to \u201cget weird.\u201d When Applicant saw one of his friends \nwith a baseball bat, he quickly left the residence and ran to a fast-food restaurant. (Tr. 41) \nThe police arrived at the fast-food restaurant and took him to the police station where a \ndrug urinalysis was conducted. (Ex. 2) He was placed in a holding cell for six to eight \nhours and released in the following morning. (Tr. 41) When he went to court, the charge \nof being under the influence of a controlled substance was dropped. (Tr. 42)  \n \nApplicant denies any intention to use illegal drugs in the future, stating he had \u201ca \nwhole new perspective on life and plan on using it to maintain a sound mind and body.\u201d \n(Tr. 56) However, he would not make an unequivocal statement that such use would \nnever occur in the future. (Tr. 56)  \n \nCharacter reference \n \nApplicant\u2019s cousin states that since Applicant moved to his current state, he is a \nquiet, intelligent, capable, honest and trustworthy individual. He is dedicated to his job \nand leads a responsible lifestyle. (SOR Response) A retired Air Force chief master \nsergeant states Applicant takes pride in job accomplishment and understands the need \nto protect information with which he is entrusted. (SOR Response) Applicant\u2019s immediate \nsupervisor states Applicant is eager to learn new jobs, quick to volunteer, performs all \ntasks in a timely manner, is very knowledgeable of his responsibilities, and is someone \nwho strives to and desires to live a wholesome life. (SOR Response) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \n\n   \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighting \nof a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that \nthe individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \n\n   \n \n6 \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n  \nApplicant first used marijuana at age 12 and last used it in June 2016, which was \nover a span of 28 years. On occasion until 2009 or 2010, he sold marijuana. He used a \nvariety of other illegal drugs including: cocaine, methamphetamine, mushrooms, LSD, \nand diazepam. His 1999 positive urinalysis resulted in non-judicial punishment and \nseparation from the military with an OTHC discharge. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \n\u201cany substance misuse,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for an illegal drug,\u2019\u201d AG \u00b6 25(c), \n\u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and \nAG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse \u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Given he used marijuana over some 28 \nyears to as recently as June 2016, it cannot reasonably be said that his marijuana use \nhappened so long ago or was \u201cso infrequent\u201d to trigger AG \u00b6 26(a) in mitigation. His use \nof other illegal drugs was infrequent and the most recent use of the other illegal drugs \nwas February 2014, almost five years before the hearing. He has established a pattern \nof abstinence related to his use of the other illegal drugs sufficient to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns related to those other drugs.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has some applicability because Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement and there is no evidence that he currently associates with drug-using \nassociates and contacts. AG \u00b6 26(b) provides: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant failed to list his illegal drug involvement on his August 2016 e-QIP. He \nhad last used marijuana two months prior to completing the e-QIP. At his hearing, \nApplicant when asked about future use of illegal drugs, he stated he would not say he \n\n   \nwould not use marijuana in the future. He was not currently using marijuana, but would \nnot promise he would not use it again. His statement raises doubt about his commitment \nand ability to abstain from future usage.  \n \n7 \n \n \n \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must \ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct \nsufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s present abstinence of two and a half years, as of the close of the \nevidentiary record, is very short in comparison to the 28 years over which he used \nmarijuana. He provided no corroborating evidence from others attesting to his change to \na drug-free lifestyle. Applicant has yet to establish a sufficient pattern of abstinence to \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns caused by his \nmarijuana usage in disregard of Federal law.  \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n \nIn 1999, while serving in the U.S. military, Applicant received non-judicial \npunishment after testing positive for marijuana and cocaine in a urinalysis. As a result, he \nwas separated from the military with an OTHC discharge. In March 2005, he was charged \nwith criminal conspiracy and homicide. In December 2011, he was charged with being \nunder the influence of a controlled substance. He sold marijuana until 2009 or 2010. The \naforesaid conduct and charges establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n\n   \n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31(e): discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less \nthan \u201cHonorable.\u201d \n \n \nThe criminal conduct security concerns have been mitigated by the following \napplicable factor: \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nIn June 2005, 13 years ago when Applicant was 26 years old, he accompanied a \ngroup of friends to what he thought would be a fist fight. The altercation resulted in the \ndeath of an individual. Applicant was in jail from March 2005 through March 2006, \nawaiting trial. At trial, he was acquitted of all charged against him. He has not seen or had \nany communication with any of the other individuals involved in the murder since seeing \nthem in court in 2006. He has not sold marijuana in nine or ten years. His 2011 arrest for \nbeing under the influence of a controlled substance occurred seven years ago, and the \ncharges were dismissed. His discharge from the military occurred almost 20 years ago. \nNone of these events are recent. There was no showing of recent criminal misconduct.  \n \n \nThere has been a passage of time sufficient to conclude that his questionable \njudgment and criminal misconduct will not recur. Although charged with criminal conduct, \nApplicant was never convicted of a crime. Non-judicial punishment is not equivalent to a \nconviction.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \n\n   \n \n9 \n \n \nGuidelines H and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was charged but never convicted of a crime. The underlying conduct \nleading to criminal charges being filed, his non-judicial punishment, his OTHC discharge, \nand 2005 homicide charge were carefully reviewed. His acquittal of the homicide and the \npassage of time mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. However, the drug \ninvolvement was not mitigated.  \n \nThe Government must be able to rely on those persons seeking security clearance \neligibility to comply with the Federal drug laws without regard to their personal interests. \nFor the reasons discussed, Applicant has raised enough doubt in that regard to where I \nam unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for a security clearance. \n \nThe decision to deny a clearance at this time should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and \nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the future. The \nawarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on \napplying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under \nApplicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should Applicant \nbe afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. Favorable consideration \nwould be given to additional months without any evidence of misconduct or illegal drug \nusage. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted. \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct. \nHowever, insufficient time as pass since his last marijuana use to mitigate the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement  \nAnd Substance Misuse:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant.  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u20131.g:   \n \nFor Applicant.  \n \nParagraph 2, Criminal Conduct:     \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n   \n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

However, \nhe used poor judgment by not complying with the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence in mitigation does not overcome the lingering security concerns under the \nguideline for financial considerations. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 23, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance required for a \nposition with a defense contractor. On December 15, 2017, Applicant provided an \ninterview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) could not make the affirmative findings necessary to \ngrant a security clearance. DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nMarch 8, 2018, detailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline \n\n \n  2 \n \nF). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs). The guidelines \nare applicable to all individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The AGs were made \neffective on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer on March 26, 2018, and requested a \nhearing. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on September 5, 2018, for a hearing on October 30, 2018. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. The Government\u2019s seven exhibits (GE) 1-7 and Applicant\u2019s 7 \nexhibits (AE) A-G were admitted without objection. The Government\u2019s discovery letter, \ndated April 18, 2018, which had been marked as GE 8, is remarked as Hearing exhibit \n(HE) 1. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 7, 2018. The record in this \ncase closed the same day.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s December 2017 PSI (GE 2), I advised him that the PSI \nmay not be entered into evidence without an authenticating witness. Alternatively, I \nadvised him that he could have a recess to review the December 2017 PSI for \ninconsistencies. He replied that he had no objection to the PSI\u2019s entry into evidence. AE \n2 was admitted into evidence. (Tr. 30-31) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR lists three allegations under the financial considerations guideline: SOR \n1.a - Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016; SOR 1.b - a \ndelinquent credit union debt; and SOR 1.c \u2013 a delinquent medical debt. Applicant \nadmitted the three allegations and provided explanations. \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and divorced. Since 1999, he has been earning college \ncredits and is one course short of receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree. He served in the \nUnited States (US) Navy from March 2000 to March 2004, receiving an honorable \ndischarge. Applicant has been continually employed from 2005 to the present. During \nthat time, he has received several training certificates in connection with his \nemployment. Since June 2007, Applicant has been working in communication security \nfor several different defense contractors. He has no issues with his security clearance \nwhich he has held since 2000. (GE 1 at 10-11, 11-13, 17-18, 41; Tr. 56-60, 62) \n \n \nIn December 2013, Applicant purchased a home (HX) for $420,000 in his name, \nthough his then-girlfriend provided unexplained financial help with the purchase. He \n\n \n  3 \n \nfinanced the entire amount of the purchase with a Veterans Affairs (VA) loan at a fixed \ninterest rate. His then-girlfriend paid the utilities and food, and Applicant paid the \nmortgage and insurance. At the time of the purchase of HX, Applicant was renting out a \ntownhouse (not listed in the SOR) that he had purchased in 2005. After his girlfriend left \nhim in March 2014, Applicant had trouble managing all the financial responsibilities of \nHX. His financial problems increased in December 2014 or January 2015, when his \nrenters moved out of the townhouse and Applicant was unable to rent the property. \nAfter the first and second mortgages on the townhouse became delinquent, he sold the \ntownhouse in a short-sale. The resulting deficiency balance after the short-sale was \nforgiven by the mortgage lender. (GE 1 at 42; GE 2 at 4; Tr. 50, 65-69) \n \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Following his March 2014 breakup, and losing the renters of his \ntownhouse, Applicant began misusing credit cards to supplement his income so he \ncould pay bills. In September 2016, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, \nlisting $457,000 in liabilities and assets of $390,580. He included HX ($420,000) in the \nChapter 13 petition, along with a car loan, utility accounts, medical accounts, and two \nfederal credit union accounts. One of the credit union accounts was a credit card (SOR \n1.b), and one was a personal loan (unlisted). The payment terms of the plan were: $325 \na month for the first 14 months; $400 a month for months 15 through 17; and $965 a \nmonth for 43 months for a total of 60 months. The payment plan began in October 2016. \nIn June 2017, he moved out of HX and rented the property for $3,000 a month until \nJune 2018. The Chapter 13 petition plan was confirmed in September 2017. (GE 2 at 6-\n7; GE 5 at 13; Tr. 72, 75) \n \n \nApplicant testified that in September 2018, HX was placed under contract for a \nshort-sale. The contract price was $420,000, and Applicant owed $428,000 on the \nmortgage. He indicated that the buyer requested a 60-day approval process. Applicant \ncontacted the mortgage lender on October 29, 2018, and was told they were waiting on \nan unidentified document. He did not have a set date for finalization of the short-sale, \nbut assumed it would be before December 2018. There are several emails between the \nrealtor and Applicant, but no emails showing that the mortgage lender finalized the \nshort-sale, or that the process would be completed before December 2018. (AE C; Tr. \n52-53) \n \n \nAlthough Applicant claimed that he decided to place HX on the market shortly \nafter he filed the Chapter 13 petition in September 2016, all documentation related to \nhis efforts to sell HX occurred in 2018. Applicant seemed to modify his earlier decision \nto sell by indicating that he wanted to exhaust all avenues to keep HX. One of those \navenues was to acquire tenants (which he did between June 2017 and June 2018) for \nHX to generate extra money to pay bills and meet the Chapter 13 plan payments. (Tr. \n88-89)  \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the Chapter 13 trustee filed a Motion to Dismiss the Chapter \n13 Petition and Notice of an Opportunity for a Hearing. The trustee indicated that \nApplicant had defaulted on $2,850 in plan payments. Applicant admitted that he missed \n\n \n  4 \n \ntwo plan payments. Also, Applicant failed to provide the trustee a copy of his 2016 and \n2017 federal tax returns as required by the terms of the Chapter 13 order. Applicant was \ngiven until October 25, 2018, to provide a responsive pleading to the trustee\u2019s motion, \ntogether with a request for a hearing, or the case could be dismissed on October 25, \n2018. The record contains no documentation of a response by Applicant to the motion. \n(GE 5 at 11; GE 7) \n \nThe Chapter 13 payment history, which appears at the last page of the October \n2018 motion to dismiss, lists the payments Applicant made (and missed) between \nOctober 2016 and September 2018. Applicant attributed the missed payments to \noversight. In addition, he complained to his bankruptcy lawyer that the payment plan \namounts remained at the same level even after the renters of HX between June 2017 \nand June 2018, moved out in June 2018. Without the rental income, it was more difficult \nto make the higher plan payments. Applicant made the $965 payment on October 25, \n2018. (GE 7; Tr. 80-87, 93, 97) \n \n \nThough Applicant provided no documentation, he testified that a hearing date on \nthe motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was scheduled for December \n2018. He plans to have the short-sale of HX finalized before the hearing. Then, his \nbankruptcy attorney can inform the bankruptcy court that HX is no longer a liability and \nshould be removed from the Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 91-92) \n \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This credit card account that Applicant opened in 2012, became \ndelinquent in August 2016. The account is past due in the amount of $4,449, with a total \nbalance of $11,678. The account is listed in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. \n(AE E; Tr. 94) \n \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 This medical account ($1,880) became delinquent in 2017 and was \nplaced for collection. Applicant\u2019s documentation shows that he made a payment of $103 \nin May, $216 in August, and $216 in October 2018. In the future, Applicant intends to \nuse the creditor\u2019s website to make future payments. Besides the accounts listed in \nSOR, Applicant has an unlisted delinquent cell phone bill amounting to $670. The bill \nrepresents an outstanding balance with his former service provider that his new service \nprovider promised to pay when he switched service. (AE B; Tr. 97-102)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget since August 2018 has a net monthly remainder of $470 a \nmonth. His savings account is depleted to about $200 after he paid a $1,000 home \nowners association bill. He exhausted his retirement account in 2014. He has only one \ncorporate credit card which he uses on work trips. Applicant has had no additional \nfinancial counseling since the mandated counseling he received when he filed his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016. (GE 1 at 43; AE A; Tr. 102-107) \n \n \n \n \n\n \nCharacter Evidence \n  5 \n \n \n \nThe audit chief for a branch of a federal agency has known Applicant for a long \ntime as an employee and does not believe he is a security risk. He should be allowed \ntime to resolve his mishandling of unidentified financial matters. (AE F) The branch chief \nfor the same federal agency as the audit chief indicated that he has known Applicant for \n14 years and states that Applicant is not a security risk. Applicant counseled with the \nbranch chief about filing bankruptcy in August 2016. The branch chief advised him to \ninform his facility security officer and disclose everything about the process. (AE G)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare not inflexible rules of law, should be applied with common sense and the general \nfactors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concerns of the guideline for financial considerations are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n\n \n  6 \n \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016, claiming \n$457,000 in liabilities and $390,580 in assets (SOR 1.a). Most of the liability is from HX. \nThe delinquent credit union credit card debt (SOR 1.b) is included in the Chapter 13 \npetition. The delinquent medical debt, which is outside of the Chapter 13 petition, is set \nforth at SOR 1.c. The failure of Applicant to comply with all terms of the Chapter 13 \norder, invoke the application following disqualifying conditions under of AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nIn March 2014, four months after Applicant and his former girlfriend purchased \nHX, she broke up with him, shifting all HX financial responsibilities to Applicant. In \nDecember 2014, his renters vacated his townhouse. Applicant successfully sold the \ntownhouse in a short-sale. The resulting deficiency balance was forgiven by the \nmortgage lender. The mitigation available under AG \u00b6 20(b) is reduced by the passage \nof more than three years since the foregoing events. \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanations of oversight and a high payment plan schedule are not \ncredible. The oversight explanation does not make sense given Applicant\u2019s testimonial \nclaim of exploring all avenues to try to save HX. If he was as focused as he claims in \nkeeping HX, it was essential for him to conscientiously meet all payments under the \nChapter 13 plan, or seek a payment plan modification through his bankruptcy attorney \nand the bankruptcy trustee. His complaint of an excessive payment schedule is not \ncredible given the fact that he was on notice when he began making payments under \n\n \n  7 \n \nthe Chapter 13 petition in 2016 that his payments would reach $965 a month in the 18th \nmonth of the payment plan.  \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss the Chapter \n13 case because Applicant missed $2,850 in payments since the inception of the \nChapter 13 plan in September 2016. Further, Applicant did not provide a copy of his \n2016 and 2017 federal tax returns as required by the order confirming the Chapter 13 \nplan. Applicant was given until October 25, 2018, to provide a responsive pleading to \nthe trustee\u2019s motion, together with a request for a hearing, or the case could be \ndismissed. Except for an unsubstantiated claim that a hearing was scheduled in \nDecember 2018, Applicant provided no testimony or documentation showing that he \nreplied to motion to dismiss. He provided no evidence of how he intends to address the \n$2,850 deficiency balance. Though Applicant receives mitigation credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(c) for receiving mandated financial counseling, there remains a real possibility that \nthe Chapter 13 petition could be dismissed. The mitigation due Applicant under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is tarnished by the lack of a consistent track record of payments ordered by the \nbankruptcy court under Chapter 13 payment plan.  \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s evidence of a predicted short-sale of HX, there is no set \ndate for finalization of the short-sale, even though Applicant assumed it would be before \nthe December 2018 hearing on the motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. \nIn sum, without evidence of finalization of a short-sale of HX, the action that Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy attorney intends to take to modify the Chapter 13 petition by removing HX, \nthereby eliminating a substantial amount of liability, rests on speculation rather than \nevidence.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI have examined the evidence under the guidelines for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n  8 \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and divorced. He is one course short of receiving his \nbachelor\u2019s degree. He received an honorable discharge from the US Navy after serving \nfrom March 2000 to March 2004. Applicant has held a security clearance since 2000. \nHe has received several training certificates related to his employment in \ncommunication security. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence from the \naudit and branch chief of the federal agency where Applicant has worked for 14 years. \nHe has been employed consistently since 2005. I have considered the good judgment \nApplicant exercised in filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in September 2016 and \nlisting the SOR 1.b credit card debt in the petition.  \n \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant used poor judgment by not complying with the \nterms of the of the Chapter 13 payment plan. First, he did not provide copies of his \nfederal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 to the bankruptcy trustee as required by the \nChapter 13 order. Second, he has not fully complied with the payment plan set forth in \nthe Chapter 13 order. The $2,850 in missed payments was sufficient to convince the \nbankruptcy trustee to move for a dismissal of the full Chapter 13 petition. Third, \nApplicant provided no testimony or documentary evidence of a responsive pleading to \nthe motion to dismiss the Chapter 13 case. Applicant\u2019s documentation of a short-sale \ncarries little weight as there is no documentary evidence showing that the short-sale has \nbeen finalized. The short-sale is pending and the subsequent action to seek a \nbankruptcy court modification of the Chapter 13 petition is conditioned upon the \nfinalization of the short-sale. Neither event has occurred. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply \nwith bankruptcy orders and terms indicates he may not comply with rules and \nregulations for safeguarding classified information. Considering all evidence in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors, specifically the lack of credible evidence explaining \nwhy Applicant missed the Chapter 13 plan payments, he has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by the guideline for financial considerations.   \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n  9 \n \n          Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on (SCA) March 7, 2016. On \nMarch 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(December 10, 2016).\nApplicant answered the SOR on August 22, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on August 30, 2018. On September 4, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n02/01/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. The \nFORM included summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted on February \n10 and 24, 2017, and November 1, 2017. The PSI summaries were not authenticated as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was \nentitled to comment on the accuracy of the PSI summaries, make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summaries on the \nground that they were not authenticated. Applicant received the FORM on September 12, \n2018, and did not respond. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summaries \nby failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act \nlike lawyers, they are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights \nunder the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016).The case \nwas assigned to me on January 17, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations except SOR \u00b6 \n1.h, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old solution developer employed by a federal contractor \nsince January 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1999 and a master\u2019s degree \nin May 2004. He worked as a software developer for a private-sector employer from \nJanuary 2006 to November 2011, when he was laid off. He was unemployed from \nNovember 2011 to January 2013. He was self-employed from January 2013 to January \n2015, when he accepted his current position. He has never held a security clearance. \n \nApplicant has never married and has no children. He provided no information about \nhis income and expenses while self-employed or since his current employment in January \n2015.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling about $443,600. It includes seven \ndefault judgments totaling about $330,206, of which six are unsatisfied. The court records \nreflect that the default judgments were entered after notices were sent to the addresses \nfor Applicant\u2019s rental properties, posted on the rental properties, sent to his mother\u2019s \nhome, where he lived from 2006-2009, sent to his residence from 2009-2015, sent to \nApplicant\u2019s post office box, and served by publication. (FORM Items 7-13.)  \n \nMany of the debts are related to Applicant\u2019s investments in rental properties. The \ndebts are reflected in court records (FORM Items 7-13) and credit reports from October \n2015 (FORM Item 5) and December 2017 (FORM Item 6.) The evidence concerning the \ndebts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 3) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: judgment for $10,115, filed in November 2010. This is a default \njudgment for a delinquent credit-card account. (FORM Item 7.) During the February 2017 \nPSI, Applicant told an investigator that he was unable to pay this debt because he was \nunemployed at the time and had other financial obligations. (FORM Item 4 at 9.) The debt \nis not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: judgment for $44,999, filed in November 2011. This is a default \njudgment for a delinquent mortgage loan on a rental property. The October 2016 credit \nreport reflects that the property was sold after foreclosure and the debt has a zero \nbalance. (FORM Item 5 at 6.) This judgment is satisfied. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g: judgments for $60,981, filed in February 2012; $42,547, filed \nin August 2013; $35,081, filed in August 2013; $42,200, filed in January 2015; and \n$94,283, filed in June 2015. These are default judgments for delinquent mortgage loans \non rental properties. Applicant attributed these delinquencies to his unemployment from \nNovember 2011 to January 2013 and inability to find renters for his properties. (FORM \nItem 4 at 10-11.) In Applicant\u2019s SCA, he stated that the lender foreclosed on the property \nin SOR \u00b6 1.f (judgment for $42,200), but he submitted no evidence to support his \nstatement. (GX 3 at 45.) These judgments are not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: collection account for $23,836. The credit report from May 2016 \nreflects that this debt is a delinquent student loan being collected by garnishment. (FORM \nItem 5 at 3-4.) In the February 2017 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he fell behind \non his payments because he was laid off. (FORM Item 4 at 10-11.) The debt is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: line of credit charged off for $9,479. In the February 2017 PSI, \nApplicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was \ncharged off. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: collection account for $1,129. This debt is not reflected on the credit \nreports in the record. This allegation is not supported by the evidence. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.u: utility bills placed for collection of $364, \n$292, $88, and $73 (two bills). These debts were incurred when Applicant\u2019s tenants \nfailed to transfer the accounts to their names or failed to pay the bills. (FORM Item 3 at \n44; Form Item 4 at 12-14.) They are not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: collection account for $35,706. This debt is a delinquent credit-card \naccount. It is not resolved. (FORM Item 4 at 10.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: collection account for $32,575. This debt is a delinquent student \nloan being collected by garnishment. (FORM Item 5 at 3.) It is not resolved. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: credit-card account charged off for $8,605. In the February 2017 \nPSI, Applicant told an investigator that he did not intend to pay this debt because it was \ncharged off. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: debt to credit union charged off for $285. This debt is an overdraft \ncharge. (FORM Item 4 at 13.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: credit-card account placed for collection of $916. In the February \n2017 PSI, Applicant acknowledged this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 12.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.t: telecommunications account placed for collection of $49. This debt \nis reflected in the October 2016 credit report. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) In the February 2017 \nPSI, Applicant was unable to identify this debt. (FORM Item 4 at 15.) It is not resolved. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he asserted that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h and 1.i were duplicates. It is unclear whether the same lending institution is involved \nin both debts. However, the evidence shows that the debts are not duplicates. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h is a student loan, and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is a line of credit.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n\n \n6 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy \ndebts; AG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nrecent. The debts related to Applicant\u2019s rental properties (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g, 1.1, 1.r, 1.s, \nand 1.u) were incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely, because it is \nunlikely that Applicant will again venture as deeply into multiple rental-property \ninvestments as he has done in the past. The other debts alleged in the SOR were not \nincurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment, his inability to keep \nhis properties rented, and the failures of his tenants to pay their utility bills were conditions \nlargely beyond his control. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has been gainfully \nemployed for four years. He was aware of many delinquent debts when he submitted his \nSCA in March 2016, and he was questioned about his delinquent debts during the \n\n \n7 \n \nFebruary 2017 PSI. However, he submitted no evidence of efforts to renegotiate, \ncompromise, settle, or otherwise resolve any of his debts.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling, and his financial problems are not under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was resolved \nby foreclosure and the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.m were or are being \nresolved by garnishment. However, these involuntary measures do not constitute good-\nfaith efforts within the meaning of this mitigating condition. Payments by involuntary \ngarnishment are \u201cnot the same as, or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the \ndebtor.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-5700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-\n06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). Applicant has submitted no evidence of payments or \npayment agreements regarding the other delinquencies alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Although Applicant asserted that the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are duplicates, he submitted no evidence that he has disputed any \nof the debts with the original creditors, collection agencies, or credit bureaus. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n08/14/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems. It is too soon to tell if Applicant will follow through and resolve his \nindebtedness. In addition, the evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his January 2017 \nmarijuana use while holding a security clearance. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non July 17, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on March 17, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline H for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 9, 2018. He admitted all the allegations. He \nalso provided a three-page memorandum with explanations for the debts and proposed \ncorrective actions as well as an explanation for his marijuana use. He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 5, 2018, and \nthen reassigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place on December 6, \n2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary \nexhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-7. Applicant did not offer any documentary \nexhibits. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The hearing transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on December 13, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open for approximately 30 days, until January 4, 2019, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to submit documentation in support of his case. (Tr. 24, \n56-57) Applicant made timely submissions, by e-mail, and those matters are admitted \nwithout objections as Exhibits A-H.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance, albeit it at the higher top-secret level having previously been granted a \nclearance at the secret level. He is a logistics engineer for a large company in the \ndefense industry. He has been so employed since 2008. He began working for his \ncurrent employer initially as a contractor in 2005, and he has worked in the defense \nindustry since 2003. He earned about $81,000 in 2018. (Exhibit H) His formal education \nincludes a bachelor\u2019s degree in information technology awarded in 2008.  \n \nApplicant attributed his history of financial problems to divorce and the resulting \nfinancial hardship or distress. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 28-32) He married in May 2004 and \ndivorced in December 2016. Per the divorce decree, he is obligated to pay $1,600 \nmonthly in child support for three minor children. (Exhibit G) He described separating \nfrom his family and his divorce as a \u201clife-changing event\u201d with many difficult issues to \naddress. (Tr. 26-27)  \n \nApplicant admits a history of financial problems, which is also established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7) In particular, the SOR concerns \nfive delinquent accounts as follows: (1) a student loan account in collection for $27,189; \n(2) a consumer account charged off for $2,459; (3) a credit card account (stemming \nfrom a medical account) in collection for $2,256; (4) a credit card account (stemming \nfrom automobile expenses) in collection for $387; and (5) a student loan account with a \npast-due balance of $2,415 with a total balance of $44,652. Applicant has made some \nprogress in resolving the delinquent accounts, and he presented supporting \ndocumentation to establish that progress. (Exhibits A-E)  \n\n \n3 \n \nBeginning with the two student loan accounts, Applicant used the proceeds of the \nloans to obtain his bachelor\u2019s degree. He was unable to maintain the loan payments \ndue to his divorce and resulting financial hardship as well as the lack of any assistance \ngranted by the lender or creditor. Both loans are no longer with the original lender, the \nU.S. Department of Education, and were consolidated by another creditor. (Exhibit B; \nTr. 33-35) The total due for the consolidated account was $59,183 as of December 3, \n2018. He entered into a loan rehabilitation program in October 2018, agreeing to a \nmonthly repayment amount of $5 for nine months. Applicant thought $5 per month was \n\u201cridiculous\u201d and set the monthly payment at $125. (Tr. 40)  \n \nTurning to the three delinquent consumer accounts, the $2,459 charged-off \naccount was \u201csettled in full\u201d after the hearing. (Exhibit C; Tr. 34) The $2,256 collection \naccount is no longer with the original creditor, and the new creditor turned the account \nover to a law firm who initiated wage garnishment without success due to Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly child-support payment. (Exhibit D; Tr. 34-35) He had not made a payment on \nthe debt at the time of the hearing. Post-hearing in January 2018, the law firm agreed to \naccept $100 per month until the entire balance of $2,564, with accrued interest, is paid \nin full, with the first payment due on January 10, 2019. The $387 charged-off account \nwas resolved for a payment of about $192 in December 2018 or January 2019. (Exhibit \nE; Tr.34).  \n \nConcerning the illegal drug use, Applicant admitted smoking marijuana in about \nJanuary 2017, when he was on vacation visiting family in a state that has decriminalized \nmarijuana use. (Tr. 26-28) His marijuana use occurred about a month after his divorce \nwas finalized in December 2016. He described his marijuana use \u201cwas more like a \ntouristy thing to do\u201d while drinking beer and hanging out. (Tr. 27) He conceded there \nwas no justification for his conduct. (Tr. 27) He admitted that his marijuana use was \ncontrary to his employer\u2019s zero-tolerance policy. (Tr. 50-51) He admitted that he \npurchased the marijuana, which was a single container with two cigarettes. (Tr. 52) He \ndid not self-report his marijuana use when he returned to work after his vacation. (Tr. \n52-54; Exhibit 3) But he disclosed his marijuana use when he completed his July 2017 \nsecurity clearance application, describing it as recreational use of marijuana, and he \nstated that he had no intention to use in the future. (Exhibit 1) He has not used any \nmarijuana since the January 2017 incident. (Tr. 28) Post-hearing, he submitted a signed \nstatement wherein he pledged to abstain from all future [illegal drug] involvement and \nsubstance misuse. (Exhibit F) He also stated that recreational use of marijuana is not \nworth losing his career, and it was his responsibility to refrain from such activity.   \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n4 \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, the genesis of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nis his divorce, finalized in December 2016, and the resulting financial hardship or \ndistress it created for him. Those were circumstances largely beyond his control. He \nacted reasonably under the circumstances by honoring his obligation to pay child \nsupport for the benefit of his three minor children. But as shown by his recent remedial \nactions, he probably could have done more sooner to address his delinquent debts. \nGiven these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, and \nApplicant receives some credit in mitigation.  \n \n \nIt is too soon to tell if Applicant is adhering to \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve the \nfive delinquent accounts. With that said, he certainly receives credit for getting his two \nstudent loan accounts into a rehabilitation agreement. And he receives credit for settling \ntwo of the consumer accounts and entering into a payment agreement on the third. \nNevertheless, both the timing of the remedial actions and the length of the remedial \nactions are questions of fact that are relevant in deciding if an applicant has made a \ngood-faith effort. Here, Applicant entered into the rehabilitation agreement for the \nstudent loans about two months before the hearing and made the initial monthly \npayments. For the three consumer accounts, one was settled in full after the hearing, \nanother was resolved around the time of the hearing, and the third was entered into a \nrepayment arrangement after the hearing. Given these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the overall \nconcern is set forth in AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \n\n \n6 \n \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . . . \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana, which is \nlimited to the January 2017 incident, when he used marijuana recreationally while on a \n\n \n7 \n \nvacation in a state that has decriminalized marijuana use. His marijuana use was about \none month after his divorce was finalized. His marijuana use occurred while holding a \nsecurity clearance, giving him access to classified information for his job in the defense \nindustry. And his marijuana use was in violation of his employer\u2019s zero-tolerance policy. \nAny illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s security \nworthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs while granted access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana in January 2017 cannot be \nmitigated as a youthful indiscretion. As a working engineer for a company in the defense \nindustry, his conduct was particularly egregious. More is expected given his age, \nmaturity, experience, and lengthy work history as a cleared employee in the defense \nindustry.     \n \n \nApplicant presented a decent case in reform and rehabilitation. It is apparent that \nhe now understands the seriousness of his marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance. And I have no concern or worry that he has a substance-abuse issue with \nmarijuana. Nonetheless, I am not persuaded that he is an acceptable security risk. I \nreached that conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, his marijuana use was a serious \nlapse in good judgment. Second, it\u2019s unlikely that Applicant\u2019s January 2017 marijuana \nuse would have come to light in the near future but for the requirement to complete the \nJuly 2017 security clearance application. Indeed, he did not self-report his marijuana \nuse to his employer when he returned from vacation. His reluctance to self-report further \nundermines his suitability for a security clearance.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. Although Applicant \npresented some favorable evidence in mitigation, it was outweighed by the unfavorable \nevidence. In particular, his marijuana use while holding a security clearance is serious \nmisconduct that militates against a favorable decision. I conclude that he has not met \nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a -- 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations raised under both guidelines. He is 42 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been married and he has three children. (Tr.20) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems in 2015, and a graduate degree in business administration in 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2004 until 2015. Since 2015, he has served in the Reserve. Applicant has worked with his current employer since 2018. He has held a DOD security clearance for many years. (GE 1) In about November 2002, Applicant was charged with assault on a female. He and his girlfriend at the time were in a car and had a heated argument. As he was exiting the car, his girlfriend hit him in the back of his head, and he turned back and struck her in the face. (Tr.33, GE 3) She called the police and Applicant was charged. However, the girlfriend admitted that she struck Applicant first and the case was dismissed. At that time, a restraining order was put in place. The couple reunited and were driving when stopped by the police a year late in 2003. Applicant was arrested for violating a restraining order.

Continued eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under J (criminal conduct), and \nE (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 21, 2018, and requested a hearing. The \ncase was assigned to me on February 14, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April 1, 2019, scheduling the hearing for \nApril 10, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter, its exhibit list, and Applicant\u2019s exhibit \nlist as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9 were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through K, which were admitted in evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 17, 2019.  \n                                                                                                                                                        \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations raised under \nboth guidelines. He is 42 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he had never been \nmarried and he has three children. (Tr.20)  \n \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information systems in 2015, \nand a graduate degree in business administration in 2017. He served on active duty in \nthe U.S. Army from 2004 until 2015. Since 2015, he has served in the Reserve. \nApplicant has worked with his current employer since 2018. He has held a DOD security \nclearance for many years. (GE 1) \n \n \nIn about November 2002, Applicant was charged with assault on a female. He \nand his girlfriend at the time were in a car and had a heated argument. As he was \nexiting the car, his girlfriend hit him in the back of his head, and he turned back and \nstruck her in the face. (Tr.33, GE 3) She called the police and Applicant was charged.  \nHowever, the girlfriend admitted that she struck Applicant first and the case was \ndismissed. At that time, a restraining order was put in place. The couple reunited and \nwere driving when stopped by the police a year late in 2003. Applicant was arrested for \nviolating a restraining order. He and his girlfriend had been back in their relationship for \nsome time and the issue of the restraining order did not occur to them. They were both \nat fault, but Applicant was sent to jail for 48 hours. (Tr. 35) Applicant\u2019s girlfriend became \nthe mother of his child. They now have an amicable relationship, although they are not \ntogether. Applicant reports that she is a great mother. (Tr. 36) His former girlfriend wrote \na letter of recommendation for him. (AE F-2)  She recounted the details of the domestic \nincident in 2002, but stated that Applicant has been a great father to their son and is a \ntrustworthy person. She recommends him for the security clearance. (SOR 1.a-1.b) \n \n \nAfter these incidents, Applicant entered the military, earned a security clearance \nand served abroad. He obtained many medals and achievement awards. His record \nreflects his excellent career in the military. (AE 1-12) On his initial security clearance \napplication, he disclosed the above two domestic incidents. \n \n \nIn July 2014, Applicant was dating another woman. They were driving home from \na vacation with his son and her child in a rental car. He had been driving while his \ngirlfriend was sleeping. At some point, they engaged in a heated argument. (GE 2) \nApplicant returned the rental car and he and his girlfriend proceeded to drive to her \nhome in her car. His car was parked in her garage. When they arrived, she prevented \nhim from entering the garage to get his car and keys. Applicant went in to her garage to \nget his car and keys. (Tr. 63 ) According to the security report (GE 5) she repeatedly \ngrabbed him and once he was in the home and obtained his keys to leave, she blocked \n\n \n3 \n \nthe door and repeatedly grabbed him around the legs. (Tr. 38) Applicant pushed her off \nand she fell. The girlfriend called the police and Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith 2nd degree assault, reckless endangerment and burglary. (GE 7) When Applicant \nwent to court, the burglary charge was dismissed and the domestic violence charge was \nchanged to reckless endangerment. (GE 6) Applicant was given eighteen months of \nprobation that ended in 2016. (GE 2) This charge has been expunged from his record. \nHe was ordered to attend anger management classes from September 2014 to March \n2016. This incident was reported to his commander. (GE 2) He ended the relationship \nwith this woman after this incident. (Tr. 39) \n \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant had an encounter with a woman who was renting a \nroom from him. She started renting in 2015. He stated that they were not in a \nrelationship but had sex. (Tr. 40) He was charged with assault on a family member \nbecause she called the police and reported that Applicant had straddled her, grabbed \nher, and shook her. (GE 9) Applicant was dating another woman and the woman who \nwas renting a room from him was jealous. On February 22, 2016, the woman withdrew \nher statements about the incident and the case was dismissed. (GE 9) \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s fianc\u00e9e testified at the hearing. She has known him for about two \nyears. They do not live with each other. She has met his family and Applicant has met \nher daughter. They plan to marry. She has never seen any violent behavior in their \nrelationship. (Tr. 100) She is aware of the SOR allegations and they have discussed the \nvarious incidents. \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted about 16 character references and affidavits from military \npersonnel, colleagues and friends who have known him a long time. Each letter attests \nto his honesty, reliability and overall integrity. (AE F 1-10) \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly at the hearing that he was quite young when the \nincidents occurred in 2002 and 2003. The woman from those incidents is the mother of \nhis child and believes him to be a good family man. She wrote a letter of reference for \nhim. They maintain a good relationship for the sake of their child.  \n \n \nThere were no incidents of any kind for almost 11 years. Applicant dated many \npeople and was not always using good judgment in the relationship at times. He has \ntaken more anger management classes and has learned to walk away from certain \nsituations. He explained that he knows how to avoid conflict. He is in a stable \nrelationship with a mature woman who he hopes to marry.   \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely \nTo affect a national security eligibility decision, but when in combination cast \nDoubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nApplicant was charged in 2002 involving an incident with his girlfriend and in \n2003 with violation of a protective order. He was charged in 2014 with assault, reckless \nendangerment and burglary. In 2016, he was charged with assault on a family member. \nAG \u00b6 31(a,b) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred in 2002, 2003, 2014, and 2016. The \nincidents all involved women he was dating at the time. The early charges were \ndismissed and the woman has written a reference for him. As to the 2014 and 2016 \nunique incidents, the charges were either dismissed completely or a lesser offense was \nadmitted. Applicant completed probation and anger management classes on two \nseparate occasions and has learned from mistakes he made in certain relationships. He \nis in a stable mature relationship. He is cognizant of some of his poor choices in \nrelationships. I find that the incidents happened under unusual circumstances, they are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. He had a military career and good employment. He is a family man. He \nis mature and aware that he must deal with any conflict in an appropriate manner. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n\n \n6 \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nPersonal conduct allegations are cross-alleged in 2.a-2-2.d. As discussed above, \nApplicant has mitigated the SOR allegations under criminal conduct and thus since the \nsame incidents are referenced under personal conduct, he has mitigated those as well. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 (2a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J, and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified at the hearing. He has taken responsibility by taking \nanger management classes on two occasions.  He served in the military and has many \ncertificates of achievement and awards. He submitted many character references, \nincluding one from the mother of his first child who was involved in the incident in 2002 \n\n \n7 \n \nand 2003. He was candid, sincere, and remorseful. He disputed the last incident in \n2016, and the charge was dismissed. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under criminal conduct and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment with a federal contractor for gross negligence in September 2016, after his employer\u2019s internal investigation determined that he intentionally and knowingly manipulated program performance test data. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his employment for gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally or knowingly manipulated the data. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 62-year-old design engineer working for a federal contractor. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1985, and received a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) in 2017, both from U.S. universities. He married in 1982, and has two adult children. Between 2000 and 2010, Applicant worked for federal contractor \u201c1.\u201d He worked for federal contractor \u201c2\u201d from 2010 until he was terminated in September 2016 for gross negligence and intentionally and knowingly manipulating program performance test data. An adverse incident report was submitted by contractor \u201c2\u201d to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office shortly after Applicant\u2019s termination in September 2016. He has held a clearance since about 2007. Applicant was unemployed between September 2016 and January 2017.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n07/24/2019 \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was terminated from his employment for gross negligence after he \nmanipulated program performance test data. His evidence is insufficient to establish \nthat his family is aware of his misconduct and his termination. He deliberately failed to \ninform his current employer of his 2016 termination. He is still vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. He failed to demonstrate his reliability, trustworthiness, ability \nto comply with the law, rules and regulations, and his ability to protect classified \ninformation. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. Clearance denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 9, 2017. \nAfter reviewing the SCA and the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \non April 10, 2018, explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. Security \nconcerns were raised under Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant denied the sole \nSOR allegation, submitted 13 pages in mitigation and extenuation, and requested a \ndecision based on the record in lieu of a hearing. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), submitting the \nevidence supporting the security concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter dated \nFebruary 4, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on February 13, 2019. He was allowed \n30 days to submit any objections to the FORM and to provide material to refute, \nextenuate, and mitigate the concerns. Applicant responded to the FORM with a six page \ndocument that I made part of the record. He raised no objections. The case was \nassigned to me on April 12, 2019. I admitted and considered the Government\u2019s \nproposed evidence and Applicant\u2019s submissions.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment with a \nfederal contractor for gross negligence in September 2016, after his employer\u2019s internal \ninvestigation determined that he intentionally and knowingly manipulated program \nperformance test data. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his employment \nfor gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally or knowingly \nmanipulated the data. \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of \nfact:  \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old design engineer working for a federal contractor. He \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1983. He earned a master\u2019s degree in 1985, and \nreceived a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) in 2017, both from U.S. universities. He married in \n1982, and has two adult children.  \n \nBetween 2000 and 2010, Applicant worked for federal contractor \u201c1.\u201d He worked \nfor federal contractor \u201c2\u201d from 2010 until he was terminated in September 2016 for gross \nnegligence and intentionally and knowingly manipulating program performance test \ndata. An adverse incident report was submitted by contractor \u201c2\u201d to the Defense \nIndustrial Security Clearance Office shortly after Applicant\u2019s termination in September \n2016. He has held a clearance since about 2007. \n \nApplicant was unemployed between September 2016 and January 2017. He was \nhired and has been working for his current employer and security sponsor, federal \ncontractor \u201c3,\u201d since January 2017.  \n \nIn his response to Section 13A (Employment Activities) of his March 2017 SCA, \nApplicant disclosed that he was terminated by contractor \u201c2\u201d after some data anomaly \nwas discovered accidentally in September 2016 and he was blamed for it. He stated he \ndid not remember exactly what happened three years ago, but that he was terminated \nfor gross negligence.  \n \nApplicant admitted to committing gross negligence in an email to a supervisor \nand others, dated May 5, 2016. (Applicant\u2019s Memo 1-1) In that same email, he explains \nhow data could have been deleted and the wrong data overwritten. He stated:  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nI usually create working directory, and copy the results to the main \ndirectory, but in this case, it looks like the working directory I processed . . \n. . has been deleted . . . . so it is possible that this working directory got \ndeleted inadvertently . . . . before data had been captured . . . . I think it is \na strong possibility that I must have entered the wrong numbers to \nproduce wrong results . . . . But, I tried to reproduce the results I got from \nthe scratch since I could not find the control files . . . . I think it is a strong \npossibility that I must have entered the wrong numbers to produce wrong \nresults . . . . I feel immense shame that this represents a gross negligence \non record keeping on my part. \n \nApplicant also admitted to his program manager that he intentionally substituted \ndata from another test into his test data. To substitute the data, Applicant had to \nmanually overwrite the test data results. A folder with data was erased from contractor\u2019s \n\u201c2\u201d network. The overwriting and erasing of the data was established through the \ncomputer logs. When questioned by a second coworker about the data substitution, \nApplicant stated that he wanted to \u201ccome clean\u201d and asked the coworker to pray for him. \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he had no recollection of \nknowingly and intentionally manipulating the test data. He also did not remember using \nthe words \u201ccome clean,\u201d but stated that if he used them, it must have been in reference \nto different data or in a different context. \n \nConcerning his admission of gross negligence in his email to his supervisor \n(Memo 1-1), Applicant believes that his statement was misunderstood by contractor \u201c2\u201d \nas an admission of wrongdoing and gross negligence. He stated that the gross \nnegligence he expressed was a reference to his own standard of not keeping the \npersonal record, but avers that the personal record keeping was not a contractual \nrequirement.  \n \nApplicant also noted that there were at least three engineers with access to the \nsame computer and data, and any of the three could have done what he was accused \nof doing. He believes that he was singled out by contractor \u201c2\u201d as a scapegoat for the \ncontractor\u2019s negligence in up keeping and maintaining its test equipment. \n  \nThe Department of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations submitted a \nreport of investigation (ROI) in September 2017. The report titled Applicant for fraud \noffenses (false pretenses/swindle/confidence game).  \n \nDuring his September 2017 background interview with a government \ninvestigator, Applicant stated that he had not disclosed his termination to any member \nof his family or friends. He lied to his spouse about his termination and told her that he \nhad retired early. When asked why, he stated that his native country\u2019s culture does not \nallow for the head of a household to be disgraced in the eyes of his family. He reiterated \nthat if this become an issue he would retire. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose his termination to his current employer, contractor \u201c3.\u201d \nApplicant told the investigator that this was a big trauma in his life. He is very \nembarrassed and has a difficult time talking about his termination. Applicant stated that \nthe incident cannot be used to blackmail him. He further stated that if his current \nemployer (contractor \u201c3\u201d) discovered the termination and fired him, he would retire. \n \nIn his answer to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant adopted the summary of his \nthree 2017 interviews. In his response, he indicated that when he was terminated, he \nhired an attorney to contest his termination and requested an administrative officer \nreview to be performed by contactor \u201c2.\u201d He did not follow up on the appeal of his \ntermination because the legal fees were too expensive and he had moved out of state \nto take the job with contractor \u201c3\u201d.\u201d He also stated that after his interviews in 2017, he \nhad a chat with his wife about his termination and she was now aware of it.  \n \nApplicant noted in his answer to the FORM that he had not disclosed his \ntermination for gross negligence to his current employer, contractor \u201c3.\u201d He explained it \nwas very difficult to for him to voluntarily disclose his termination after contractor \u201c3\u201d \nidentified him as a valuable asset and had spent more than $50,000 for his relocation. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June \n8, 2017.    \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant intentionally and knowingly manipulated program performance test \ndata, resulting in his termination from his employment with a federal contractor for gross \nnegligence in September 2016. Applicant admitted that he was terminated from his \nemployment for gross negligence, but denied any misconduct or that he intentionally or \nknowingly manipulated the data.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s emails and memoranda establish that he, apparently inadvertently, \ndeleted his working directory before the data had been captured and that he then \nknowingly entered the wrong numbers to produce the anomalies later discovered by \nemployer \u201c2.\u201d In his then correspondence, Applicant expressed immense shame \nhighlighting that this actions represented a gross negligence on record keeping on his \npart. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raises the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that \nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing . . . .  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists two conditions that are partially raised by the facts in this case and \ncould potentially mitigate the personal conduct security concerns:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was serious and not a minor offense, particularly \nconsidering that he was hired for his expertise and scientific abilities to monitor, \nconduct, and record test data from experiments. Applicant manipulated the data and \nfailed to disclose his misconduct and gross negligence for several years until the \nmistakes were discovered because the data recorded could not be reproduced. His \nactions are disturbing for a person of his education and work experience. They show \nthat he cannot be trusted to apply his knowledge and expertise, to do his job, or to \ndisclose problems to his employer when they occur. Under the circumstances, \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior currently cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \nApplicant has not admitted his misconduct and continues to perpetuate his false \nstatements to present. Furthermore, he has taken no positive steps to reduce or \neliminate his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He deliberately and \nknowingly failed to inform his new employer (contractor \u201c3\u201d) that he was terminated from \nhis prior employment for gross negligence and misconduct. Moreover, although he \nclaimed that he had \u201ca chat with his wife,\u201d his statement alone, in light of his other \nmisrepresentations, is insufficient to establish that she and his family know about his \nmisconduct. Thus, he is still susceptible to blackmail, influence, or duress. \n \nNone of personal conduct mitigating conditions are supported by the facts and \nthey do not mitigate the SOR allegation, which continues to raise concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c), (d), and (e). Guideline E security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old design engineer working for a federal contractor. He \nattended a U.S. university and achieved a Ph.D. He has worked for federal contractors \nsince at least 2000, and held a clearance since about 2007. He was terminated from his \nemployment for gross negligence after he intentionally and knowingly manipulated \nprogram performance test data. Applicant disclosed his termination in his 2017 SCA.  \n \nNotwithstanding, his evidence is insufficient to establish that his family is aware of \nhis misconduct and his termination. He has deliberately failed to inform his current \nemployer of his 2016 termination. He is still vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress. Applicant\u2019s lack of judgment and his unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations continue to raise questions about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. The personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information granted. \nStatement of Case \nOn March 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR on April 24, 2018, and requested her case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing (Item 1). \nOn July 2, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was mailed \nto Applicant and received by her on July 13, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant that she \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant timely submitted a response \nto the FORM in August 2018, which contained numerous documents. I marked that \n04/12/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nsubmission as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. Items 1 through 6 and AE A are admitted into \nevidence without objection. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned this case to me on October 16, 2018.  \n \n \nAfter reviewing the file, I reopened the record on March 13, 2019, to give Applicant \nan opportunity to provide additional evidence regarding the resolution of her delinquent \ndebts. On March 27, 2019, Applicant timely submitted a cover letter with 24 pages. I \nmarked that cover letter with attachments as AE B. Department Counsel had no objection \nto that exhibit. \n  \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted all delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, except those in \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, \n1.j, and 1.l, which she said were paid. She admitted that she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nin 2010. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and never married.

She started working for her current employer, a defense contractor, in \nAugust 2016. Prior to this position, she experienced periods of unemployment between \njobs. (Item 2)  \n \n \nOn September 13, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SCA). In it, she disclosed a garnishment, a bankruptcy, and delinquent accounts, \nincluding several medical debts. She stated that she could not afford to pay many of them \nbecause she was supporting other people and unemployed at times. She disclosed that \nshe filed bankruptcy in January 2010 and subsequently discharged about $11,000 in \ndelinquent debts. (Item 2) \n \n \nOn September 6, 2017, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about her \nbackground and information in her SCA, including financial matters. (Item 3) During the \ninterview, she said that she filed bankruptcy because she was a single parent and could \nnot pay all of her daughter\u2019s medical bills and their living expenses. She used credit cards \nto pay bills at times. It is unknown if she received child support. (Item 3)   \n \n \nIn her April 23, 2018 answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that she had \nbeen financially irresponsible in the past. However, she stated that she has since learned \nto live within her means and has used a well-known financial management system to help \nresolve debts. She submitted several documents with her answer indicating that she had \nbeen making payments on some medical debts that were not alleged in the SOR. She \nalso noted that in July 2017 she paid off two open credit cards. (Item 1)  \n \n \nIn her August 7, 2018 response to the FORM, Applicant said that she paid off an \ninstallment loan on a vehicle she had purchased, and provided proof of the payment. (AE \nA) She also submitted a document indicating that, as of July 2018, she had paid about \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n$4,600 owed to a creditor for medical bills related to her daughter\u2019s illness. The initial debt \nwas about $9,000; the current balance is $5,139. She submitted a payment plan to \nresolve her outstanding debts, including the two largest debts alleged in the SOR: $6,873 \nand $2,562. She intended to begin the plan in November 2018, and have the debts paid \nby August 2019. (AE A) In her March 27, 2019 submission, Applicant stated that she was \nunable to follow through on that payment plan because she incurred about $2,400 of \nunexpected automobile repairs in November 2018. She said she subsequently paid the \ncar bills. (AE B)   \n \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in budget or credit counseling, but anticipates \nenrolling in a formal course in the future. (AE B) She submitted a budget. Her net monthly \nincome is $3,010. Her expenses are about $3,000, and include payments of about $400 \non delinquent debts and a $100 payment to the IRS.1 (AE B at 19)   \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from October \n2016, January 2018, and June 2018, the SOR alleged a 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \n16 debts that became delinquent between 2012 and 2016, and totaled $15,822. Eleven \nallegations were unpaid medical debts and totaled $5,199. (Items 4, 5, 6) The status of \neach alleged SOR debt is as follows: \n \n \n(\u00b6 1.a) This $6,873 debt is the balance owed to an automobile loan company for a \nrepossessed vehicle after it was sold at an auction Applicant said she voluntarily \nrelinquished the car because she could not afford it. She is trying to resolve smaller debts \nbefore working on the larger debts. (Item 3; AE B). It remains unresolved. \n \n \n(\u00b6 1.b) This $1,120 medical debt was paid in November 2015, as documented by \nApplicant during her September 2017 interview.

(Item 3) It is resolved. \n \n \n \n(\u00b6 1.d) This $637 medical debt was paid in January 2018. (AE B at 13) It is \nresolved. \n \n  \n(\u00b6 1.e) Applicant is unable to locate the creditor for this $599 medical debt based \non the information in the January 2018 CBR. (AE B) It is unresolved.  \n \n \n(\u00b6 1.f) Applicant settled the $535 credit card debt. She made a $144 payment on \nit on March 22, 2019, and is scheduled to make the final payment of $144 on April 2019. \n(Item 6; AE B) It is being resolved. \n \n \n(\u00b6 1.g) This $461 medical debt was paid in January 2018.

Applicant made a payment \non the debt in February 2019. (AE B at 16) It is being resolved. \n \n \n(\u00b6 1.p) This $174 medical debt was paid in full in December 2018. (AE B at 17) It \nis resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q alleged that in January 2010, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In \nMay 2010, the bankruptcy was discharged. She estimated that the court discharged about \n$11,000 of delinquent debts. Applicant said she filed the bankruptcy because she was a \nsingle mother raising her daughter and could not afford to pay medical bills and other \nexpenses at that time. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters of recommendation from family members. They praise \nher hardworking and honest nature. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s project manager is aware of the \nfinancial problems alleged as part of the security clearance process, but does not believe \nthey interfere with Applicant\u2019s work or trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who is also \nthe human resource manager, stated that Applicant is an exemplary employee. (AE A) \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2 There is no identified creditor on this CBR or telephone number listed for this debt.  \n \n3 There is no identified creditor on this CBR or telephone number listed for this debt. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the pertinent AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations of the security concern, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nBased on her admissions and CBRs, Applicant has a history of being unable to \nmeet financial obligations, which began prior to her filing a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010 \nand continues into the present. The evidence raises security concerns under the above \ndisqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate \nthose concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Four are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has had ongoing financial problems since 2010, when she filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. Although she has resolved or is resolving 11 of the 16 delinquent \ndebts, five remain unresolved. The evidence establishes limited mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(a). Applicant attributed the delinquent debts and bankruptcy to having insufficient \nmoney to support herself and daughter, and to pay medical expenses. It is unknown \nwhether she received child support. She also admitted that she had irresponsibly \nmanaged her money at some point. To the extent that the financial problems arose from \ncircumstances beyond her control and she attempted to manage them through payment \nplans and a budget, AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. There is insufficient evidence that she \nparticipated in formal credit or financial counseling and that all delinquent debts are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. She provided evidence that she made good-faith \nefforts to repay or resolve 11 of the 16 delinquent SOR-alleged debts, including two debts \nthat were paid after she received the order re-opening the record. She established some \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) as to those debts. She provided evidence that in July 2018, \nshe paid off her current automobile loan. She has significantly reduced the balance on a \nlarge debt owed to a creditor, further demonstrating good-faith efforts to address debts \nand establishing the application of AG \u00b6 20(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nApplicant is a mature individual who began working for a defense contractor in \nAugust 2016. In her September 2016 SCA, she honestly disclosed derogatory information \nrelated to her finances and delinquent debts, including a 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nSince working in her current position, she has been steadily resolving debts, including \none that was not alleged on the SOR. She resolved, or is resolving, 11 of the 16 alleged \ndebts that total $4,889. She stated she intends to address the two largest SOR debts, \n$6,873, and $2,562, after she finishes paying smaller debts. She has a budget that \nincludes payments on delinquent debts. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element \nin the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrates that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.4 \n \n \nApplicant established a track record of managing debts and finances, and is \ndemonstrating reliability. Her employer is aware of the financial problems and continues \nto support her request for a security clearance. Applicant is cognizant that further financial \ndelinquencies or problems may jeopardize her position with the defense contractor. She \nhas satisfactorily exhibited a commitment to resolving the delinquent debts. Based on her \nactions to date, I do not have questions or concerns about her reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. I find she mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n       FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:  \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3) App. Bd.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 22, 2016. On March \n9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 5, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 24, 2018, and \n12/26/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nthe case was assigned to an administrative judge on August 9, 2018. On September 11, \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for October 17, 2018. The case was reassigned to me on October \n16, 2018, due to illness of the assigned judge. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection. I kept the record open until October \n31, 2018, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted \nAX B through D. AX B was an encrypted document that could not be opened. It pertained \nto a debt not alleged in the SOR. I contacted Applicant on December 6, 2018, and \nrequested that he send an unencrypted version of the document, but he did not respond. \n(Hearing Exhibit I.) I did not admit AX B. AX C and D were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 24, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old tactical communicator employed by defense contractors \nsince June 2012. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from October 1998 to June \n2012, attained the rank of staff sergeant, and received an honorable discharge because \nof his inability to maintain weight standards due to a medical condition. He is taking online \ncollege courses and expects to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree by the end of 2018. (Tr. 31-\n32.) He has held a security clearance since 1998 and received eligibility for access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) in November 2008. (Tr. 34.)  \n \n \nApplicant enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1997 and was assigned to a \nSpecial Forces unit. He was assigned to an installation in the United States from 1998 to \n2001. During this time he was single and followed the \u201cSam Walton\u201d practice: \u201cIf you can\u2019t \nafford it, you don\u2019t buy it.\u201d From 2001 until 2012, he was deployed most of the time. He \nmarried in 2004, and has two children from the marriage, ages 14 and 11. He trusted his \nwife to manage the family finances while he was deployed. (Tr. 27.) His wife incurred \nseveral of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and used a power of attorney to open \naccounts in his name without his knowledge. (Tr. 53.) Except for the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, he did not specifically identify which accounts were opened without his knowledge \nor consent. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $27,000, which are reflected \nin credit reports from August 2016 (GX 2) and February 2018 (GX 3). In October 2017, \nApplicant and his wife joined a personal finance counseling group that met weekly. They \ncompleted the program December 2017. The leader of the counseling group considers \nApplicant and his wife as \u201cone of the success stories\u201d for the counseling group. (Answer \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nto SOR; AX A.) The counseling program assigns a sponsor to each participant. Applicant \ntestified that he meets with his sponsor about every two weeks to review his progress. \n(Tr. 71.) He testified that he received financial counseling while he was on active duty, \nbut he enrolled in the most recent course so that his wife would attend it. His wife now \nunderstands that \u201cdebt doesn\u2019t have to be a lifestyle.\u201d (Tr. 44.) Their plan is to set aside \n$1,000 per month and use it to pay off delinquent debts. (Tr. 69.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $5,556 per month, and he receives disability \npay of $1,809 per month. His wife has been employed since September 2017, and her \ntake-home pay is about $1,750 per month. Their monthly budget accounts for all their \nmonthly income. It provides for payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, \n1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k, and a monthly contribution of $1,096.50 to an \u201cemergency fund. (Tr. \n36-38; AX C.) \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: military credit-card account placed for collection of $13,877. \nApplicant testified that he has been making monthly $150 payments for about two years, \nbut the finance fees limited his progress in reducing the debt. His budget provides for a \nmonthly $150 payment on this account, but he submitted no documentation that any \nmonthly payments have been made. He made a lump-sum payment in March 2018 that \nreduced the debt to $6,575. He testified that he is trying to negotiate a lump-sum \nsettlement but has not yet been successful. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 47-51; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: charge account charged off for $3,313. Applicant testified that he \nwas unsure about the nature of this debt. He contacted the creditor after receiving the \nSOR, but he has been unable to negotiate a payment agreement. His budget provides \nfor a monthly payment of $58.75 to this creditor, but he submitted no documentation of \nany payments. (Tr. 54-56; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: delinquent rent placed for collection of $1,554. Applicant testified \nthat this debt was incurred for rent while a home was being cleaned after they vacated it. \nThey contacted the creditor about a possible payment agreement, but the creditor insisted \non full payment. The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 57-58.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $1,173. Applicant testified that \nhis wife opened this account without his knowledge. He was not sure if he had made any \npayments on this debt. (Tr. 58-59.) His budget provides for a monthly $35 payment to this \ncreditor, but he submitted no documentation of payments. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,007. At the hearing, \nApplicant was not sure if he had made any payments on this account. (Tr. 60.) It is not \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: payday loan placed for collection of $500. This debt was paid in full \nin March 2018. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 60.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: charge account charged off for $421. Applicant testified that he was \nmaking payments on this debt. His budget provides for a monthly $70 payment to this \ncreditor, but he submitted no documentation of any payments. (Tr. 61; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: online charge account charged off for $263. Applicant testified that \nhe contacted the creditor in March 2018 and has offered to pay the debt in full, but that \nthe creditor cannot find his account. (Tr. 63.) The debt is not resolved. (Tr. 62.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: online charge account placed for collection of $855. Applicant \ntestified that he offered to make monthly payments in March 2018, but the collection \nagency was unable to find his account. (Tr. 64.) His budget provides for a monthly $142 \npayment to this creditor, but he submitted no documentation of any payments. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: charge account placed for collection of $507. Applicant testified that \nhe had a payment agreement for this debt, but he was not sure whether any payments \nhad been made. (Tr. 65-66.) His budget provides for a payment of $58.75 to this creditor, \nbut he submitted no documentation of any payments. (AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: charge account placed for collection of $165. Applicant testified \nthat the collection agency was unable to locate his account. His budget provided for \npayment in full in October 2018, but he submitted no documentation that he paid it. (Tr. \n66; AX C.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: satellite-television service placed for collection of $206. Applicant \ntestified that this debt was the final bill for service and had been paid, but he submitted \nno documentation of payment. (Tr. 66.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: bank loan placed for collection of $3,497. At the hearing, Applicant \nwas unsure about the nature of this loan. He testified that he contacted the bank in March \n2018, but the bank insisted on full payment. (Tr. 67-68.) \n \n \nA co-worker, who has known Applicant since July 2016 and has daily contact with \nhim, testified that Applicant is \u201cone of the most thrifty, cost-conscious, less excessive \npersonalities\u201d that he has encountered. He has no reason to question Applicant\u2019s \nreliability or trustworthiness. (Tr. 19-25.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n\n \n5 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).The \nfollowing mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The financial irresponsibility and misuse of a \npower of attorney by Applicant\u2019s wife were circumstances beyond his control. However, \nhe has not provided evidence of responsible conduct. He completed a credit-counseling \ncourse in December 2017, but he has not provided documentary evidence of any \nsignificant steps to resolve his delinquent debts until March 2018, after he received the \nSOR.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant completed a financial counseling \ncourse, but he has not shown \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial problems are under \ncontrol. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \nApplicant has a plan, but he has not presented evidence of significant actions to \nimplement it. He paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f after he received the SOR. He has \nnot submitted evidence that he made any payments on any debts before he received the \nSOR. He claimed that he had been making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nfor two years, but he submitted no documentary evidence to support his claim. Applicants \nwho claim that debts have been or are being resolved are expected to present \ndocumentary evidence supporting their claim. ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nOct. 19, 2016). The mitigating effect of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent debts \nis diminished by the fact that they all occurred after he received the SOR. An applicant \nwho waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-\n01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not submitted evidence that he \ndisputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR with the original creditors, collection \nagencies, or credit bureaus. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, the testimony of his co-worker, and his candor and sincerity at the hearing. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information and \nSCI. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

She did not make sufficient progress resolving her delinquent debts. \nFinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.      \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 27, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. \n \nOn September 26, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On October 19, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On \nOctober 29, 2018, the case was assigned to me. Applicant was unavailable in December \n2018, and the case was delayed until January 2019. (HE 1A) On January 17, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s \nhearing for January 24, 2019. (HE 1B) The hearing was delayed due to snow at \nApplicant\u2019s location. (HE 1C) On January 28, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for February 8, 2019. (HE 1D) The hearing was held as scheduled \nusing video teleconference.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered nine exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; \nthere were no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. \n13, 17; GE 1-9) On February 21, 2019, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the \nhearing. The record initially closed on April 10, 2019. (Tr. 38-39) I granted an extension \nto April 17, 2019. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) B) Applicant provided six exhibits. (AE C-AE H)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through \n1.n. (HE 3) She also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by \nher current defense-contractor employer since August 2017. (Tr. 5-6; GE 1) She has \nnever served in the military. (Tr. 6) In 1987, she married, and her children are ages 24 \nand 27. (Tr. 6) Her husband has driven a truck for several years, and he has been an \nowner-operator of a truck for the previous two years. (Tr. 7) \n \nIn 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 1986, she received a \nbachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7-8) She has held a security \nclearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised security. (Tr. \n19)    \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant attributed most of her financial problems, including her federal income \ntax debts, to her unemployment for about 30 months and her husband\u2019s occasional \nunemployment. (Tr. 8-9, 22) She was unemployed from 2014 to 2016 and for several \nmonths in 2017 until August 2017. (Tr. 8-9) She was continuously employed from 1986 \nto 2013 by two large defense contractors. (Tr. 8-9) Applicant and her husband have \nseparate households in different states because of employment requirements, which \nresults in additional expenses. (Tr. 26) Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges the following financial \nissues: \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c allege Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Her 2011 federal income tax return was filed \nthree months late. (Tr. 27) She provided an IRS Form 1040 for her 2012 federal income \ntax return, and it is undated. (AE C) Her federal income tax transcript shows her 2016 \nfederal income tax return was timely filed. (AE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g allege Applicant owes federal income taxes totaling \n$40,828, for the following amounts and tax years: $13,695 for 2009; $4,674 for 2010; \n$4,050 for 2011; and $18,409 for 2014. She made payments to the IRS under an \ninstallment program from October 2015 to April 2017. (Tr. 22-23) She stopped making \npayments in April 2017, due to unemployment. (Tr. 23-24) Her payments under the \ninstallment agreement may also have been affected by her Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. \n(Tr. 25) She currently owes the IRS about $75,000. (Tr. 25) In July or August 2018, she \ncontacted the IRS and attempted to establish another installment agreement; however, \n\u201cit fell through.\u201d (Tr. 25-26) Applicant did not know why it was not reestablished. (Tr. 26) \nHer most recent payment to the IRS under an installment agreement was in April 2017. \n(Tr. 27)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in about September \n2016, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in about February 2017. Applicant completed \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 29) The bankruptcy court wanted her to pay $1,600 monthly, \nand she considered this amount to be unaffordable. (Tr. 29) The bankruptcy was \ndismissed. (Tr. 29; GE 8)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant had a mortgage in the amount of $448,867, and her \nmortgage was foreclosed around 2016. For one year, Applicant made her mortgage \npayments using funds from her 401(k) account. (Tr. 30) During her unemployment, she \nwas unable to make payments on her mortgage, and she had \u201cto walk away.\u201d (Tr. 31) \nShe did not know how much the bank lost on the sale of her home. (Tr. 31) Her Chapter \n13 documentation filed in September 2016, indicated the value of her residence was \n$293,609, the amount of the mortgage debts were first mortgage: $417,160 and second \nmortgage: $24,800, and the unsecured portion of the debt was about $148,000. (GE 8 at \n17-18) As of May 3, 2017, her mortgage arrearage was $32,121. (GE 9 at 3) The \nmortgage debt is listed on her October 19, 2018 credit report as a foreclosure account \nwith a last payment in February 2016, a balance of $448,867; however, the past due \namount is zero. (GE 5) The current status of the two mortgage accounts is unspecified in \nher October 19, 2018 credit report. From the information submitted, I infer the foreclosure \nhas been completed, and there is no proof of a deficiency. The debt is resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges an account placed for collection for $80. Applicant said she paid \nthis debt. (SOR response) The debt is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a past-due debt of $693 on a vehicle loan for $17,892. Applicant \nindicated she was not current on her vehicle payments. (Tr. 31; AE A, email of Feb. 8, \n2019) She said she would provide evidence after the hearing showing the status of the \ndebt; however, she did not provide it. (Tr. 32) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a delinquent debt owed to a city for $2,503; SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges \na delinquent debt owed to a county for $1,765; and SOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a delinquent debt \nowed to a school district for $4,727. These three debts relate to her residence that was \nforeclosed. (Tr. 32-33) While those three debts may have been paid by the mortgage \nlender to ensure clear title for the transfer of the property, Applicant may still owe them. \n(Tr. 33) Applicant did not provide updated status information on the three debts. The three \ndebts are unresolved. \n \nApplicant and her husband\u2019s adjusted gross income on their 2015 federal income \ntax return was $175,760, and she indicated that part of this income included funds from \nher 401(k) account. (Tr. 36) She owed the IRS $22,000 for tax year 2015. (Tr. 36-37)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget shows the following monthly amounts: gross income of \n$12,600; net income of $10,071; expenses of $5,801; debt payments of $1,579 (no \npayment to the IRS listed); and net remainder of $2,620. (AE E)  \n \nA manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly \nmotivated with exceptional potential. He is a retired Navy officer, and he supports \nreinstatement of her security clearance. (AE G) Another manager lauded her work \nperformance, positive attitude, and effectiveness. (AE H) \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing statement concluded: \n \nI am not trying to avoid my responsibilities, and I am embarrassed that I am \neven in this position in the first place. To begin this process, I am trying to \nwork with the IRS as well as a credit management company. I have the \nupmost respect for my Country and my company and would not put either \nat risk. Just as I love and respect my family and self that is how dearly I hold \nthe responsibility of the clearance. I know if given the opportunity I can work \non my finances and clear the concerns that this has set for the granting of \nthe Security Clearance. (AE F) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax as required.\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g allege, and Applicant admitted \nthat she owes federal income taxes totaling about $40,000 for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011 \nand 2014. Her historical financial record shows a mortgage foreclosure, delinquent local \ntaxes, delinquent vehicle loan, and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy dismissed for failure to make \npayments. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;1   \n \n                                            \n1The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n  \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions apply to all SOR allegations; however, Applicant \npresented some important mitigating information. Applicant and her spouse had multiple \nperiods of unemployment, and she and her spouse currently have separate households. \nThese unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and caused or contributed \nto her financial problems. Applicant is credited with mitigating several SOR allegations. \nAlmost all of her federal income tax returns were timely filed, and at present all of them \nare filed. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are mitigated. The dismissal of her Chapter 13 and her \nmortgage foreclosure were caused by unemployment, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are \nmitigated. She said she paid the debt for $80, and SOR \u00b6 1.j is mitigated. \n \nApplicant owes about $75,000 in delinquent federal income taxes,2 and she has \nbeen employed since August 2017. Her tax debt is for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, \n                                            \n2 Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges a federal income tax debt of $40,828 in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g. The \nSOR does not allege that she owes a total of about $75,000 in delinquent federal income taxes for tax years \nin addition to those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be \nconsidered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nand 2015. She under withheld federal income taxes from her pay, and did not pay her \nfederal income taxes in full when due. She has not been making payments to the IRS \nsince August 2017, when she resumed employment.  \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [the applicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is \nnow motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course \nof conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support \napproval of access to classified information).   \n \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence of progress resolving her delinquent \nfederal income tax debt, her vehicle debt, and three local tax debts pertaining to her \nforeclosed residence. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n                                            \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId.

Oct. 26, 2006)).  \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax debt exceeding $40,828 for additional tax years not alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nthrough 1.g will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nApplicant is 56-year-old supply quality engineer, and she has been employed by \nher current defense-contractor employer since August 2017. In 1987, she married, and \nher children are ages 24 and 27. In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and in \n1986, she received a bachelors of science degree in electrical engineering. She has held \na security clearance for 28 years, and there is no evidence that she ever compromised \nclassified information.   \n \nA manager where Applicant is employed described Applicant as diligent and highly \nmotivated with exceptional potential. Another manager lauded her work performance, \npositive attitude, and effectiveness. Her employment record supports reinstatement of her \nsecurity clearance. \n \nWhen Applicant and her spouse were unemployed, her family income was \nsignificantly reduced and her debts became delinquent. Applicant and her husband had \nto arrange separate households because of their employment in different states. I have \ntaken into consideration these circumstances beyond her control; however, she did not \nestablish her financial responsibility once she obtained employment. She owed three local \ntax debts related to her foreclosed residence, and she did not establish resolution of the \nthree debts or payment plans. She did not establish that her vehicle loan is current.  \n \nMost importantly, Applicant has a history of delinquent federal income taxes. Her \ncurrent tax debt totals about $75,000 for tax years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015.3 \nWhen an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nthe tax debt arose and the payment history on the tax debt.4 She did not provide a good \nreason for failing to resume payments once she obtained employment in August 2017.  \n                                            \n3 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance represents \nan obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor \nother obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information.\u201d). \n \n4 See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s \ncontrol adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \nwages, and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and \ninsufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. He failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish \nmitigation with respect to his student loan debts and delinquent federal taxes. National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented effective June 8, 2017.  \n01/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on May 7, 2018, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nits file of relevant material (FORM) on June 6, 2018. Applicant received it on June 15, \n2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant submitted \na one-page response to the FORM (Response). Items 1 through 6 and the Response are \nadmitted into the record without objection. The case was assigned to me on January 8, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is a high school graduate, and attended some college \nclasses between 2007 and 2010. He has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, \nsince October 2016. He is unmarried and has a ten-year-old child. He is current on his \nchild support obligation. (Item 2.)  \n \n \nApplicant was employed from 2012 to 2016 as a forklift operator. Before that, he \nworked in retail from 2008 to 2012. He also worked at a fast food restaurant in 2008. \nThese jobs were low paying positions and did not afford him sufficient income to repay \nhis student loans that he incurred while attending college. (Item 2; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is alleged to be indebted on 11 delinquent student loan accounts (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, and 1.f-1.l) owed to the U.S. Department of Education, totaling $32,442. He \npresented a payment agreement with a collection agency for the U.S. Department of \nEducation dated April 26, 2018, with his Answer to the SOR. That letter authorized \nrecurring payments to be withdrawn from his account, but did not state a payment amount \nor otherwise document any payments were made under that agreement. In Applicant\u2019s \nResponse, he indicated that he consolidated his delinquent student loans into one \naccount and that since April 2018, he has remitted $22 per month as required in the \nrepayment agreement. His June 5, 2018 credit report reflects multiple accounts owed to \nthe Department of Education as past due with the date of last payment as April 2018. It \nis unclear if he made any payments after his the April 2018 payment, which was \npresumably the first payment under his repayment agreement. His June 5, 2018 credit \nreport also shows multiple other student loans were transferred or sold. Applicant did not \nprovide enough evidence to establish a track record of responsibility for these delinquent \nstudent loan accounts. These debts are unresolved. (Answer; Response; Item 3; Item 4; \nItem 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant also owes approximately $2,812 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) to the university he \nattended for another student loan. His Answer and Response indicate that all of his \nstudent loans have been \u201cconsolidated into one monthly payment plan\u201d but there is no \nevidence that indicates this debt was included in that agreement. This debt became \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndelinquent in 2011. It is identified on his June 5, 2018 credit report as past due and no \nrecent payments are reflected. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; Response; Item 3 at 7; \nItem 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant is indebted to the IRS in the amount of $5,284 for tax years \n2014, 2015, and 2016, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. He filed his tax returns for those years \nin a timely manner, but had insufficient funds to pay the balance owed. Tax transcripts for \nthose tax years reflect that he established an installment agreement with the IRS to \nresolve his delinquencies in April 2017, but was no longer in installment status in March \n2018. (Item 3.) He documented that he re-engaged the IRS in April 2018 and established \na new agreement to pay $64 per month. (Answer.) In his Response, he indicated he was \ncurrent with that agreement, but provided no documentation to show a track record of \npayments under that agreement.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s June 5, 2018 credit report reflects that he has an additional delinquent \naccount, owed to a payday-loan vender in the amount of $616. (Item 6.)1 He admitted this \ndebt in his Response and explained: \u201cIn my current financial situation, I am living \n\u2018paycheck to paycheck\u2019, meaning, after I am finished paying my monthly rent and utilities \nand other expenses that are required raising my son, I am not left with extra funds.\u201d \nDespite his shortfall, he intends to pay all his delinquent debt when he is able. \n(Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n                                                          \n1 These debts were not alleged on the SOR and are not considered under the disqualifying conditions, \nbelow, but are appropriate to examine when analyzing mitigation. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has over $35,000 in delinquent student loan debt, plus over $5,000 in \ndelinquent tax debt. He has been delinquent on his student loans since at least 2011. \nDespite being fully employed since 2016, he has insufficient income to address these \nliabilities. There is sufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(c), and 19(f). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant has insufficient income to meet all of his financial obligations. He has \nincurred additional delinquent debt, not alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence that he \nwill be able to avoid delinquent accounts in the future. He remains indebted for federal \ntaxes and student loans. His debt is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to underemployment. That is a \ncircumstance beyond his control. However, he has been fully employed since 2016, and \ncontinues to be unable to meaningfully address his delinquent accounts. The record lacks \ndocumentation to show he reasonably and responsibly addressed his delinquencies. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation of financial counseling. There is minimal \nevidence to conclude that his financial problems are under control. He has established \npayment agreements with the collection agent for the majority of his student loans and \nwith the IRS. However, he did not provide documentation to demonstrate a track record \nof payments in accordance with those agreements. The evidence does not establish full \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not claim to dispute any of his alleged delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has established an installment agreement to resolve his federal tax \nliabilities. However, he defaulted on a previous installment agreement. He failed to meet \nhis burden to establish compliance with his current repayment agreement, beyond his \nbare averment. Documentation of compliance with those arrangements is necessary. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) does not mitigate the security concern. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \nrecent efforts to make payment arrangements to resolve his delinquencies with his limited \nincome. However, he failed to support his statements with proof of concomitant action. \nHe has no track record of payments to his creditors and his most recent credit report \nreflects a new delinquent account. He may be eligible for national security eligibility in the \nfuture if he is able to document reasonable and responsible actions to maintain solvency. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86)1 on \nMay 23, 2017. On March 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F.2 \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 17, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of \n1 Also known as a Security Clearance Application (SCA). \n2 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n02/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing on July 31, 2018, and the hearing was convened on August 28, 2018. \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, were admitted \nin evidence without objection. The record was held open to permit Applicant time to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. She submitted AE B, which was admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old business analyst for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2002. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998, and completed some credits toward \na master\u2019s degree. She married in 1993 and has one child and one stepchild. She has \nheld a security clearance since 2002. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant is indebted on three debts \ntotaling approximately $24,405. Applicant admitted the allegations, and provided a \nstatement explaining the circumstances for the debts. \n \n \nApplicant lived in state A and worked for her current employer. Her spouse is a \nretired civil service employee and also worked after retiring from the Government, in state \nA. In September 2007, Applicant was transferred to state B to continue working for the \nsame employer in a different location. At the time, the housing market was declining, and \nApplicant\u2019s home appraised for less than the mortgage. Hoping the market would recover, \nshe kept the home and listed it for rent in February 2008. The monthly rental income was \nhalf of the mortgage payment. At the same time, Applicant purchased another home in \nstate B. Her spouse left his employment and moved to state B with Applicant in June \n2008. In November 2008, Applicant\u2019s spouse suffered from a serious heart condition. In \n2014, he was diagnosed with final stage renal failure, and in 2015, underwent quintuple \ncardiac bypass surgery. He never returned to work after 2009, leaving the family with \nApplicant\u2019s income alone, two mortgages and other debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s home in state A was not generating sufficient income and she \nexhausted all of her savings to make up the difference in mortgage payments until 2009. \nSince the real estate market had not recovered, Applicant was forced to allow the home \nto be foreclosed. The lender took possession in 2010, and sold the home in 2011 for less \nthan half of the original mortgage amount. She does not owe a deficiency from the \nforeclosure. \n \nIn 2009, a credit card provider closed Applicant\u2019s and her spouse\u2019s accounts. This \nparticular credit card provider requires full payment of the charged amount each month. \nAlthough Applicant made payments on the accounts until 2012, she stopped when she \nwas no longer financially able to pay this debt and other debts. She described the action \nas a \u201cstrategic decision\u2019 to forgo payments on the credit cards in order to pay other debts \nand have sufficient income for her family. In October 2013, Applicant received letters from \nthe creditor showing the debts were nonrecourse, and that no legal action would be \npermitted to collect the debts. Applicant\u2019s September 2018 credit report shows that the \naccounts were closed and charged off several years ago, but notes the accounts were \n\n \n3 \n \nnever late. Applicant submitted disputes to the credit bureaus requesting that they \ndiscontinue reporting the accounts on her credit report. Another small medical debt listed \nin the SOR was paid. \n \nApplicant paid five other credit cards in 2015 and 2016, totaling about $20,000. \nThe family now has manageable debts including one credit card, a mortgage, and a \nstudent loan from Applicant and her son. Applicant inquired into employer-sponsored \ncredit counseling, but none was offered. She self-educated online, and produced a family \nbudget showing a take-home income of $95,000, a net monthly remainder of $1,116 after \npaying expenses, $4,000 in cash savings, and a 401(k) retirement account valued at \n$366,000. Applicant\u2019s testimony was forthcoming and sincere, and as suggested at her \nhearing, she provided explanatory information in her post-hearing submission. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts, and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence supporting the SOR \nallegations are sufficient to establish the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems occurred after she was transferred to another state \nand her spouse was unable to work again due to a serious medical condition. Faced with \na single family income, two mortgages, and a sick spouse, Applicant had to make financial \nchoices to pay some debts but not others. She contacted the creditor for two of the SOR \ndebts and discussed her family\u2019s financial status, but was unable to make the required \nfull payments on the accounts. The two credit-card debts from the same creditor were \nclosed and charged-off some time ago, and there is no recourse permitted against \nApplicant. Applicant has disputed their continued reporting on her credit report, but the \nreports show the payments were \u201cnever late.\u201d About $20,000 in other debts were paid in \nlieu of payment on these credit cards. These debts have been sufficiently addressed and \nresolved. The remaining small medical debt has been paid.  \n \n \nApplicant is now on solid financial footing. Her family income from her work and \nher husband\u2019s civil service pension are more than sufficient for her to meet all of her \nfinancial responsibilities. Despite a history of financial delinquencies due to circumstances \nbeyond her control, Appellant has now shown a track record of responsible financial \ndecisions and there is sufficient evidence to determine that she is living within her means. \nI find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances to address her debts with \nthe only means at her disposal given her difficult financial condition. Her financial \ncondition no longer casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d) apply; and \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (e) partially apply. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has \nundergone significant financial stress through no fault of her own, but acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. She allocated resources within her means to address debts as \nshe could, and the remaining two SOR debts were closed and charged-off without \nrecourse several years ago. I am convinced that a similar financial event is unlikely to \nrecur and that Applicant is financially stable. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \neligibility is granted. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 3 at 5)  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b are auto loans, with balances totaling approximately \n$56,000. Applicant used the loan account alleged in subparagraph 1.a to finance the \npurchase of a car for $42,000 in 2014. (Item 7 at 1) He used the loan account alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b to finance the purchase of a car in 2016 for $25,000. (Item 8 at 10) \nApplicant paid the past due balances on these bills in March 2018 after receiving the SOR. \n(Item 3 at 12, 14) They are no longer in delinquent status. \n \n \nThe debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.f  through 1.h, and 1.j are delinquent \nstudent loan accounts. Their collective balance totals approximately $29,000. Applicant \ncaught up on these accounts with a $461 payment in March 2018, after receiving the SOR. \n(Item 3 at 18)  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e, totaling $4,349, is a credit card account. In \nMarch 2018, after receiving the SOR, Applicant pre-authorized recurring $150 bi-weekly \npayments, scheduled to have begun in April 2018. (Item 3 at 15) \n \n\n3 \n \n \n   Subparagraph 1.i, totaling $1,191, is a utility bill. Applicant paid $500 toward its \nsatisfaction in March 2018, after receiving the SOR. (Item 3 at 20) Subparagraph 1.k, \ntotaling $596, is a phone bill. Applicant satisfied this debt in its entirety in March 2018, after \nreceiving the SOR.  (Item 3 at 22) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax delinquency, totaling $32,273, is alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.l. He filed the delinquent tax returns in approximately April 2017. (Item 6) \nAt or about that time, he arranged a payment plan under which he was to pay the IRS \n$1,800 per month. (Item 6) Six months later, in October 2017, he renegotiated the payment \nplan. Under the new agreement, the IRS reduced the payments from $1,800 monthly to \n$800 monthly, to be deducted from his checking account.  (Item 3 at 24) He presented no \nevidence of compliance with either plan. Applicant provided no evidence that he ever filed \nhis delinquent state income tax returns. \n \n \nApplicant owes the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.m, totaling $587, to a credit \nunion. He satisfied it in March 2018. (Item 3 at 23). \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n through 1.p, totaling approximately $12,000 are loan accounts \nthat Applicant and his wife used to purchase furniture before their separation in 2009. As of \nJuly 2017, he was working with a credit counseling agency to help him resolve these debts. \n(Item 1 at 10-11; Item 5 at 6)  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q and 1.r are medical bills totaling approximately $137. These bills \nhave been outstanding since 2014. (Item 8 at 21) Applicant is attempting to ascertain which \nof his dependents incurred these bill so that he can file them with the appropriate insurer. \n(Item 3 at 3) Currently, Applicant is preparing to obtain a legal separation from his wife, in \norder to minimize further confusion with respect to management of his finances. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n\n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. . . . .  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies trigger the application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s failure to file his state and federal income taxes for tax years 2010, \nand 2012 through 2015 triggers the application of AG \u00b6 20(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently \nfiling annual federal, state, or local income tax returns, or failure to pay federal, state, or \nlocal income tax, as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n\n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant attributes much of his financial problems to his marital separation. \nHowever, this occurred nearly ten years ago.  Since then, he has financed the purchase of \ntwo new cars, one of which was in excess of $40,000. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has brought his car loan accounts and his student loan accounts current \nby satisfying the respective delinquencies, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d, 1.f \nthrough 1.h, and 1.j, and he has satisfied the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.i. and 1.m in \ntheir entirety. The satisfaction of these debts is sufficient to apply AG \u00b6 20(d) and to \nresolve these SOR allegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that he filed his delinquent federal income tax returns, \nand provided evidence of a payment plan and a revised payment, but he provided no \nevidence that he has complied with either plan. Moreover, he provided no evidence that he \nhas filed his delinquent state income tax returns. Consequently, AG \u00b6 20(g) is inapplicable \nto the issue of Applicant\u2019s non-filed state income tax returns, and it is only applicable to his \ndelinquent federal income tax returns insofar as he has filed them and made arrangements \nto satisfy them.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide evidence of either federal tax payment plan compliance \nor of filing his delinquent state income taxes undercuts any positive inference from his work \nwith a credit counselor or the progress made at debt reduction. Therefore, I conclude that \nonly the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n                                                 \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n \n\n6 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nApplicant deserves credit for initiating payment plans and for satisfying some of his \ndebts. However, he did not make plans to pay many of these debts until after the issuance \nof the SOR. Moreover, he has yet to file his delinquent state income tax returns, and he \nhas provided no evidence that he is complying with the payment plan for his federal income \ntax delinquencies. Failure to file tax returns or to pay income tax debts are serious \ntransgressions as they suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-\nestablished government rules and regulations. (ADP Case No. 16-03595 (August 27, 2018) \nat 4) Under these circumstances, any indicia of financial rehabilitation is outweighed by the \nnature and seriousness of the problem. Consequently, I am unable to conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 1.r:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She explained that she was so \nfocused on answering the question about her student loans that she did not pay enough \nattention to this question. I find this explanation implausible.3 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 \n(HSPD-12); DOD Instruction (DODI) 5200.46, DOD Investigative and Adjudicative \nGuidance for Issuing the CAC, dated September 9, 2014; and the procedures set out in \nEnclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The specific \nissues raised are listed in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic Adjudicative \nStandards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The overriding factor \nfor all of these conditions is unacceptable risk.  \n                                                          \n1 Items 1, 5. \n \n2 Items 2, 5. \n \n3 Items 2, 4. \n \n\n \n3 \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \u00b6 1)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nEmployment Misconduct \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 1. provides: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s misconduct or negligence in \nemployment, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk. \n \na. An individual\u2019s employment misconduct or negligence may put people, \nproperty, or information systems at risk. \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 1.b lists several conditions that could raise a CAC eligibility concern and \nmay be disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(1) A previous history of intentional wrongdoing on the job, disruptive, \nviolent, or other acts that may pose an unacceptable risk to people, \nproperty, or information systems;  \n \n(4) Violation of written or recorded commitments to protect information \nmade to an employer, such as breach(es) of confidentiality or the release \nof proprietary or other information; and  \n \n(5) Failure to comply with rules or regulations for the safeguarding of \nclassified, sensitive, or other protected information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment termination due to her disclosure of confidential patient \ninformation in violation of federal law is sufficient to establish the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 1.c lists circumstances relevant to the determination whether there is a \n\n \n4 \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. The following may be \nrelevant:  \n \n(1) The behavior happened so long ago, was minor, or happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current trustworthiness or good judgment relating \nto the safety of people and proper safeguarding of property and \ninformation systems;  \n \n(2) The individual was not adequately warned that the conduct was \nunacceptable and could not reasonably be expected to know that the \nconduct was wrong;  \n \n(3) The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the behavior; \nand \n  \n(4) The individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial training \nand has since demonstrated a positive attitude toward the discharge of \ninformation-handling or security responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s termination for committing a HIPPA violation was recent and \nsignificant enough to cost Applicant her nursing job of 18 years. Applicant failed to \nproduce sufficient evidence establishing any of the circumstances listed above.  \n \nIntentional False Statement \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 3 provides: \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s material, intentional false statement, \ndeception or fraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.  \n \na. The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s honesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \nb. Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include material, \nintentional falsification, deception or fraud related to answers or \ninformation provided during the employment process for the current or a \nprior federal or contract employment (e.g., on the employment application \nor other employment, appointment or investigative documents, or during \ninterviews.) \n \n\n \n5 \nApplicant was fired from a job she held for 18 years because of her misconduct \nin violating federal law. Less than three months later, she completed a FORM 306. I find \nit implausible that Applicant would not remember a significant life event when \ncompleting the form. It is reasonable to infer that she intentionally failed to disclose this \ninformation because she was afraid it would harm her chances at obtaining the job. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are established.  \n \nDODI 5200.46, Appendix 2 to Enclosure 4, Supplemental Adjudicative \nStandards, \u00b6 3.c lists circumstances relevant to the determination whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk. The following may be \nrelevant: \n \n(1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, was minor, or \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \nand \n \n(2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent and \nwas followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s false statement was recent and significant because it concerned her \nfiring from her most recent employer for a federal law violation concerning unauthorized \ndisclosure of confidential information. Her actions were intentional and she did not \nengage in efforts to correct the situation. Neither mitigating circumstance applies. \n \nI am unable to determine that future employment misconduct or intentionally \nfalse statements are unlikely to recur. There is insufficient mitigation in the FORM to \nconvince me that Applicant does not pose an unacceptable risk. I also considered the \nfactors in DODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \u00b6 1. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Employment Misconduct:    \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Intentional False Statement:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, granting \nApplicant CAC eligibility poses an unacceptable risk.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGoldstein, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing eligibility concerns for Common Access Card \n(CAC) issuance pursuant to Homeland Security Presidential Directive\u201312 (HSPD-12) \nbecause it found it was an unacceptable risk to grant Applicant CAC eligibility. The \naction is based on the Adjudicative Standards found in DoD Instruction 5200.46, DoD \nInvestigative and Adjudicative Guidelines for Issuing the Common Access Card, dated \nSeptember 9, 2014, and made pursuant to the procedures set out in Enclosure 3 of \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The concerns raised under the \nAdjudicative Standards of DoDI 5200.46 are: paragraph 1.a - misconduct or negligence \nin employment; and paragraph 3.a - material, intentional false statement, deception, or \nfraud.   \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 18, 2018 (Answer), and requested a \ndecision based on the record. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) on September 26, 2018. Applicant received it on October 1, \n2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 5. The FORM notified \nApplicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n02/13/2019\n\n \n2 \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt of the FORM. On November 14, \n2018, Applicant submitted a 4-page response to the FORM (Response). Items 1 \nthrough 5 and the Response are admitted into the record without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old. She is a high school graduate. She has worked for her \nemployer since August 2017. (Item 3.) \n \n \nOn June 8, 2017, Applicant was involuntarily terminated by her prior employer for \nstealing money from another employee\u2019s purse. She indicated she \u201cimmediately \nregretted\u201d her decision and \u201ctried to put the money back\u201d but was caught in the act. A \ndisciplinary action form from Applicant\u2019s former employer documents the theft. (Item 5; \nAnswer.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s material, intentional false statement, deception, \nor fraud raised concerns under DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental \nAdjudicative Standards. Specifically, it alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a \nDeclaration for Federal Employment form (306), signed by Applicant on September 26, \n2017, when she failed to disclose she was discharged by her employer in June 2017. \nShe answered \u201cNo\u201d on that declaration to the question that asked whether in the past \nfive years she had been fired, quit after being told she would be fired, or left a job by \nmutual agreement because of specific problems. She admitted that she \u201cdidn\u2019t think \n[she] would get the job if [she] checked yes.\u201d (Item 4; Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for being dishonest. She has worked hard to be a \ntop performer for her current employer. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant presented four letters of recommendation from supervisors and \ncoworkers. The first letter indicated that Applicant was recognized as the employee of \nthe month during her first 90 days of employment and is trustworthy. Her program \nmanager believes she has dedication, character, and dependability required for the job. \nHer deputy program manager finds her character to be \u201cbeyond reproach.\u201d Her team \nlead believes Applicant to be honest, hardworking, and a motivated team player. \n(Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \nEvery CAC eligibility decision must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense \ndecision based on all available evidence, both favorable and unfavorable. The HSPD-12 \ncredentialing standards are listed in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 1, Basic \nAdjudicative Standards, and Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards. The \noverriding factor for all of these eligibility criteria is unacceptable risk.  \n \nThe objective of CAC credentialing process is the fair-minded commonsense \nassessment of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \n\n \n3 \nacceptable risk to have CAC eligibility. Each case must be judged on its own merits, \ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, \nmature thinking, and careful analysis.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain CAC eligibility.  \n \nFactors to be applied consistently to all information available include: (1) the \nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; \n(3) the recency and frequency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the \ntime of the conduct; (5) contributing external conditions; and (6) the absence or \npresence of efforts towards rehabilitation. (DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, paragraph 1.)  \n \nAnalysis \n \nSupplemental Adjudicative Standards, Paragraph 1.a \n \n \nDoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nexpresses concerns pertaining to misconduct or negligence in employment. Paragraph \n1 of this section states: \n \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s misconduct or negligence in \nemployment, that issuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.   \n \na. An individual\u2019s employment misconduct or negligence may \nput people, property, or information systems at risk. \n \n \nThe disqualifying condition set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, \nSubparagraph 1.b that is raised by Applicant\u2019s misconduct or negligence in employment \nis: \n \n(1) A previous history of intentional wrongdoing on the job, disruptive, \nviolent, or other acts that may pose an unacceptable risk to people, \nproperty, or information systems. \n \n \nApplicant was terminated because she stole from another employee in June \n2017. Her conduct raises a significant concern because it is disruptive to the workplace. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nPotentially mitigating conditions are set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \nAppendix 2, Subparagraph 1.c. The conditions that could apply to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the evidence in this case are: \n \n\n \n4 \n(1) The behavior happened so long ago, was minor, or happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current trustworthiness or good judgment relating \nto the safety of people and proper safeguarding of property and \ninformation systems; \n \n(2) The individual was not adequately warned that the conduct was \nunacceptable and could not reasonably be expected to know that the \nconduct was wrong; \n \n(3) The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the behavior; \nand \n \n(4) The individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial training \nand has since demonstrated a positive attitude toward the discharge of \ninformation-handling or security responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to take money from the purse of a coworker was recent and \nno unusual circumstances surrounding her theft have been documented. Her \nmisconduct casts doubt on her current trustworthiness or good judgment. While she has \nexpressed remorse for her conduct, and has demonstrated trustworthiness in her \ncurrent position, not enough time has passed since the theft to show rehabilitation, in \nlight of her falsification discussed below. The concern is not mitigated. \n \nSupplemental Adjudicative Standards, Paragraph 3.a \n \n \nDoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, Supplemental Adjudicative Standards \nexpresses concerns pertaining to misconduct or negligence in employment. Paragraph \n3 of this section states: \n \n \nA CAC will not be issued to a person if there is a reasonable basis to \nbelieve, based on the individual\u2019s material, intentional false statement, \ndeception, or fraud in connection with federal or contract employment, that \nissuance of a CAC poses an unacceptable risk.   \n \na. The individual\u2019s conduct involving questionable judgment, \nlack of candor, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nhonesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and put people, property, \nor information systems at risk. \n \nb. Therefore, conditions that may be disqualifying include \nmaterial, intentional falsification, deception or fraud related to \nanswers or information provided during the employment \nprocess for the current or a prior federal or contract \nemployment (e.g., on the employment application or other \n\n \n5 \nemployment, appointment or investigative documents, or \nduring interviews.) \n \n \nThe disqualifying conditions set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, Appendix 2, \nSubparagraph 3.b are raised by Applicant\u2019s falsification on her Declaration for Federal \nEmployment form (306), signed on September 26, 2017. She admitted her falsification \nin her Answer.  \n \n \nPotentially mitigating conditions are set forth in DoDI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, \nAppendix 2, Subparagraph 3.c. The conditions that could apply to mitigate the \nunacceptable risk concerns raised by the evidence in this case are: \n \n(1) The misstated or omitted information was so long ago, was minor, or \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur; \nand \n \n(2) The misstatement or omission was unintentional or inadvertent and \nwas followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above in Subparagraph 3.c, it \nis apparent that neither of them were established in this case. Applicant\u2019s falsification \nwas recent. Falsifying material information raises serious concerns and Applicant has \ndone little to show that similar dishonesty is unlikely to recur. While she has gained the \ntrust of her supervisors and coworkers, there is no evidence that the authors of the \nletters knew of the allegations on the SOR. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith \nefforts to correct her falsification and concealment. She has not provided sufficient \nevidence to meet her burden of proof to overcome her material, intentional false \nstatement in connection with her federal employment. \n \nFurther Mitigation \n \n \nDODI 5200.46, Enclosure 4, CAC Adjudicative Procedures, Paragraph 1, \nGuidance For Applying Credentialing Standards During Adjudication provides the \nfollowing: \n \na. As established in Reference (g), credentialing adjudication considers \nwhether or not an individual is eligible for long-term access to federally \ncontrolled facilities and/or information systems. The ultimate determination \nto authorize, deny, or revoke the CAC based on a credentialing \ndetermination of the PSI must be made after consideration of applicable \ncredentialing standards in Reference (c).  \n \nb. Each case is unique. Adjudicators must examine conditions that raise \nan adjudicative concern, the overriding factor for all of these conditions is \nunacceptable risk. Factors to be applied consistently to all information \navailable to the adjudicator are: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) The nature and seriousness of the conduct. The more serious \nthe conduct, the greater the potential for an adverse CAC determination. \n \n \n(2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct. Sufficient \ninformation concerning the circumstances of the conduct must be obtained \nto determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe the conduct \nposes a risk to people, property or information systems. \n \n \n(3) The recency and frequency of the conduct. More recent or more \nfrequent conduct is of greater concern.  \n \n \n(4) The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct. \nOffenses committed as a minor are usually treated as less serious than \nthe same offenses committed as an adult, unless the offense is very \nrecent, part of a pattern, or particularly heinous. \n \n \n(5) Contributing external conditions. Economic and cultural \nconditions may be relevant to the determination of whether there is a \nreasonable basis to believe there is an unacceptable risk if the conditions \nare currently removed or countered (generally considered in cases with \nrelatively minor issues). \n \n \n(6) The absence or presence of efforts toward rehabilitation, if \nrelevant, to address conduct adverse to CAC determinations. \n \n \n    (a) Clear, affirmative evidence of rehabilitation is required for a \nfavorable adjudication (e.g., seeking assistance and following professional \nguidance, where appropriate; demonstrating positive changes in behavior \nand employment). \n \n \n   (b) Rehabilitation may be a consideration for most conduct, not \njust alcohol and drug abuse. While formal counseling or treatment may be \na consideration, other factors (such as the individual\u2019s employment record) \nmay also be indications of rehabilitation. \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence of recent good character at her present employer \nincluding being awarded employee of the month. While she offered four letters of \nsupport, they failed to acknowledge they knew about her prior criminal conduct. Her \ntheft and her falsification were recent and material. She has not demonstrated she has \nthe requisite judgment to have CAC eligibility. There is a reasonable basis to conclude \nthat Applicant represents an unacceptable risk for the U.S. Government. Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for CAC eligibility is denied. \n \n\n \n7 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nSOR Paragraph 1:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSOR Paragraph 2:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is an \nunacceptable risk to grant Applicant CAC eligibility. CAC eligibility is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On March 5, 2018, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, with attachments, on April 5, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to \n \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nproceed on May 11, 2018. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on \nJune 15, 2018. It was then assigned to a second administrative judge on July 5, 2018. \nThe case was reassigned to me on July 10, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 5, 2018, scheduling the hearing for \nAugust 20, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through BB, which were \nalso admitted without objection. The record remained open until September 14, 2018, at \nApplicant\u2019s request for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant submitted \nApplicant Exhibits CC through EE in a timely manner, which were also admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 29, 2018. \n \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant is 38 years old. He married his second wife in September 2017. They \nhave two children, and he has two children from his first marriage. Applicant was married \nto his first wife from 2006 until March 2017, though the parties separated in May 2012. \nHe has received both a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Science degree. He \nhas worked for his current employer since 2006 and wishes to retain national security \neligibility for a security clearance in connection with that employment. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 17; Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 22-25.)  \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q. He denied SOR allegations 1.m \nand 1.n. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part the debts set forth in SOR \nallegations 1.b through 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o. The existence and amounts of all of the debts \nare set forth in credit bureau reports dated July 26, 2016; and May 11, 2018. (Government \nExhibits 5 and 6.)   \n \n \nApplicant argued that a long and arduous divorce proceeding from his now ex-wife \nwas the primary cause of all of his financial issues. According to Applicant, he had to pay \nexcessive spouse and child support, as well as his ex-wife\u2019s attorney fees. Eventually, he \nwas unable to maintain payments on his debts. Only recently has he been able to begin \nto resolve his debts. (Applicant Exhibits G, H, and K; Tr. 26-29, 59-62.) \n \n \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed several unpaid student loans, as set forth in \nthis allegation and SOR allegation 1.j. Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement \nconcerning all of his student loans, totaling approximately $61,646. Beginning in March \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n2018, Applicant began making monthly payments of $240 a month. Applicant had made \nseven payments as of the date the record closed. Once he has made nine payments in \nten months, his loans will be taken out of default status and then regular payments can \nbegin. His actions are sufficient to show a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt \nis being resolved through agreed payments. (Applicant Exhibits V and L; Tr. 28-34, 79-\n80, 88-89.)  \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $15,958 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 34-36, 39-40, 81-83; Applicant \nExhibit BB.)  \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $3,245 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness.

One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 38-40, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.)   \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,889 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 39-40, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.) \n \n \n1.e Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,701 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record, and that he had not made \nany payments towards it. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company \non August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness. The \nagreement posits that Applicant will make monthly payments of $290, out of which the \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \ndebt relief company will attempt to make payment arrangements with his creditors. \nApplicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, which is the only one before the \nrecord closed. One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 39-41, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,012 for a past-\ndue credit card bill. Applicant admitted to this allegation on the record. Applicant entered \ninto an agreement with a debt relief company on August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve \nthis and other past-due indebtedness. The agreement posits that Applicant will make \nmonthly payments of $290, out of which the debt relief company will attempt to make \npayment arrangements with his creditors. Applicant made his first payment on September \n7, 2018, which is the only one before the record closed. One payment is insufficient to \nshow that Applicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. 39-41, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit BB.) \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $695 for a past-due \ncredit card bill. He admitted to this allegation on the record. Pursuant to a motion from the \nGovernment, and in accordance with the evidence, the SOR was amended to show the \ntrue amount owed as $6,214 in accordance with Directive, Additional Procedural \nGuidance \u00b6 E3.1.17. Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt relief company on \nAugust 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and other past-due indebtedness.

One payment is insufficient to show that Applicant has made a good-faith \neffort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 39-42, 81-87; Applicant Exhibit \nBB.) \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a utility company \n$241 for a past-due debt. Based on the available evidence I find that Applicant owed this \ndebt. Applicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing and had no current \nplans to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 42-44; Government Exhibit 6.) \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a utility company \n$125 for a past-due debt. Based on the available evidence I find that Applicant owed this \ndebt. Applicant had not paid this debt as of the date of the hearing and had no current \nplans to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 44; Government Exhibit 6.) \n \n \n1.j. Applicant admitted that he owed several unpaid student loans, as set forth in \nthis allegation and SOR allegation 1.a. Applicant entered into a rehabilitation agreement \nconcerning all of his student loans, totaling approximately $61,646. Beginning in March \n2018, Applicant began making monthly payments of $240 a month. Applicant had made \nseven payments as of the date the record closed. Once he has made nine payments in \nten months, his loans will be taken out of default status and then regular payments can \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nbegin. His actions are sufficient to show a good faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt \nis being resolved through agreed payments. (Applicant Exhibits V and L; Tr. 28-34, 79-\n80, 88-89.) \n \n \n1.k. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed $2,451 for a past-\ndue debt. He admitted to this allegation on the record. Applicant entered into an \nagreement with a debt relief company on August 16, 2018, to attempt to resolve this and \nother past-due indebtedness. The agreement posits that Applicant will make monthly \npayments of $290, out of which the debt relief company will attempt to make payment \narrangements with his creditors. Applicant made his first payment on September 7, 2018, \nwhich is the only one before the record closed. One payment is insufficient to show that \nApplicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. \n39-41, 44-45, 81-83; Applicant Exhibit BB.) \n \n \n1.l. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a cable company \n$284 for a past-due debt. Applicant retained a credit repair company, which successfully \ndisputed this debt and had it removed from his credit reports. The debt is not on the most \nrecent credit reports in the record provided by the Government and Applicant. It has been \nresolved. (Government Exhibit 6; Applicant Exhibits O, W and AA; Tr. 45-46.) \n \n \n1.m. Applicant denied that he owed a creditor $279 for a past-due debt. Applicant \nretained a credit repair company, which successfully disputed this debt and had it \nremoved from his credit reports. The debt is not on the most recent credit reports in the \nrecord provided by the Government and Applicant. It has been resolved. (Government \nExhibit 6; Applicant Exhibits O, W and AA; Tr. 46-47.) \n \n \n1.n. Applicant denied that he owed a medical creditor $115 for a past-due debt. \nApplicant retained a credit repair company, which disputed this debt. The debt was \nverified by the creditor as a valid debt. Applicant had not paid this debt or made \narrangements to resolve it. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibits O, W and AA; Tr. 47-48.) \n \n \n1.o. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part that he owed a medical creditor \n$44 for a past-due debt. Applicant retained a credit repair company, which disputed this \ndebt. The debt was verified by the creditor as a valid debt. Applicant had not paid this \ndebt or made arrangements to resolve it. It is not resolved. (Applicant Exhibits O, W and \nAA; Tr. 48.) \n \n \n1.p. Applicant admitted that he did not file his Federal tax returns in a timely fashion \nfor the 2013, 2015, and 2016 tax years. Applicant stated that he could not file his tax \nreturns because he lacked essential information concerning child and spousal support \nduring his divorce, as well as other essential financial information. Applicant further stated \nthat he had filed all of his Federal tax returns. Evidence was submitted showing the \nsuccessful filing of his 2013 and 2015 tax returns in March 2018, and that Applicant had \nattempted to file his 2016 tax return at the same time. Applicant does not owe any back \ntaxes. (Tr. 48-52, 63-72; Applicant Exhibits I, J, Y, Z, and EE.) \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n1.q. Applicant admitted that he did not file his state tax returns in a timely fashion \nfor the 2013, 2015, and 2016 tax years. Applicant stated that he could not file his tax \nreturns because he lacked essential information concerning child and spousal support \nduring his divorce. Applicant further stated that he had filed all of his state tax returns in \napproximately March 2018. Evidence was submitted showing that all of the tax returns in \nissue had been filed with his state taxing authority. Applicant does not owe any back \ntaxes. (Tr. 48-52, 72; Applicant Exhibits I and DD.) \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant has had a successful career. Several co-workers, including supervisors, \nrecommend him for a position of trust. He is described as a person who is \u201cethical,\u201d \n\u201creliable,\u201d and \u201cdependable.\u201d The most recent performance appraisal in the record shows \nthat he \u201cMeets Job Requirements.\u201d (Applicant Exhibits A and F.) \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state tax returns, as required, for at least \nthree years. In addition, there are substantial past-due debts, including student loans. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s substantial financial issues, including failure to \ntimely file tax returns and unpaid bills: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s past-due indebtedness. Two of the debts were \nsuccessfully disputed by Applicant (1.l and 1.m). Those allegations are found for him. In \naddition, he has shown a good-faith effort to resolve his past-due student loans (1.a and \n1.j.) Those allegations are found for him. \n \n Applicant\u2019s past-due debts are long-standing, and he continues to be heavily \nindebted. He still owes approximately $36,000. Mitigating condition \u00b6 20(a) does not apply \nto his remaining unresolved delinquencies. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long divorce undoubtedly had a serious impact on his ability to resolve \nhis debts. However, entering into a debt relief program literally at the 11th hour, with only \none payment made after the date of the hearing, does not show he has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Mitigating condition \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts that he owed, and his debt relief program \nhad barely started as of the date the record closed. Accordingly, while Applicant may have \ninitiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts, it cannot be said that he is adhering to it, \nor that there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \nMitigating conditions \u00b6 20(c) and (d) do not apply, except to his student loan debt. \n \nApplicant successfully disputed two of the debts. Mitigating condition \u00b620(e) \napplies to those two debts only. \n \nFinally, with regard to his taxes, Applicant submitted evidence that he has filed, \nalbeit late, all of his past-due tax returns. It is obvious that his divorce impacted his ability \nto properly file his taxes. Under the unique circumstances of this case, particularly since \nApplicant does not owe back taxes, SOR allegations 1.p and 1.q are found for Applicant.  \n \nAs stated, SOR allegations 1.a, j, l, and m are also found for Applicant. With those \nexceptions, Applicant did not mitigate his financial issues. Guideline F is found against \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nsufficient evidence to show that the majority of his unpaid debts had been responsibly \naddressed, or were being resolved. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress \nremains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a security clearance. He failed to meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n      \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l through 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n through 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.p through 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant was counseled approximately 40 times between January 2012 and March \n2017 in the U.S. military for failure to comply with a lawful order and tardiness. He used \nmarijuana with a state-issued medical marijuana card approximately five times in June \n2017 and tested positive for marijuana in a drug screen in July 2017. Applicant improved \nhis military conduct over time to conform his duty performance to expectations, and he has \nnot had misconduct issues in his present job. He destroyed his medical marijuana card and \nintends to refrain from any involvement with marijuana in the future. Clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 26, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline E, personal conduct, and \nexplaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \n12/26/2018\n\n2 \n \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \nOn May 9, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn September 7, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On October 5, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for November 15, \n2018. \n \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were \nadmitted in evidence. An August 1, 2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant \nand a list of the GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I and II) for the record but not \nadmitted in evidence. Three Applicant exhibits (AEs A-C) were admitted in evidence. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 27, 2018. I held \nthe record open for three weeks after the hearing for additional evidence from Applicant. \nOn December 5, 2018, Applicant submitted a copy of his medical marijuana card, which \nwas admitted into evidence as AE D without objection. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H, and cross-alleges under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 \n2.b) that Applicant used and purchased marijuana in approximately June 2017 while he \nwas granted access to classified information (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that Applicant tested positive \nfor marijuana in July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant is also alleged under Guideline E to have \nreceived approximately 40 corrective action memos or written reprimands between July \n2011 and March 2017 for misconduct issues while he was serving on active duty in the \nU.S. military (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \n \n \nIn a detailed response of May 9, 2018, Applicant admitted the use of marijuana with \na legally obtained medical marijuana card and that he had failed a pre-employment drug \nscreen administered by his current employer. Having learned that even medical marijuana \nuse was illegal under federal law, he destroyed his marijuana card and had himself \nremoved from the medical marijuana program. Applicant also admitted the disciplinary \nactions taken against him during his active duty service, with over half of them received \nduring his first two years, for conduct that he attributes to being \u201ca loud-mouthed know it all \nthat didn\u2019t want to listen to anybody of authority and challenged everybody.\u201d Applicant \nexplained that after he attained the rank of petty officer third class (E-4), his command had \na serious talk with him about his performance and professionalism, and that written \nreprimands were few and far between thereafter. He added that such conduct had not \ncontinued in his current employment; that he had received a raise; and that he has been \napproached about a career development plan at work. (Answer.) \n\n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old high school graduate with some community college \ncredits. He was married from January 2013 to March 2016, and has a five-year-old son for \nwhom he pays $650 per month in child support. His ex-wife has primary physical custody of \ntheir son. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 24-26.) He has worked for his current defense contractor employer \nas a test mechanic since July 2017 and needs to retain his security clearance to maintain \nhis employment. (Tr. 25.) \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. military with a Secret security clearance \nfrom July 2011 to March 2017. (GE 1.) After completing boot camp and military schooling, \nApplicant reported to a command in January 2012. He initially showed little appreciation for \nmilitary decorum or rank and challenged his superiors about military practices and \nregulations. He was also late to watch on occasion. He was issued well over 20 corrective \naction memoranda or written reprimands during his first two years in the service. In 2014, \nhe achieved the rank of petty officer third class. After being counseled about his lack of \nmilitary professionalism and insubordinate attitude, he began to conform his behavior to \nthat expected of his rank and military service. (GE 2; Tr. 54-55, 62-67.) His Evaluation \nReport and Counseling Record for his duty performance from June 2015 to June 2016 \nindicates that he exceeded standards in areas of military bearing/character, personal job \naccomplishments, and teamwork. Applicant\u2019s rating superior noted that Applicant had \nshown improvement over the reporting period and was now operating at the level expected \nin his division. He was described as knowledgeable, a team player, and driven and \nrecommended for advancement with a rating of must promote. (AE A.) \n \nCounseling incidents declined significantly, although by the time of his discharge, \nApplicant estimated that he had received approximately 40 written chits or reprimands at \nthe command. (GE 2.) Applicant was administered non-judicial punishment once, in \nDecember 2016, when he and three others violated liberty restrictions by staying out past \ncurfew. Applicant was punished with a reduction in rank from E-4 to E-3 (suspended), 60 \ndays restriction (suspended), and loss of half pay for two months (enforced) for failure to \nobey an order and conduct that could bring discredit on the armed forces. Applicant was \nwarned that the reduction in rank and restriction punishments would be enforced if he \nshould receive any additional written counseling chits or reprimands. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 57, 67.) \n \nWithin a month of his non-judicial proceeding, Applicant had an argument with an \ninformation technology systems technician in his division. A week later, the technician \nblamed Applicant for cutting an Internet cable.1 Applicant was issued a written counseling \n                                                 \n1 Applicant indicated during a December 2017 subject interview that he argued with the information technology \nsystems technician because the technician was not permitted to be present during weapons handling, and he \nrefused to leave until a superior intervened. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that he argued with the technician \nbecause his son had just been diagnosed with autism, and the technician had blocked his emails so he could \nnot receive updates about his son. (Tr. 63-63.) \n\n4 \n \nchit, even though he denied cutting the cable and never signed the chit. As a result of the \nreprimand, the suspended terms of his non-judicial punishment were imposed. Applicant \ncontested the reprimand to no avail. According to Applicant, when he asked a military \nsuperior for assistance, this superior told him that he had to worry about his own career. \n(Tr. 62.) Because of his length of service, Applicant could not continue in the military at the \nrank of E-3 per regulation. In March 2017, he was honorably discharged against his desire \nto stay in the military. (GE 2; Tr. 24, 58-64.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct superior at the time of Applicant\u2019s non-judicial punishment and \ndischarge had served with Applicant from January 2013. He attests that early on, Applicant \nfrequently disappeared and was delinquent in his qualifications. However, once Applicant \ndecided to commit to his duty, his performance improved markedly, and he took immense \npride in his work.  Applicant proved to be a great asset to him with training junior personnel \nand could be counted on to give his very best until the job was done. (AE B.) \n \nTwo or three weeks after his discharge from the military, Applicant applied to work \nfor his current employer. (Tr. 28.) As of May 2017, he had received no response to his job \napplication. (Tr. 21, 29.) He had trouble sleeping, and expressed his concerns to a \ncounselor who was seeing a friend. The counselor suggested that he see a local physician \nfor medical marijuana. Applicant had used marijuana twice that he can recall and perhaps \nthree to four times while in high school \u201cto party,\u201d but he did not engage in any illegal drug \nuse while in the military. (Tr. 26-27, 50-51.)The physician prescribed medical marijuana for \nApplicant for post-traumatic stress related to his military service.2 (GE 2; Tr. 35, 40-41, 47.) \nOn May 25, 2017, Applicant was certified for medical marijuana by the state for one year. \nHe was authorized to purchase 2.5 ounces from a medical marijuana dispensary. He \nreceived his card (AE D) in the mail a few weeks later, and he purchased 3.5 grams of \nmarijuana from a dispensary at a cost of $35. (GE 2; Tr. 41-42.) Applicant used marijuana \napproximately five times over the course of two or three days in his home in June 2017. \n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 42-43.) He did not share any of the marijuana because it would be a criminal \noffense. (Tr. 42.) Applicant did not then consider the implications of his medical marijuana \nuse because it was legal under state law. (Tr. 23, 45.) \n \n \nShortly after he used marijuana, Applicant was offered a position with his employer. \nHe realized that his use of marijuana could have negative implications. He discarded his \nmedical marijuana card and removed himself from the medical marijuana program.3 (Tr. \n32-33.) He was called in to the worksite by his employer in July 2017 and administered a \n                                                                                                                                                             \n  \n2 Under pertinent state law, a patient may only register for a medical marijuana certificate if he or she is a state \nresident being treated for a debilitating medical condition by a state-licensed physician. Post-traumatic stress \ndisorder is one of the specific debilitating conditions that qualifies for medical marijuana under state law. \n \n3 Applicant told the OPM investigator that he stopped using marijuana immediately when he received his job \noffer. (GE 2.) Applicant was asked on cross-examination about when he stopped using marijuana. He testified \nthat he was \u201calready done and out,\u201d when he was called by his employer. When asked when he first suspected \nthat his marijuana use could be a problem, he responded that his mind set was that marijuana was legal in the \nstate and he \u201cdidn\u2019t make the correlation between state and federal.\u201d He acknowledged that he realized it \ncould be problematic. (Tr.  44-45.) Applicant testified that he destroyed his medical marijuana card to \u201ctake \naway all temptation,\u201d and so there would be no doubt that he could use marijuana again. (Tr. 32.) \n\n5 \n \npre-employment drug screen by hair sample. (GE 3; Tr. 29-30.) Suspecting that he would \ntest positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), Applicant notified the person taking his \nsample that he had a medical marijuana card, and he provided proof to the yard hospital by \nemail link that he had been issued a state medical marijuana certificate. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 31-\n33.) On July 19, 2017, Applicant\u2019s employer filed an incident report with the DOD indicating \nthat Applicant had tested positive for THC in his pre-employment hair drug screen, and that \nhe had provided proof of a state medical marijuana certificate to the yard hospital. (GE 3.) \n \n \nDespite failing the pre-employment drug screen, Applicant was hired by the defense \ncontractor because his marijuana use was legal under state law. Applicant was told that he \ncould no longer use any marijuana legally or illegally because it was a federal contractor \njob and marijuana is illegal under federal law. (Tr. 22, 35.) \n \n \nOn July 27, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to inquiries concerning \nthe illegal use of drugs or controlled substances, Applicant indicated that he used medical \nmarijuana with a medical marijuana card one day throughout the day in June 2017. He \ndenied any intention to use marijuana in the future and explained: \n \nI had a [state] Medical Marijuana card. Legal by state ILLEGAL by federal \nlaw. Since working at [company] I have stopped use and have also destroyed \nthe card and taken measures to remove myself from the program. (GE 1.) \n \nIn early December 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He volunteered that, when he was in the \nmilitary, he had been disciplined an estimated 40 times for misconduct related to \ndisrespecting rank and military decorum (such as asking a superior not to walk on the deck \nthat he had just cleaned; requesting gloves before he would clean latrines; and asking a \nsuperior not to stick his finger in his face). He often challenged his superiors, for which he \nreceived counseling chits for insubordination. He was also written up multiple times for \nbeing late to watch and once for breaking a window in a guard shack. He explained that he \noften spoke up when he felt something was not right or he felt a superior was being \ndemeaning toward him. Applicant addressed his non-judicial punishment and the \nsubsequent incident involving the Internet cable that led to his discharge. He denied that he \ncut the cable and indicated that the technician who issued the chit admitted to an officer \nthat he wrote the chit out of anger following his argument with Applicant. Applicant \nacknowledged that he had created a bad reputation among his superiors at the command, \nbut his performance evaluations were generally good, even with all the written counseling \nmemoranda. About his marijuana use, Applicant explained that he purchased 3.5 grams of \nmarijuana with a medical marijuana card in June 2017 and used it \u201cno more than five \ntimes.\u201d Later that month, he received a job offer from his defense-contractor employer, and \nhe immediately resolved to abstain from any marijuana use in the future. He added that he \nfailed his initial drug screen administered by the company and notified company personnel \nabout his medical marijuana use. He indicated that, because he had a medical marijuana \ncard, he could work for the company but would have to update his security clearance \npaperwork and abstain from marijuana going forward. Applicant denied any use of \n\n6 \n \nmarijuana since then and added that he had destroyed his medical marijuana card. \nApplicant explained that he would not compromise his employment eligibility by using \nmarijuana in the future. He agreed to submit to random drug screening by his employer. \n(GE 2.) \n \nIn September or October 2017, Applicant volunteered for a drug screen at work that \nwas negative for all substances tested, including marijuana. (Tr. 35-36.) Applicant \nunderstands that his employer has a drug-free policy (Tr. 28, 36), and that marijuana \nremains illegal under federal law. (Tr. 52.) He signed an agreement with his employer to \nrefrain from engaging in any prohibited drug use while employed by the company. He has \nbeen tasked by his employer with talking to new hires now and then about the fact that \nemployees have to abide by the federal prohibition of any marijuana involvement. (Tr. 53-\n54.) Applicant does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 35.) He now takes \nmelatonin to help with his sleep issues. (Tr. 39.) \n \nApplicant has not had any incidents of misconduct or insubordination in his current \njob. (Tr. 72.) He was promoted after six months on the job and has applied for a \nsupervisory position. (Tr. 68.)  He only recently regained his driving privileges, which had \nbeen suspended when he was in the military because his ex-wife failed to pay a speeding \nticket for him that he incurred just prior to a deployment. He had to take Uber to work at   \n$36 a day that he paid for by working overtime. (Tr. 69-71.)  Applicant\u2019s current supervisor \nasks that Applicant be given special consideration by the DOD with respect to keeping his \nclearance. Applicant has become a valuable asset to their department. He qualified to hold \ntwo positions centered on the safety and well-being of workers and needs no guidance. His \nsupervisor considers Applicant to be an \u201cextremely efficient, driven, competent and \nqualified individual.\u201d (AE C.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant used medical marijuana approximately five times over two to three days in \nJune 2017. He used and purchased the drug with a medical marijuana card obtained \nlegally in his state.4 That marijuana use caused him to fail a pre-employment drug screen \n                                                 \n4 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I drug. Despite some states providing for medical marijuana use or the \ndecriminalization or legalization of recreational use of minor amounts of the drug, marijuana remains a \n\n8 \n \nadministered by his employer in July 2017. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany \nsubstance misuse (see above definition);\u201d 25(b), \u201ctesting positive for an illegal drug;\u201d and \n25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\u201d apply. \nThe Government\u2019s case for AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position,\u201d inferentially stems from the fact that \nApplicant held a Secret clearance for his military duties that had not been revoked or \nsuspended after his discharge in March 2017.5 His break in service was only a few months, \nand so his clearance was still active. He had applied to work for a defense contractor for \nwhich he needed to retain his Secret clearance eligibility. To the extent that AG \u00b6 25(f) \napplies, it must be noted that Applicant was not in a position when he used the marijuana \nwhere he could potentially have been exposed to classified or sensitive information.  \n \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. Two \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have some applicability. They provide: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all illegal drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n                                                                                                                                                             \nSchedule I controlled substance under federal law. Such drugs have a high potential for abuse, no currently \naccepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and lack accepted safety for using the drug under \nmedical supervision. \n  \n5 DoD 5220.22, the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual, provides for reciprocity under \u00b6 2-\n204: \n \nFederal agencies that grant access to classified information to their employees or their \ncontractor employees are responsible for determining whether such employees have been \npreviously cleared or investigated by the Federal Government. Any previously granted \n[Personnel Security Clearance] that is based upon a current investigation of a scope that \nmeets or exceeds that necessary for the clearance required shall provide the basis for \nissuance of a new clearance without further investigation or adjudication unless significant \nderogatory information that was not previously adjudicated becomes known to the granting \nagency. \n \nUnder \u00b6 2-201 of the NISPOM, investigations are current if within five years and meet the standards for the \nlevel of personnel security clearance required. \n\n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was infrequent and legal under state law. He apparently \ndid not fully understand that his state laws permitting medical marijuana do not alter the \nfederal prohibition or existing national security guidelines concerning marijuana use. Even \nso, the circumstances of his use are somewhat troubling because he had an application \npending to work for his employer in a position needing security clearance eligibility, and he \nheld eligibility for a Secret clearance that may well have been a consideration in the \nemployer\u2019s decision to hire him. There is no evidence that his clearance had been revoked, \neven though he was unemployed and not accessing classified information. Applicant knew \nwhen he was in the military that marijuana use was prohibited and illegal under federal law \nif not also contrary to his security clearance eligibility. His security clearance eligibility \nshould have given him reason to question whether he should use medical marijuana \nirrespective of state law and of the fact that he had not received a response from the \ndefense contractor to his job application. AG \u00b6 25(a) does not fully apply. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 25(b), Applicant has persuasively established that he does not \nintend to use any marijuana in the future. Regarding when he decided he was done with \nmarijuana, he told an OPM investigator that, when notified of a job offer from his employer \nlater in June 2017, he immediately stopped using medical marijuana. He testified at his \nhearing that he was \u201calready done and out\u201d before he was contacted. Suspecting that his \ndrug screen would be positive, Applicant destroyed his medical marijuana card to \u201ctake \naway all temptation,\u201d and so there would be no doubt that he could use marijuana again. \nHe indicated on his SF 86, during his subject interview, and again during his hearing that \nhe does not intend to use marijuana again because it is illegal under federal law, and he \ndoes not want to jeopardize his job. His dedication to his work, which was confirmed by his \ncurrent supervisor, reflects the importance of his job to him. He is not likely to risk his \nemployment by using marijuana. As of his hearing, he had not used marijuana in 15 \nmonths, and so has established a pattern of abstinence under AG \u00b6 25(b). Although he has \nnot executed a statement of intention to abstain containing an acknowledgement that any \nfuture involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of his security clearance, he \nsigned a statement for his employer that he would not use any marijuana while employed \nby the company. His drug involvement and substance misuse is mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n25(b). \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \n  \nThe concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15:  \n  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \n \n\n10 \n \nApplicant volunteered during his subject interview that he had a difficult time \nadjusting to the military after he reported to a command in January 2012. For \ninsubordination, disrespect of rank and military decorum, and being late to watch several \ntimes, he was written up approximately 40 times by his superiors at the command, with \nmost of the discipline imposed during his first two years. After being counseled about his \nlack of military professionalism and insubordinate attitude, he began to conform his \nbehavior to that expected of his rank and military service. He showed notable improvement \nover the June 2015 to June 2016 rating period to the point where he exceeded standards \nin areas of military bearing/character, personal job accomplishments, and teamwork. Even \nso, he received his only non-judicial punishment during his military service in December \n2012 for violating curfew restrictions while out with other servicemen. He subsequently \nreceived another counseling chit from an information technology technician for allegedly \ncutting an Internet cable. Applicant denied that he cut the cable, but whether because of \nhis poor reputation earned early at the command or because he had been warned to avoid \nany further infractions, it was enough for his commanding officer to impose the sanctions \n(restriction and reduction in rank) that had been suspended in December 2012. The record \ndoes not fully spell out with specificity the nature and dates of many of Applicant\u2019s \ndisciplinary infractions. Even so, his admitted misconduct is enough to satisfy disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 16(d), which provides: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself of an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \nConcerning the Government\u2019s case for disqualification under the personal conduct \nguideline because of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use while he held an active security clearance \nand Applicant\u2019s drug screen positive for marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b), the Appeal Board has held \nthat security-related conduct can be considered under more than one guideline, and in an \nappropriate case, be given independent weight under each. See ISCR Case No. 11-06672 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2012). Applicant exercised \u201cquestionable judgment\u201d within the general \nsecurity concerns set forth in AG \u00b6 15 when he used and purchased marijuana in violation \nof the obligations of his security clearance eligibility. Separate from the risk of physiological \nimpairment associated with the use of a mood-altering substance, which is a Guideline H \nconcern, Applicant had an obligation as a clearance holder to comply with federal law. \n \nTwo of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 merit some consideration. They are \nas follows: \n\n11 \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factor that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \n  \nDespite the numerous disciplinary actions, steps were not taken to separate \nApplicant from the military until March 2017 when he was granted an honorable discharge. \nThis suggests that his violations were largely minor in nature, but they cannot be \nreasonably characterized as infrequent. Although his medical marijuana use was limited, \nthe fact that he held security clearance eligibility and had an application pending for \ndefense-contractor employment when he used the marijuana is an aggravating factor. His \nmarijuana use when combined with his record of misconduct in the military supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment that is not adequately mitigated by AG \n\u00b6 17(c). \n \nFor the reasons discussed under Guideline H, Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is not likely \nto recur. Regarding his disciplinary infractions in the military, Applicant should have \nunderstood by December 2016 what the command expected of him. He was an E-4 who \nhad considerable responsibilities and had gone a long way toward rehabilitating his \nreputation in the command. He had everything to lose and nothing to gain by violating \ncurfew. He was given yet another chance by the command with the suspension of the \nimposition of reduction in rank. He was on notice by his command that another counseling \nchit would result in the imposition of suspended punishments. Applicant thereafter argued \nwith a technician, who filed a counseling chit alleging that Applicant cut an Internet cable. \nThere is no evidence to rebut Applicant\u2019s assertion that he did not cut the cable. Whether \nor not the technician filed a false reprimand, Applicant bears some responsibility for the \nend of his military career. Even so, to the extent that Applicant\u2019s disciplinary infractions \nhave some bearing on his current security worthiness, he has not displayed similar \nbehavior in his defense-contractor employment. Applicant has demonstrated sufficient \nreform for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d).   \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).6 In that regard, Applicant\u2019s youth likely played a role in his insubordination and other \n                                                 \n6 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n\n12 \n \nmisconduct in the military. He turned age 20 shortly before he reported to the command. \nWith none of the written reprimands in evidence, the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct cannot be fully determined.  Even if some of the corrective actions were not \nmerited, Applicant readily acknowledges that he was a hard-headed person who thought \nhe knew it all.  Applicant\u2019s medical marijuana use is exacerbated because it occurred while \nhe held an active clearance, although the legality of that use under state law is \ncircumstance that caused some confusion for him. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). At the same time, \nthe security clearance decision is not intended to punish applicants for past wrongdoing. \nRather, it involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness \nin light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. \nJune 21, 2010.) Applicant has exhibited reform and permanent behavioral change under \nAG \u00b6 2(d)(7). He began by learning to comport his duty performance to that expected by \nhis command. His military performance evaluation for June 2015 to June 2016 reflects the \nconsiderable progress he made in that regard. More recently, when he suspected that he \nwould test positive because of medical marijuana, he removed himself from the state\u2019s \nmedical marijuana program and destroyed his card. He has displayed reliability and \ndedication in his current job with no incidents of misconduct. His supervisor considers him \na valuable asset to their department. There is no evidence that Applicant ever violated \nsecurity either in the military or in his defense-contractor employment. He understands that \nany future drug involvement could cost him his employment that he clearly enjoys and \nwants to retain. While his repeated misconduct in the military and his June 2017 drug \ninvolvement are not condoned, I am persuaded they are not likely to reoccur. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n                                                                                                                                                             \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n13 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He mitigated \nforeign influence security concerns relating to his connections to Iraq. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nOn September 7, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On April 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February \n20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.   \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \n04/04/2019\n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under the foreign influence guideline.  \n \nApplicant provided an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 3) On February 7, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On \nFebruary 26, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 4, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant waived his \nright to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of his hearing, and his hearing \nwas held as scheduled. (Transcript (Tr.) 13)   \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, there were no \nobjections; and all of Department Counsel\u2019s proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 16-18, 46-47; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4) On March 13, 2019, I \nreceived the transcript of the hearing.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq. Applicant \ndid not object to me taking administrative notice of facts concerning Iraq, and I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 18-19) Department Counsel and Applicant indicated \nthey had no objection to me taking administrative notice of facts from the U.S. \nDepartment of State website concerning Iraq.1 (Tr. 18-19) Administrative or official \nnotice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR \nCase No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \n \nPortions of the Department Counsel\u2019s requests are quoted without quotation \nmarks and footnotes in the Iraq section of this decision, infra. The first two paragraphs \nand the last paragraph in the Iraq section are from the State Department website U.S. \nRelations with Iraq Fact Sheet, and the remainder is from Department Counsel\u2019s \nadministrative notice request.   \n                                            \n1 The first two paragraphs and the last paragraph in the Iraq section of this decision are from the \nU.S. Department of State website, \u201cU.S. Relations With Iraq Fact Sheet,\u201d Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs \n(Apr. 28, 2017), https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6804.htm. Statements about the United States\u2019 \nrelationship with Iraq from the Department of State are admissible. See ISCR Case No. 02-00318 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004). \n \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s spouse, parents-in-law, and brother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some \nclarifications. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 28 years old, and he is sponsored by a DOD contractor to become a \nlinguist for employment in Iraq or Kuwait. (Tr. 6, 30-32) In 2011, he graduated from high \nschool in the United States. (Tr. 6) He has two years of college. (Tr. 6) He has not \nserved in the military of any foreign country. (Tr. 7)  \n \nIn June 2016, Applicant married, and in September 2018, his spouse immigrated \nto the United States. (Tr. 7, 26-27) She is a permanent resident of the United States. \n(Tr. 8, 47) She has a degree from a university in Iraq in civil engineering. (Tr. 28) He \ndoes not have any children. (Tr. 8) Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq. (Tr. 29-30; SOR response) Applicant rarely \ncommunicates with his in-laws in Iraq; however, his spouse communicates with them \nabout three times a week. (Tr. 29-30)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father supported U.S. goals in Iraq against terrorists and insurgents. \n(Tr. 22-23) In 2006, Applicant\u2019s father fled from Iraq to Syria with his spouse and \nchildren because his father was concerned about the safety of his family. (Tr. 15, 23-24) \nIn 2008, Applicant, his father, mother, and siblings immigrated to the United States as \npolitical refugees. (Tr. 15, 24) In 2014, Applicant\u2019s parents, three sisters, and Applicant \nbecame U.S. citizens, and they are all residents of the United States. (Tr. 25, 29) \nApplicant\u2019s father\u2019s relatives who have remained in Iraq do not work for the Iraqi \nGovernment. (Tr. 33) Applicant does not own property in Iraq. (Tr. 33-34) He plans to \nbuy a home in the United States in 2019. (Tr. 34) One of Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s brothers \nlives in the United States. (Tr. 43) \n \nIn the last five years, Applicant traveled to Iraq five times. (Tr. 40) Now that his \nspouse is in the United States, he does not plan to travel to Iraq in the future, except \npossibly as a linguist. (Tr. 36) He is willing to renounce his Iraqi citizenship. (Tr. 39)3 In \n2014, he took the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America (GE \n2), which states: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \n                                            \n2 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. \n \n3 The Iraqi Council of the Presidency issued Article 10(I), which states, \u201cAn Iraqi who acquires a \nforeign nationality shall retain his Iraqi nationality, unless he has declared in writing renunciation of his \nIraqi nationality.\u201d Iraqi Official Gazette Issue 4019 dated March 7, 2006, No. 26, https://www.refworld.org/ \npdfid/4b1e364c2.pdf. \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.4 \n \nIraq \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with \nIraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of most U.S. troops from Iraq \nmarked a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, \nstable, and self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the United States in the \nregion as well as a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has \nfunctioning government institutions including an active legislature, is playing an \nincreasingly constructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil \nrevenues surpass pre-Saddam production levels with continued growth to come. The \nUnited States maintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, \npolitical, economic, and security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic \nFramework Agreement (SFA). \n \nThe U.S.-Iraq SFA provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It \ncovers the range of bilateral issues including political relations and diplomacy, defense \nand security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, \nscience, culture, education, and environment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen \nby several committees, which meet periodically. \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current \ntravel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by IEDs occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Methods of \nattack have included explosively formed penetrators (EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on \nvehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed near roads, \nmortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may \ntake place in public venues such as cafes and markets.  \n \n                                            \n4 The language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal Regulations \nSection 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and \nNationality Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448, https://www.uscis.gov/us-\ncitizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-states-america. \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \nIraq continues to be subjected to terrorist activity. ISIL\u2019s capacity and territorial \ncontrol in Iraq has dramatically eroded in the past two years. According to estimates from \nthe UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 \ncivilians and injured more than 12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces \nhad liberated all territory from ISIL, drastically reducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses \nand atrocities. Human rights violations continue to be a problem with allegations of \nunlawful killings and other abuses being made against the Iraqi Security Forces and \nPopular Mobilization Forces. Iran continues to seek influence and oppose the U.S. goals \nin Iraq.  \n \nHuman rights problems continue to occur, including sectarian hostility, corruption, \nand lack of transparency at all levels of government and society. These problems \nweakened the government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nIraqi Security Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed \nsome human rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization \nForces killing, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians.  \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; limits on freedom of expression, including press \nfreedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue censorship; social, \nreligious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; limits on freedoms of \npeaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due to violence by \nextremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement including on refugees and \ninternally displaced persons; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and \nethnic, religious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; \ntrafficking in persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and \nlimitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi \ngovernment\u2019s problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nApplicant admitted that his parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. His spouse was a citizen and resident of Iraq until September 2018. \nShe is now a resident of the United States. Her connections to her family in Iraq is the \nprimary security concern. \n \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily \nbecause of terrorists and insurgents. Applicant is willing to voluntarily share in those \ndangers on behalf of the DOD in the future. Numerous linguists, supporting U.S. forces, \nhave family living in Iraq. Hundreds of United States and coalition armed forces and \ncivilian contractors serving in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan are targets of \nterrorists, along with civilians and soldiers who support the Iraqi and Afghan \ngovernments and cooperate with coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a country hostile \nto the United States or with a problem with terrorists and insurgents is not, as a matter \nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her spouse \nhas such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone \nis sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nDec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Iraq with the United States, and the situation in that country places a \nsignificant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with \nany family member living in or visiting that country does not pose a trustworthiness or \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq.5  \n                                            \n5 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nGuideline B security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the \nUnited States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing \nISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Iraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the \nfuture. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq has a significant problem with \nterrorism. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes \nto the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would \nattempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, \n2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq or visiting that \ncountry create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure on \nhis family in Iraq in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThese relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced substantial \nevidence of Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s relationships with her family in Iraq and has raised the \nissue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) \napply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \n                                                                                                                                            \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) apply. Applicant has \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has resided in the United States since 2008. \nApplicant, his parents, and all of his siblings are citizens and residents of the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s spouse is a permanent resident of the United States. He swore an \noath of allegiance to the United States as part of the citizenship process. He is willing to \nserve in as a linguist in Iraq or Kuwait supporting U.S. goals in those countries.   \n \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to support the DOD in Iraq or Kuwait as a linguist and \ncultural advisor, including the dangers that service in Iraq entails, weighs towards \nmitigating security concerns. Applicant seeks a security clearance to enable him to \nprovide assistance to DOD possibly in a dangerous combat environment. He has \noffered to risk his life to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. His offer of service in a \ndangerous area of the world shows his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United \nStates.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006); ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n5, 2008); and ISCR Case No. 10-02803 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Iraq are limited as the only family members living in \nIraq are his parents-in-law and brother-in-law. His contact with them is primarily through \nhis spouse. He does not intend to travel to Iraq to visit them. He does not have property \nin Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with in-laws who are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. Like every other resident of Iraq, his in-laws are at risk from \ncriminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of the Iraqi government. \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Iraq and Kuwait and Applicant\u2019s willingness to support U.S. \ngoals and objectives in Iraq and Kuwait despite the risks to his personal safety. \nApplicant and his in-laws living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s \npotential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his in-laws living \nin that country from lawless elements in Iraq.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Iraq continue but are \nattenuated as they are through his wife. His connections to the United States taken \ntogether, including his willingness to support U.S. goals in a combat environment, are \nsufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 28 years old, and he wants to become a linguist for employment in \nIraq or Kuwait. In 2011, he graduated from high school in the United States. He has two \nyears of college. In June 2016, he married a citizen and resident of Iraq, and in \nSeptember 2018, his spouse immigrated to the United States. She is now a U.S. \npermanent resident. He does not have any children.   \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there.6 Iraq is a dangerous place because of violence \nfrom terrorists, and the Iraqi government does not respect the full spectrum of human \nrights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Iraqi government, the interests of the United \nStates, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist the United States. The \nUnited States and Iraqi governments are allies in the war on terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. \nApplicant rarely communicates with his in-laws in Iraq; however, his spouse \ncommunicates with them about three times a week. Her contacts with her family in Iraq \nare a manifestation of her care and concern for them. His relationship with his spouse \nand her relationships with residents of Iraq raise important foreign influence security \nconcerns. Those connections are balanced against his connections to the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings are citizens and residents of the United States. \nHe swore allegiance to the United States and offered to renounce his Iraqi citizenship. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole \nperson. I conclude foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \n                                            \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1.) On March 12, 2018, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline M (Use of Information \nTechnology), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), \n                                                 \n1 Mr. Nagel appeared at the August 21, 2018 hearing only. \n2 Ms. Karoian appeared at the September 19, 2018 hearing only. \n\n \n \n \n2 \n \n \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on March 30, 2018, with \nattachments, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on June 27, 2018. The case was assigned to me on \nJuly 11, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of \nHearing on July 18, 2018. The hearing was conducted on August 21, 2018, and \nSeptember 19, 2018.  \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits A through H, which were admitted \nwithout objection, and testified on his own behalf. The record remained open for the \nreceipt of additional documentation. DOHA received the final transcript of this hearing on \nSeptember 27, 2018. Applicant submitted an additional statement with his comments \nconcerning the transcript on October 2, 2018. That document is marked and admitted as \nApplicant Exhibit I. The record then closed.  \n  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old and is being sponsored for a security clearance by a \ndefense contractor. He is married and has a doctorate degree. Applicant owns his own \ncompany, but used to be employed by Company A.   \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline M, Use of Information Technology) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance because he failed to comply with rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to information technology systems.  \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \n  \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance because he engaged in conduct that involved \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations, thereby raising questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nBoth allegations in this case refer to a single act by Applicant in the days before \nhe was terminated from his employment with Company A. Applicant was hired by \nCompany A in June 2009 to fill a senior management position related to his particular \narea of expertise. He is an acknowledged expert in his field, which is limited to a very \n\n \n \n \n3 \n \n \nsmall number of people and companies. Company A expected Applicant to help grow \ntheir business in this field, which he did for several years. (Tr. 27-28.) \n \n \nBeginning in 2014, the relationship between Applicant and the leadership of \nCompany A began to sour. Applicant approached the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of \nCompany A and alleged that another senior manager was actively defrauding the Federal \ngovernment. The CEO said that he would look into it but, according to Applicant, instead \nthe CEO set about making Applicant\u2019s continued employment at Company A untenable. \n(Answer; Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 28, 75-76.) \n \n \nThe situation came to a head in early June 2015. On June 3, 2015, a coworker \nand friend of Applicant, Mr. E, was let go by Company A. Whether Mr. E actively resigned, \nhis threat to resign was accepted, or he was terminated, is of little significance to the \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. In any event, Mr. E\u2019s departure convinced \nApplicant he could no longer work for Company A. (Answer; Applicant Exhibits A and F; \nTr. 82-84.) \n \n \nOn June 4, 2015, before normal work hours, Applicant arrived at his office. \nAccording to Applicant he often did this. That morning Applicant printed out a copy of his \nOutlook contacts from Company A\u2019s computer system. Included in the Outlook file were \ncontacts that Applicant had before his employment, as well as those he acquired after he \nbegan employment, which included employees of Company A. Applicant stated that he \nprinted out the Outlook file so that he could go through it and separate out those contacts \nthat he had prior to employment with Company A, which the company had wanted him to \ndo for some time. (Applicant Exhibit F at Attachment 2; Tr. 59-61, 71-74.)   \n \n \nApplicant stated that later in the morning of June 4, 2015, he had a discussion with \nthe CEO, during which Applicant berated the CEO for Company A\u2019s conduct towards Mr. \nE, and informed the CEO that he wished to leave his employment with Company A in the \nnear future. He then left his place of employment with a folder containing the Outlook \nprintout. At this point, it is important to note, all parties agree that Applicant had not \nresigned or been terminated. (Answer; Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit F at \nAttachment 5; Tr. 28-29, 61-63, 75, 85-86.) \n \n \nCompany A wrote the Office of Personnel Management a letter dated May 25, \n2017, which concerned Applicant\u2019s conduct. That letter stated: \n \nOn June 4, 2015 [Company A\u2019s] Information Technology Department (IT) \nobserved [Applicant] accessing and printing out [Company A\u2019s] proprietary \ncustomer data as well as [Company A] contact information. There was no \nlegitimate business reason for this action and it occurred early in the \nmorning (between 6:47 am and 6:50 am) when, by [Applicant\u2019s] own words, \nhe was \u201cnot on the clock.\u201d (Government Exhibit 3 at 1.) \n \n\n \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nBased on the above-described conduct, according to Company A, the decision \nwas made to terminate Applicant for cause for violating the terms of his employment \ncontract. Applicant was informed of this fact in an email dated June 6, 2015. There is no \nallegation or evidence that Applicant took any other type of proprietary information. \n(Government Exhibit 3; Applicant Exhibit F at Attachment 5.) \n \n \nCompany A subsequently sent a letter to Applicant dated June 11, 2015. In that \nletter Company A advised Applicant that they believed his conduct in printing the Outlook \ncontacts file violated his employment agreement. In addition, and more pertinent to this \ndecision, Company A felt that Applicant\u2019s conduct violated their \u201cProprietary Information \nand Assignment of Inventions Agreement\u201d (PIAIA). (Government Exhibit 3.) \n \nThe PIAIA states in pertinent part that Applicant agrees: \n \n1.1. Recognition of Company\u2019s Rights: Nondisclosure. At all times during \nmy employment and thereafter I will hold in strictest confidence and will not \ndisclose, use . . . any of the Company\u2019s . . . Proprietary Information . . . , \nexcept as such disclosure, use . . . may be required in connection with my \nwork for the Company. . .  \n \n1.2. Proprietary Information. The term \u201cProprietary Information\u201d shall mean \nany and all confidential and/or proprietary knowledge, data, or information \nof the Company. . . By way of illustration but not limitation, \u201cProprietary \nInformation\u201d includes . . . (b) customer/prospective customer information, \ncustomer/client lists and all lists or other compilations containing client, \ncustomer or vendor information. . . Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is \nunderstood that, at all such times, I am free to use information which is or \nbecomes publicly known through lawful means, which was rightfully in my \npossession or part of my general knowledge prior to my employment with \nthe Company as specifically identified and disclosed by me in Exhibit A-2, \nor which is disclosed to me without confidence or proprietary restriction by \na third party who rightfully possesses the information (without confidential \nor proprietary restriction) and who did not learn of it directly from the \nCompany. (Government Exhibit 3.) \n \n \nApplicant argued that Company A\u2019s statement that he stole proprietary information \nin printing up the Outlook contacts list was a determination made after the fact to justify \nhis termination. According to Applicant, Company A used his action as a subterfuge in \norder not to pay a substantial amount of money upon his leaving the company. He \nmaintained that his conduct was appropriate, innocuous and within the scope of his \nemployment at the time. He admitted that he wanted to separate out his contacts from \nthe company\u2019s because he knew he was going to leave the company soon, not because \nhe thought he would be terminated. Applicant did not believe that the Outlook contacts \nlist was proprietary data. At that time Applicant also had a cell phone provided by \n\n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nCompany A that also contained the same Outlook contacts file. (Tr. 32-33, 57-58, 68-69, \n71-74, 84-87.) \n \n \nWithin a week or so after leaving employment Applicant returned the Outlook \ncontacts list to Company A\u2019s representative. (Answer at Exhibit 7 of Attachment 1; \nApplicant Exhibit F at Attachment 9; Tr. 67.) \n \n \nApplicant soon became involved in litigation with Company A over his termination. \nThat litigation was extensive and acrimonious. It eventually lead to an agreement between \nthe parties in which Applicant received a monetary settlement. Applicant maintained that \nthis litigation, along with other actions by Company A, were designed to prevent Applicant \nfrom working in the defense industry. Applicant submitted documents, pleadings and \ntranscripts concerning this litigation. The statements made in these documents are given \nappropriate weight in this decision. (Answer at Attachments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9; \nApplicant Exhibits A, B, D, E, and F at Attachments 1, 7, and 8; Tr. 29-30.)   \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant was a valued member of Company A until the time of his termination, as \nshown by his performance appraisal dated October 2014. (Answer at Exhibit 3 of \nAttachment 1.) \n \n \nApplicant provided letters of recommendation from people who know him in the \ndefense industry. He is described as a man of character, a person who is trustworthy, \nand a valued professional. They all recommend him for a position of trust. (Applicant \nExhibits C, G, and H.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n \n \n6 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline M, Use of Information Technology) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for use of information technology \nare set out in AG \u00b6 39, which states: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, or wireless \ndevice used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, protect, or move \ninformation. This includes any component, whether integrated into a larger \nsystem or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to enable or \nfacilitate those operations.  \n\n \n \n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology systems;  \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, or media to \nor from any information technology system when prohibited by rules, \nprocedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not authorized. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41 describes one condition that could mitigate the above security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness. \n \n \nApplicant left Company A under very contentious circumstances about which there \ncontinues to be factual disputes, as set forth in the record. In preparation for leaving the \ncompany, but while still employed, Applicant printed up his Outlook contacts file on June \n4, 2015. This turned out to be Applicant\u2019s last day of work. Company A stated that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in printing up the list amounted to theft of proprietary data, and that \nthey fired him because of that act. Applicant stated that his conduct was allowable, \ncertainly innocuous, and the list was not proprietary data. In analyzing this case two \nquestions must be answered. Was the Outlook contact list proprietary data of Company \nA? If so, did Applicant\u2019s conduct amount to stealing it, or otherwise misusing it, in \ncontravention of Company A\u2019s policies and procedures? \n \n \nApplicant admits that his Outlook contacts list contained contact information that \nwas obtained by him after he began working at Company A. Accordingly, it would come \nunder the PIAIA \u00b61.2. (b) \u201ccustomer/prospective customer information, customer/client \nlists and all lists or other compilations containing client, customer or vendor information.\u201d \nHowever, it is also arguable that Applicant\u2019s Outlook contact list contained information \nobtained by Applicant that was viewed as an allowable exception to that rule. This is \nparticularly true of information that can be obtained easily from other sources, particularly \nphone numbers and email addresses. (See Centennial Bank v. Servisfirst Bank Inc., No. \n8:16-cv-88-T-36JSS, 2016 WL 7325545, 7-8 (M.D. Fl. May 17, 2016) (Mag.), adopted \n2016 WL 4238766 (M.D. Fl. Aug. 11, 2016.)) \n\n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nI find by substantial evidence that Applicant knew, or should have known, that the \nOutlook contact list contained at least some proprietary information belonging to \nCompany A. Support for this finding is found in Applicant\u2019s statement that he was going \nto use the list to separate out the contacts that he had obtained before his employment \nwith Company A from those he only knew about after his employment. Applicant admitted \nat the hearing that this fact was true. \n \n \nHaving determined that Applicant had downloaded proprietary information, we turn \nto the question of whether he stole it. Here, I find that there is insufficient evidence of such \nconduct. Applicant has never denied taking the list, did not destroy the list, and promptly \nreturned it to Company A upon demand. The list may not be innocuous, but it is a stretch \nto call it important proprietary information.  \n \n \nApplicant maintained that Company A and its executives used this innocent \nincident as a subterfuge in order to terminate him for cause. He argues they did this so \nthat they did not have to give him the multi-million dollar severance pay he would have \nbeen owed if he left the company under favorable circumstances. Based on other findings \nin this Decision, there is no need to make a finding as to the reasons for the conduct of \nCompany A or its officers, and I am specifically not making any such finding. \n \n \nEven assuming, for the sake of argument, that Applicant did take the list without \nauthority, three years had passed since the incident as of the time the record closed. In \naddition, it occurred during a very strenuous and emotional time. Applicant was leaving a \njob he had worked at very successfully for several years. His outstanding job performance \nis shown by the 2014 evaluation contained in the record. Similar conduct is unlikely to \nrecur, and it does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment. Guideline M is found for Applicant. \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states in pertinent part: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n\n \n \n \n9 \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. That \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \nand \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 describes one condition that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nI also find that Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his conduct \nunder this guideline. There is no doubt that Applicant and Company A did not part on \ngood terms. That is shown by the voluminous legal records provided by Applicant. He \nreasonably viewed his conduct as innocuous and allowable. Applicant admitted that his \nconduct could have been viewed negatively. However, the evidence is insufficient to show \nthat it was untrustworthy, or showed sufficient poor judgment as to justify denial of national \nsecurity eligibility. While, arguably, his conduct could be seen as violating the PIAIA, it is \nvitiated by its minor nature and the time period since such conduct occurred.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant=s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n \n \n10 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns surrounding his alleged misuse of information technology, and related personal \nconduct. There is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and little likelihood \nof recurrence. Overall, the record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to \nApplicant=s present suitability for national security eligibility, and a security clearance. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by & E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant=s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1981. He served in \nthe military from 1982 to 1989 and was honorably discharged. He is pursuing a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He married in 1982.

She and her children live with Applicant. His daughter does not receive child \nsupport. She sporadically contributes to the household.2  \n \n \n \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in 2015. He purchased a house \nin July 2015. Shortly thereafter, he and his wife had marital problems. He moved out of \nthe house in December 2015. His wife has medical issues and is unable to work. In \nJanuary 2016, his daughter lost her job and moved in with Applicant\u2019s wife. Applicant \nstarted supporting two households, which included his daughter\u2019s family. This had a major \nimpact on his finances. He lost his job in August 2017. He maintained the two households \nuntil he and his wife reconciled in November 2017, and he moved back into their house.3  \n \nIn 2014, Applicant moved to a different state for a job. He withdrew money from \nhis pension plan and believed the federal income tax was paid at the time of his \nwithdrawal. In 2015, he learned that he owed more federal income taxes as the amount \nwas not fully paid (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$21,578). He testified that he contacted the company that \nwas handling his pension plan and was told that only a percentage of the tax was paid. \nHe contacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and arranged an installment agreement \nto pay the taxes owed. The agreement was to pay $300 a month. The IRS involuntarily \nwithheld subsequent annual tax refunds and applied them to the balance. He testified that \nhe started the installment agreement sometime in 2015 and made the payments until he \nstopped in late 2017 when he lost his job. He said he contacted the IRS, but did not make \nanother payment until March 2018. In October 2018, he entered into a new installment \nagreement with the IRS to pay $150 a month until December 2019, when the amount will \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is the exhibit list and II is the discovery letter.  \n \n2 Tr. 17-24. \n \n3 Tr. 24-27, 35-36. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nincrease to $375. He makes an automatic monthly payment. He provided proof of his \nmost recent payment.4 It is being resolved. \n \nIn November 2016, Applicant fell behind on his mortgage payments because he \nwas maintaining two households (SOR \u00b61.b-$10,725). He contacted the mortgage \ncompany and entered a loan modification agreement in May 2017. He made timely \npayments on the new mortgage agreement until he lost his job in August 2017. He \ncontacted his mortgage company again and a new loan modification was approved in \nFebruary 2018. He made a lump-sum payment of $8,038 in October 2018 to catch up, \nand has been making the new payments. He provided proof of his November 2018 \npayment. He testified he obtained the lump-sum amount from a loan that he is repaying. \nHe provided proof that he is paying the loan. Applicant and his wife have decided to sell \nthe house and are working with a realtor to put it on the market. They intend to downsize \nand purchase a more affordable house. The mortgage in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($10,725) is being \nresolved. 5 \n \n \nThe credit-card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($14,802) was used by Applicant when he was \nseparated from his wife to help him pay expenses. He said he made some payments to \nthe collection company. He provided a copy of a recent payment plan with the collection \ncompany, which required he pay $2,000 in November 2018 and monthly payments \nthereafter of $500 a month. He provided proof of his $2,000 payment.6 The debt is being \nresolved. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,802) became past due when Applicant lost his job. He \nhas a payment plan with the creditor that agrees to monthly automatic withdrawals of \n$231. He provided documented proof of the agreement with the creditor and his \nNovember payment.7 The debt is being resolved. \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,159) is a debt that became delinquent when Applicant \nlost his job. He provided documented proof that he is making payments to resolve the \ndebt. He testified that he believed the remaining balance owes is about $700.8 This debt \nis being resolved.  \n \n \nApplicant was unaware he owed the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($89). He paid the \ndebt in April 2018. He provided documented proof.9 This debt is resolved.  \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 32-35, 49-56; Answer to SOR; AE A, J, O. \n \n5 Tr. 37-49; Answer to the SOR; AE B, L, P, Q, T.  \n \n6 Tr. 59-62; Answer to SOR; AE C, K, M. \n \n7 Tr. 63-65; AE D, S. \n \n8 Tr. 66-68; AE E, F, R. \n \n9 Tr. 68; AE G. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a detailed copy of a budget he has been using for a couple of \nmonths. It includes all of his payment plans and debts. He testified that he and his family \nhave significantly cut their expenses. They do not go out to eat. He does not take his \ngrandchildren out for entertainment because he cannot afford it. In his post-hearing \nsubmission, he stated that his son and daughter are now paying the house\u2019s utility bills to \nhelp with the expenses.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n                                                          \n10 Tr. 56-59, 69; AE H, N. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely pay a federal tax debt for the early withdrawal from his \npension. Applicant lost his job and was unable to pay some bills, which became \ndelinquent in about 2016. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant began experiencing financial problems when he and his wife separated \nin late 2015; his daughter and her family then moved in with his wife; and he lost his job \nin 2017. Applicant also incurred a tax debt from an early withdrawal from his pension plan. \nHe believed the tax was withheld, but later learned he owed the tax. Applicant is resolving \nall of the debts alleged in the SOR, but at this juncture, they remain ongoing and recent. \nAG 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nAs explained above, Applicant\u2019s financial problems were beyond his control. For \nthe full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant obtained loan modifications to ensure he could become current \non his mortgage. He contacted the IRS when he became aware of the deficiency. He \narranged an installment agreement with the IRS. When he lost his job, he could not make \nthe payments. He has a new agreement that he is paying. He contacted other creditors \nand negotiated repayment agreements and is making payments to resolve the debts. \nApplicant did not ignore his financial obligations, but addressed them as best he could at \nthe time. I find he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.  \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant sought financial counseling, but there \nare indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. There is sufficient evidence that Applicant is adhering to repayment plans that he \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninitiated in a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. He is making payments on his \ninstallment agreement with the IRS and is paying his mortgage after receiving a loan \nmodification. He is paying his other creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant contacted the IRS when he learned he owed additional taxes on his \npension plan withdrawal. He made payments until he experienced financial difficulties \nafter losing his job. He negotiated a new installment agreement with the IRS and provided \nsufficient proof that he is in compliance. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. Several circumstances contributed to his financial \ndifficulties: unexpected problems after he purchased a house; his and his wife\u2019s \nseparation; and the loss of his job. He subsequently maintained two households, when \nhis daughter and her three children moved in with his wife. All of these factors caused \nhim to get behind on his obligations. Applicant was not living beyond his means during \nthat time, and he did not ignore his debts. He has payment arrangements with his \ncreditors. He obtained a loan modification for his mortgage and has a new installment \nagreement with the IRS. Applicant\u2019s finances are coming under control, and he is acting \nresponsibly by addressing his debts. He intends to sell his house and in the interim has \nlowered his expenses. He has a detailed budget that accommodates his expenses and \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s past financial problems no longer raise questions about his judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. The record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts \n\n \n8 \n \n \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

James Turner, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 13, \n2016. On August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, admitting all of the SOR allegations except \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleging falsification of his SCA. He admitted failing to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for seven years and to violating his employer\u2019s policies about safe \n03/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nworkplace and computer use, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, and 2.b. Applicant also \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 25, 2019. On February 7, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 28, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and his counsel submitted documents, \nwhich were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 61 years old. He graduated from high school in 1975, and has some \ncollege, but no degree. (Tr. 43) He is married since 1980 with four adult children, and \nsix grandchildren. Applicant served honorably as a radar man in the U.S. Navy from \n1975 to 1979, and he earned several awards for his military service. (Tr. 40) He has \nbeen employed as a logistics manager for a major federal contractor since 1983. He  \nreports having a security clearance for 42 years, without incident. (Tr. 9)  \n \nThe SOR alleges his failure to timely file federal income tax returns for seven \nyears from tax year (TY) 2010 to TY 2016. Applicant admitted this allegation in his \nanswer to the SOR. Applicant testified that he has recently filed all of the delinquent \nfederal income tax returns. (Tr. 44-45) He provided answers to interrogatories in April \n2018 indicating that he does not owe unpaid federal income taxes for any period, and \nhe does not owe unpaid state income taxes. He also attached Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) income tax transcripts for TY 2010 through TY 2017.  \n \nThe IRS transcripts reveal that Applicant filed his income tax returns late in all \nrelevant years as follows: TY 2010 filed April 21, 2013; TY 2011 filed April 22, 2013; TY \n2012 filed May 22, 2013; TY 2013 filed August 28, 2017 (more than three years late); \nTY 2014 secured February 27, 2018; TY 2015 filed January 22, 2018; and TY 2016 filed \nJanuary 23, 2018. He also attached a copy of a FORM 1040 income tax return for TY \n2017 indicating that he earned adjusted gross income (AGI) of $225,298. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he employed a certified public accountant (CPA) starting in 2014-\n2015; he never requested an extension of time to file income tax returns late; and he \nwas never penalized by the IRS. (TR. 45-47)  \n \nApplicant testified that \u201cI just believed because there was money coming back, \nthere was no concern. I had the mindset that the government is making out because \ntheir holding onto my money longer.\u201d (Tr. 47) He did not know that willful failure to file \nincome tax returns timely, when required, would constitute a misdemeanor under \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s September 13, 2016 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) and the summary of his personal subject interview (PSI) on \nOctober 25, 2017. (GE 1-2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfederal law.2 (Tr. 45) He testified that it just was not a priority in his life. (Tr. 48) He \nnever contacted the IRS to inquire about possible problems with filing tax returns late. \n(Tr. 50) When he filed the tax returns late, he received refunds every year, except TY \n2013. He was informed that since he filed more than three years late in that particular \nTY, he was not entitled to the refund that he would have otherwise received. (Tr. 76-77)  \n \nApplicant denied the allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.c that he falsified material facts when \nhe completed his SCA and responded \u201cNo\u201d to all questions in section 26. The allegation \nstates he \u201cdeliberately failed to disclose that which is set forth in subparagraphs 1.a and \n1.b, above.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.a concerned the failure to file federal income tax returns for TYs \n2010\u20132016, but there is no SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant testified credibly that when he \ncompleted the SCA in September 2016, he was still laboring under the false impression \nthat he did not have to file returns, if he was owed a refund. Thus, he did not \ndeliberately intend to falsify his SCA. He felt that since he had filed or was filing the \nreturns, albeit late, he was in compliance. (Tr. 23-24, 39)   \n \nIn May 2015, Applicant received a final written warning for violating his \nemployer\u2019s policy for maintaining a safe and respectful workplace free from threats and \nviolence. (GE 7) Applicant was counseling a subordinate, when he became exasperated \nand behaved in an unprofessional and inappropriate manner by slamming his hands on \nthe table and raising his voice in an angry tone. When the subordinate employee tried to \nexit the room, Applicant slammed the door and tried to dissuade the subordinate from \ngoing to speak to a supervisor. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant testified he never placed a hand on \nthe subordinate, but he was admittedly frustrated with the subordinate\u2019s response. \nApplicant stated it wasn\u2019t the first time he was called out at work for having a loud voice. \n(Tr. 35) It was the only written warning that he received. (GE 6, 7) \n \nA joint personnel adjudications system (JPAS) entry dated August 31, 2016, \nindicates that Applicant received a one-week suspension and final written warning for \nunauthorized downloads and violation of his employer\u2019s computer-use policies. (GE 5, \n6) Applicant admitted this allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b and testified that he was negotiating \nwith an un-cleared person about possible procurement and use of another company\u2019s \nproprietary information contained on a thumb drive. (Tr. 36-38) He accepted the thumb \ndrive, which contained engineering documents for Applicant\u2019s company to review for a \npossible bid. (Tr. 37)  \n \nA colleague of Applicant\u2019s informed him that the colleague was not comfortable \ndownloading this thumb drive\u2019s contents onto corporate computers of Applicant\u2019s \nemployer because it might violate computer-security policy. (Tr. 63) Applicant testified \nhe was impatient that the thumb drive had not already been scanned by security, and \nhe was motivated to move forward with the project. (Tr. 61-62) He acknowledged his \ncolleague\u2019s concerns and receipt of a June 1, 2016 email advising that the best course \nwas to take the thumb drive to security for screening before insertion.3 (Tr. 63)  \n                                                          \n2 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203. \n \n3 GE 6, attachment 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant nonetheless plugged the thumb drive directly into his employer\u2019s computer \nand uploaded it onto the corporate shared drive. (Tr. 63, 67)  He acknowledged that this \nwas an error in judgment. (Tr. 67) No malware infection or damage resulted from this \nbreach of policy. (Tr. 72) Applicant stated that he had taken annual computer-security \ntraining and certifications, but earlier computer training did not emphasize the \nprohibition against introducing outside media (thumb drives, DVDs, CDs) into \nproprietary corporate-owned computers. (Tr. 74-75)  \n \nApplicant sought to improve his computer skills-knowledge, and he took \nadditional courses provided to adjust his leadership style. (Tr. 39) He provided several \nperformance evaluations for each year from 2012 through 2017. (AE A) They reflect that \nApplicant exceeded or significantly exceeded his employer\u2019s goals and expectations \nmost years. He also provided three favorable character reference letters from his \npastor, church administrator and a colleague. (AE B-D) They attest to Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, integrity, honesty and work ethic. I found his testimony was direct and candid. \n \n \n \n                                   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napplies here:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state or local income taxes as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal income tax returns as alleged in the SOR, \nis confirmed by his IRS income tax transcripts, clearance interview, and answer to the \nSOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to support the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.4 Applicant has not met that burden. He \nexercised poor judgment in repeatedly failing to file, or filing federal income tax returns \nlate, for seven years from 2010-2016.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with appropriate tax authority to \nfile or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant was under the mistaken impression that he did not have to file federal \nincome tax returns timely if he was to receive a refund. He did not contact the IRS or \nsolicit advice about the validity of this belief. He testified that he hired a CPA starting in \n2014-2015, and he received refunds for each relevant TY from 2010 \u2013 2016, with the \nexception of TY 2013. He provided the IRS tax transcripts that substantiate his \ntestimony that he has now filed the federal tax returns, albeit late. Although he derived \nhis income almost exclusively from the Navy or federal contractors (federal taxes) for \nalmost four decades, he did not view filing his tax returns timely as a high priority. His \nefforts to resolve his tax issues have not met the mark. In short, his response has been \ntoo little, too late.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \n The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nThe Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes. The following \nnormally will result in an unfavorable national security eligibility \ndetermination, security clearance action, or cancellation of further \nprocessing for national security eligibility: \n                                                          \n4 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to \nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview, completing \nsecurity forms or releases, cooperation with medical or psychological \nevaluation, or polygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives \nin connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified information. This \nincludes but is not limited to, considerations of: \n \n   \n \n   \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources.  \n \nInsufficient evidence has been presented to conclude that Applicant deliberately \nintended to falsify section 26 of his SCA. He violated his employer\u2019s computer use and \nsafe workplace policies and received a final written warning. He wrongfully introduced \nthe un-cleared contents of a thumb drive into the shared-drive server of his company \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncomputer. He did so after a discussion with a colleague and an email dated June 1, \n2016, cautioning against it. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(2) and (4), are implicated and the \nfocus shifts to a determination of which, if any of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \nAG 17. Conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns  \n            Include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nApplicant testified that the April 2015 incident when he pounded his hands on a \ntable and slammed a door on a subordinate was not the first time that he was called out \nfor being loud and disruptive. It was not a one-time outburst. He has acknowledged his \nemotional leadership style and made great strides to improve by attending company \ntraining and taking courses to improve his counseling manner and computer skills. This \nincident occurred over four years ago.  \n \nHe plugged a contraband, un-cleared, thumb drive into the corporate shared-\ndrive almost three years ago. He was forward-leaning and wanted to move ahead with \nthe project. Although he had been cautioned not to plug it in before screening the thumb \ndrive at security, he acknowledge he acted impulsively in doing so. He subsequently \nhad formal corporate computer security training explicitly prohibiting this practice. It was \na significant lapse in judgment and a direct violation of his employer\u2019s computer-use \npolicy prohibiting external media. He also violated company safe workplace policy when \nhe slammed the door on his subordinate. He has demonstrated a pattern of \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. These characteristics indicate he \nmay not properly safeguard classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b617(c) and 16 (d) apply only \npartially. Insufficient time has elapsed since these lapses to safely conclude that such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline. Applicant raised a family and  \nserved honorably in the Navy. He made significant contributions to the DOD for several \ndecades. Most importantly, Applicant has not mitigated the specific allegations in the \nSOR concerning his failure to file federal income tax returns timely for seven years, and \nrepeated violations of company policy. He has not met his burden of production.  \n \nApplicant did not intend to falsify his 2016 SCA. However, his judgment remains \na security concern. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that his financial problems \nare under control, and he will not repeat his previous behavior. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns arising under Guideline F, or the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n              AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:       \n \n \n \n   Against Applicant            \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                                     Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a \u2013 2.b:                                        Against Applicant  \n \n           Subparagraphs 2.c:                                                For Applicant \n \n \n                                        \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 6, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on December 4, \n2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant was \n03/11/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not provide a response \nto the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Items 1 through \n6 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 27, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He began college in 2006 and graduated in May 2012 \nhaving earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He married in 2013. He has no children. Applicant \nhas been employed by a federal contractor since October 2016.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has approximately $156,322 in delinquent student \nloans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g). He stated in his October 2016 security clearance \napplication (SCA) the following: \n \nI attended a private university. With little financial literacy, I took out private \nand government loans that I couldn\u2019t hope to pay. Since leaving college, \nI\u2019ve been unemployed and haven\u2019t been able to secure a job that paid more \nthan $13.25 an hour. The defaulted loans are a consequence of my inability \nto secure adequate wages given my college education and my inconsistent \nemployment history. I wish the story was different but those are the facts.1 \n \n* * * \n \nMy Federal Student Loans tally to approximately $51,988. My private loans \nare approximately $177,683.2 \n \nRegarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h (credit card debt-$1,189), 1.k (medical debt-\n$119), 1.l (medical debt-$63), and 1.j (cell phone debt-$198), Appellant stated in his SCA \nthe following: \n \nThe credit card was a simple issue of non-repayment. It\u2019s been closed and \nwritten off. The other three collection issues are still pending and total $380 \ndollars. One is a cancellation fee, the other is a fee for an urgent care trip \nthat I thought was resolved a long time ago and the last one is a fee that \nwas supposed to be paid by my previous employer when I was forced to \nvisit the ER within the hospital I was working at.  \n \n* * * \n \n                                                          \n1 Item 3. \n \n2 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe [credit card] charge has been written off and charged off as a bad debt. \nThe other three are still open in collections.3  \n \n* * * \n \nThe open collection accounts are simple to resolve. $380 dollars will take \ncare of that. The [credit card debt] issue has been resolved.4  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2017. He \nwas confronted with the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. He \ntold the investigator these were private student loans, and he cannot afford to pay them \nbecause he does not earn enough income. The creditor offered to settle the debt for a \nlump sum amount of $63,000, but Applicant could not afford it. He has no plans to resolve \nthese loans because he cannot afford to make the monthly payments required.5  \n \n \nApplicant was not sure if the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were \nprivate student loans or government loans. He stated his government student loans were \nin a rehabilitation program, and he did not know if the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g were \npart of that program. He said he could not pay these loans because he does not earn \nenough income.6  \n \nApplicant told the investigator that he intended to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l by \nDecember 2017.He said that he would contact the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k in \nDecember 2017, to discuss it. He said he contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j \nand would call the creditor again in December 2017, to try and resolve it. Regarding the \ncredit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, he did not plan on contacting the creditor to resolve it \nbecause he cannot pay this debt and his federal student loans at the same time. Applicant \ndid not provide any documents or other information regarding his efforts to resolve these \nsmaller debts.7  \n \n \nThe investigator confronted Applicant with the charged off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m \n($2,200). This was a loan he used to purchase his wife\u2019s engagement ring. He indicated \nthat because he had inconsistent employment, he was unable to pay this loan. Due to his \ncurrent plan to pay his federal loans, he does not have sufficient funds to resolve this \ndebt.8  \n \n                                                          \n3 Item 3. \n \n4 Item 3.  \n \n5 Item 4. \n \n6 Item 4. \n \n7 Item 4. \n \n8 Item 4. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant was employed from October 2015 to September 2016 before starting his \ncurrent job. He disclosed that he worked as a camp counselor during the summers (June \nthrough August) while in college from 2009 to 2012, and then continued during the \nsummers through 2016. He lists other employment from September 2014 to February \n2015 (he left this job because it was a temporary job for six months); October 2013 to \nMay 2014 (he left this job to work at summer camp); November 2012 to December 2012 \n(he quit this job because it did not suit him).9  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator that he and his wife took a five-day cruise \nin August 2017 to the Bahamas. He and his wife also took a five-day cruise to Jamaica \nand Cayman Islands in May 2014.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from January 2017 and February 2018 \ncorroborate all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant did not provide any information \nabout his and his wife\u2019s current income; documents to substantiate he is paying his federal \nstudent loans; a budget; or proof that he resolved the smaller debts.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n9 Items 3, 4. \n \n10 Items 3, 4. \n \n11 Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent student loans, credit card debts, medical debts, and other \ndebts totaling more than $160,000. He is unwilling and unable to pay his delinquent debts. \nDespite stating he would address the small debts, he failed to provide proof that he did. \nHe does not intend to resolve his private student loans and other debts. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid or provided evidence of action he may have taken to resolve \nany of the delinquent student loans or other debts that are charged off or in collection. His \ndelinquent debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nunemployment \nand \nunderemployment. These were conditions beyond his control. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. Applicant did not provided sufficient \nevidence to show he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant attended \ncollege for six year and obtained student loans to pay for his education. He was aware of \nthe amount of the loans he was using for his education. Although he said his federal \nstudent loans are in a rehabilitation program, he failed to provide evidence to substantiate \nhis claim. He has decided that the amount owed for his private student loans is too much \nto pay; however, he and his wife took a cruise in 2014. Applicant has been employed \nsince October 2015. He has not made an effort to pay a $63 medical bill or the loan he \n\n \n7 \n \n \nobtained to purchase his wife\u2019s engagement ring. After he completed the SCA in October \n2016, which put him on notice that his delinquent debts were a concern, he took a cruise \nwith his wife in August 2017. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling and his debts are \nunder control. There is no evidence he is making good-faith efforts to pay any of debts \nalleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He has an overwhelming amount of student loans that \nare delinquent. He indicated he had no hope of paying them. He indicated that he is \npaying his federal student loans, but provided no evidence. He has not paid small \nconsumer debts, including a loan for his wife\u2019s engagement ring. He did not provide \nevidence of any action he has taken to resolve, settle, or pay these debts. Applicant did \nnot provide evidence of his current financial budget or a plan for resolving his financial \nproblems. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves \nme with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting sensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding information.

The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for \nSORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on April 27, 2018, and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 20, 2018. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \n(NOH) scheduling the hearing on August 8, 2018. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 3 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 J were admitted without objection. I left the record open for \n09/14/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \none week until August 15, 2018, for Applicant to submit a letter from her mother and \ncounty court documents from her divorce. (Tr. 74) She submitted these timely and her \npost-hearing documents were admitted as AE L. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2018. \n \n \n \n                   .    \n \n  \nApplicant is 33 years old. She graduated from high school in 2003. She obtained \nher licensed practical nurse (LPN) certificate in 2014. Applicant married in 2004 and \ndivorced in 2005. She married again in late 2005 and divorced in 2014. She has a 12- \nyear-old daughter from that marriage. (Tr. 13) Applicant served in the Army National \nGuard from 2002 to 2005, and she received an honorable discharge after being \nmedically separated. (Tr. 56-57) She has been employed by a federal agency working \nas a customer service representative since November 2016. (Tr. 14) Applicant and her \ndaughter live with Applicant\u2019s mother, who has a serious illness, and her step-father \nwho is also disabled and unemployed. Applicant provides financial support to her \nmother and step-father. (Tr. 15, AE L)  \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she struggled financially due to a protracted divorce \nprocess, starting with her separation in 2011. The divorce lasted three years and was \ncontentious and expensive. (Tr. 15-16) She was a single mother raising her daughter \nand her ex-husband\u2019s son from a prior relationship, as well as supporting her parents. \nApplicant testified and produced family court documents showing that her ex-husband \nwas supposed to pay half of their daughter\u2019s medical expenses and $500 in child \nsupport each month according to the divorce decree. (Tr.17, AE L) However, since May \n2015, he was only actually paying child support in the amount of $245 each month \npursuant to a court ordered wage assignment or garnishment. (AE L)  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts including student loans, consumer credit \ndebt, and medical debts totaling $91,278. Approximately $65,000 of that total debt, is \nowed to the Department of Education (DOE) for delinquent student loans as alleged at \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.i. Applicant produced a document reflecting a balance of $81,741 \nowed to DOE on February 27, 2018, as the interest continues to accrue. (AE A) \nApplicant obtained the student loans to attend four different colleges in pursuit of her \nnursing degree. (Tr. 24) Applicant provided a character reference from one of her \nprofessors attesting to the fact that Applicant was a straight-A student and graduated \nwith honors. (AE K) She produced loan-rehabilitation documents at the hearing showing \nthat she has now consolidated the afore-mentioned student loans for repayment, and \nentered into a plan to make payments of $61 each month starting in May 2018. (Tr. 22, \nAE A)  \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has paid in full the $6,334 in court costs and fines \nassociated with her failure to maintain automobile insurance as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n                                                          \n2 Unless otherwise indicated, these facts were taken from Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as a security clearance application (SCA) dated May 5, \n2017, and signed on the date of the hearing. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(Tr. 26, AE B) However, she testified that she borrowed this money from her mother to \npay the county court, and she still owes her mother $3,000. (Tr. 26-27) She has not yet \nreached out to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b to establish a repayment plan. In her Answer to \nthe SOR in April 2018, Applicant admitted to this charged-off debt, which resulted when \nshe had inadequate insurance to cover an automobile wreck. Applicant denied the \ncharged-off debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, claiming that it was her ex-husband\u2019s debt. She \nproduced no documents to substantiate this assertion.  \n \n \n \nApplicant disputed the delinquent medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j because she \nactually had health insurance coverage but the provider used her wrong date of birth in \nsubmitting the bill. She produced evidence of health insurance and this debt is now paid \nin full. (AE C) SOR \u00b6 1.k is disputed because Applicant was only supposed to rent the \nsubsidized apartment in question if she was enrolled full-time at the university. \nAlthough, Applicant produced documentation showing that she was working full time, \nwhile attending college, she has not demonstrated that she was enrolled full-time, or \nthat she effectively disputed this debt with the creditor. (AE D)  \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l and expressed her \nintent to mitigate it in her Answer. She stated that this was a joint debt with her ex-\nhusband and his son. He refuses to pay this and many other joint debts acquired during \ntheir marriage. She offered no evidence of any payment plan, and this debt remains \nunresolved. Applicant produced documentation at the hearing showing that the medical \ndebts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.u, owed to the same creditor, were paid in full on \nJuly 5, 2018. (AE H) The delinquency owed to a debt collection agency alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.p has been paid in full in January 2018, after Applicant\u2019s pay was garnished in the \namount of $100 each pay period. (Tr. 48, AE G) Applicant also produced documents at \nthe hearing showing that the small consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.s and 1.t have \nbeen paid. (AE J) The debt placed for collection by a bank, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.o now \nhas a zero balance (AE F) and the medical debt placed for collection as alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 1.r has been paid in full. (Tr. 41, AE E)   \n \nApplicant testified that the $5,976 student-loan debt owed directly to the \nUniversity was supposed to be covered by her ex-husband\u2019s GI bill education benefits. \n(Tr. 66) However, she provided no documentation to show that it was effectively \ndisputed or resolved. In Applicant\u2019s Answer, she stated that she dropped out of this \nparticular university due to her divorce. The remaining alleged consumer and medical \ndelinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.n, 1.v, 1.w and 1.x have not been resolved. \nApplicant claims in her Answer that these were all debts incurred for their daughter\u2019s \nexpenses. Her ex-husband has not paid half as required by their divorce decree.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother provided a character reference confirming that Applicant went \nthrough a bitter and expensive divorce and her ex-husband was ordered to pay half of \ntheir daughter\u2019s medical costs and child support. He failed to do so.  (AE L) Applicant \nhas stepped up to help out her mother and step-father financially, and she graduated \nnursing school with a 4.0 grade point average, and honors.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s exhibits support the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant admitted to owing the delinquent student loan debts alleged in the SOR \ntotaling approximately $81,000. These make up the majority of her total delinquent debt. \nThey are her individual debts. She provided post-hearing documents to show a payment  \nplan with DOE on her consolidated student loans. However, this plan was entered into a \nfew months before the hearing and no evidence of a stream of $61 payments pursuant \nto the plan has been offered. These longstanding debts are evidenced by her most \nrecent credit bureau report. She has endured a long, expensive divorce and she is a \nsingle mother. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that she disputed many of \nthe debts, but submitted no dispute letters to show that she corresponded with, or \nnegotiated with her creditors. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of \nthe above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she intended to mitigate or pay \nher debts. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of \ndebt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct 23, 2013). She has made great strides in paying off some of the minor \nconsumer debts, and she recently entered into an eleventh-hour payment plan with \nDOE. However, these efforts are too little, too late. Insufficient time has passed to \nconfidently conclude that she will continue to make payments. Otherwise, she produced \ninadequate documentation to show payments or progress on any of her delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR. The delinquencies alleged in the SOR are longstanding and \nongoing. Her divorce was a condition beyond Applicant\u2019s control. She has not \ndemonstrated that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. She provided no \nevidence of financial counseling or a budget to show that her financial problems have \nbeen resolved and are under control. Applicant made only minimal good-faith efforts to \nrepay creditors. The mitigating conditions enumerated above at \u00b6 20(b) and \u00b6 20(d) \nhave only partial application. Otherwise, none of the mitigating conditions enumerated \nabove apply.   \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant is a single mother of a twelve-year old \nchild, and she supports her infirm parents. She deserves great credit for working full \ntime while educating herself. She has endured an expensive divorce and struggled \nthrough a downturn in the economy.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a trustworthiness concern. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:                         Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.n:                        Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.v \u2013 1.x:                        Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j, 1.o, and 1.p:             For Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q \u2013 1.u:                        For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a  public trust \nposition.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGregg A. Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 22, 2016. On \nMarch 14, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.1 Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on June 18, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 1, 2018, scheduling the \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) were revised effective June 8, 2017, and apply herein. \n01/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nhearing for August 30, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, \nand Applicant Exhibit (AE) A was admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 10, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old technician, employed full time by a defense contractor \nsince September 2016, and part time as a student intern from August 2015 to September \n2016. He was unemployed from 2008 to 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. \nHe married in 1998 and divorced in 2000; again in 2004 and divorced in 2012; and finally \nremarried in 2017. He has four children and two stepchildren. He served on active duty \nin the U.S. Air Force from 1995 to 1999 and from 2000 to 2005. He was honorably \ndischarged both times.  Applicant held a security clearance while in the military. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant is delinquent on child support, education loans, and a \nmedical account totaling approximately $64,000. The SOR allegations are supported by \nsubstantial evidence. Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when his second spouse divorced him. He \nwas a full-time student and was not working. From 2012 to 2016, Applicant made no \npayments for child support. He restarted payments in 2017 via a garnishment from his \npaycheck. He believes he still owes about $39,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) \n \nApplicant owes about $17,000 plus interest in unpaid student loans. He believes \nthey are now in default. Applicant has insufficient income to pay his student loans. He has \nnot contacted the government creditor to arrange a repayment plan. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.e.) \n \nApplicant owes approximately $782 on a medical bill incurred while he was a \nstudent. He paid about half of the debt before stopping payments in 2014 because of \ninsufficient income. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \n \nApplicant admitted that he lives paycheck to paycheck, and has no net remainder \nafter paying monthly expenses. He and his spouse owe on credit cards, rental \nagreements, and vehicle loans, one of which is a title loan. He describes himself as \nincredibly lazy when it comes to financial matters and paying bills. He has not sought \nfinancial counseling. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \n\n \n3 \n \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record supporting the \nSOR allegations are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of inability to pay debts owed. Although he has been \nworking full-time with his current employer since 2016, he has not shown a willingness or \nfinancial ability to address delinquent debts, except for involuntary garnishment payments \nfor his child support arrearage. He allowed his childsupport obligations to default over a \nnumber of years, and has only begun to address them through a garnishment. Although \nit is being resolved now, Applicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility with regard to this debt \nin particular, is concerning. He showed an inability or unwillingness to engage his student \nloan and medical debt creditors, and described himself as incredibly lazy with financial \nmatters. He has not sought financial counseling, and has not disputed his debts or the \namounts owed. \n \nOverall, I find that Applicant has continued his long-standing financial \nirresponsibility, and has not adequately addressed his delinquent debts and showed \nfinancial responsibility expected of security clearance applicants. I find that his financial \nstatus is not under control and that similar problems are likely to recur. No mitigating \nconditions fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).2 Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of \nfact and comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and difficulties with personal relationships do not overcome his history of financial \nirresponsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n                                                     \n2 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to \ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age \nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence \nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His request \nfor a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 15, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a defense contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \n01/03/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance.1 \n \n \nOn March 21, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F).2 Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on August 9, 2018, and convened the requested hearing on \nNovember 28, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. Applicant and one witness testified. Applicant also \nproffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 G. All exhibits were admitted without objection.  \n \n \nI also held the record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant \ninformation. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 7, 2018. The record \nclosed on December 20, 2018, when I received Department Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection \nto Applicant\u2019s timely post-hearing submissions, are admitted as AX H - Q.3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed $20,371 for ten \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.j).

He requires a security clearance for access to the \nfacilities to which he is assigned for work. Applicant and his wife were married in April \n2017 after living together since July 2010. Applicant was previously married between \nSeptember 1992 and April 1997, and between April 2004 and June 2010. He has one \nchild, now an adult, from his first marriage. Applicant paid monthly child support as \nrequired between his divorce in 1997 and September 2015, when his support obligations \nended.

On December 10, 2016, the Director of National \nIntelligence issued a new version of the adjudicative guidelines, to be effective for all adjudications on or \nafter June 8, 2017. My decision in this case would have been the same under either version. \n \n3 AX H and AX I are letters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisors; AX J is additional information \nregarding SOR 1.a; AX K is additional information about Applicant\u2019s history of meeting his child support \nobligations since November 2003; AX L is additional information about the medical debts at SOR 1.e, 1.g, \nand 1.j; AX M pertains to SOR 1.b; AX N reflects Applicant\u2019s request for information about the debt at SOR \n1.f; AX O pertains to SOR 1.h and 1.i; AX P documents payments on the debt at SOR 1.d; and AX Q \ncontains information about Applicant\u2019s use of a credit counseling firm and a copy of a recent credit report. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant attended a technical training institute between 2009 and 2013, receiving \ncertification as a help desk professional. He also attended one month training courses in \n2006, 2007, and 2014. He financed his 2009 \u2013 2013 studies through student loans that \nare currently in forbearance. Applicant has been employed in a variety of jobs since at \nleast 2006. He was unemployed at the end of his employers\u2019 contracts between May 2013 \nand November 2014; and in April and May 2015. All of the alleged debts in the SOR are \ndocumented in two credit reports obtained during his background investigation. (GX 1 \u2013 \n3; AX D) \n \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.a is for unpaid rent placed in collection and enforced by a civil \njudgment entered against Applicant in July 2012. Available information shows Applicant \nmade several payments on this debt in 2012 and 2013. More recently, Applicant has been \ntrying to negotiate a settlement or repayment plan for the remaining balance due. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX J; Tr. 31 \u2013 36) \n \n \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.b is for unpaid debt, also in 2012. Applicant submitted \ninformation showing this debt has been paid. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX G; AX M; Tr. 36 \n\u2013 38) \n \n \nApplicant disputes the debt at SOR 1.c, which is for a delinquent cell phone \naccount. He submitted information that shows the creditor has no information attributing \nthis debt to Applicant. The debt is not listed in the credit report Applicant submitted. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX F; AX Q; Tr. 39 \u2013 42) \n \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.d is for a delinquent utility account. Applicant has been making \n$100 payments on that debt each month since April 2018. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX A; \nAX P; Tr. 39 \u2013 43) \n \n \nThe medical debts at SOR 1.e, 1.g, and 1.j are being addressed as one \nconsolidated debt. Applicant has made monthly $100 payments since April 2018. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX B; AX C; AX L; Tr. 43 \u2013 44, 49, 50 \u2013 52) \n \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.f is for the balance remaining after resale of a car that was \nrepossessed in 2011. Applicant has not resolved this debt. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX N; \n44 \u2013 47, 65 \u2013 66) \n \n \nAvailable information shows that the debts at SOR 1.h and 1.i are for the same \ndelinquent cable television account. Applicant presented information showing the debt \nhas been paid. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; AX O; Tr. 50) \n \n \nAppellant attributes his unpaid debts to expenses arising from his second divorce \nin 2010. Thereafter, he endured periods of unemployment between 2013 and 2015 that \ninterrupted his efforts to resolve his debts and further exacerbated his financial problems. \nHe was unaware of several of the debts alleged in the SOR until he was interviewed by \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \na government investigator in December 2017. His efforts to pay his debts did not begin in \nearnest until April 2018 because he did not have enough money saved up to make \npayments. The largest of his unresolved debts is for the remainder after resale of a car \nthat was repossessed in 2011, around the time of his second divorce. Applicant believed \nat the time that he had no further obligation, but he has recently attempted to correspond \nwith that creditor (SOR 1.f) to make repayment arrangements. In addition to the debt \nresolution progress reflected in his response to the SOR and in his hearing exhibits, \nApplicant has enlisted the services of a credit counseling service through which he \nintends to clear up inaccuracies in his credit history and to negotiate repayments with his \nremaining creditors. (Answer; AX N; AX Q; Tr. 26 \u2013 27, 44 \u2013 47, 53 \u2013 55, 65 \u2013 66) \n \n \nApplicant and his third wife manage their finances together. Because her income \nis substantially more than his, he provides his income to her to cover the expenses she \ndoes not pay. Credit reports show that Applicant has not incurred any new debts since \n2016, and Applicant files and pays his federal and state income taxes as required. (GX \n2; GX 3; Tr. 28 \u2013 30, 58 \u2013 76) \n \n \nApplicant was candid and straightforward in his testimony. He appeared earnest \nin his desire to continue resolving his remaining debts and improve his finances. Applicant \nhas a good reputation at work for reliability, hard work, and honesty. (AX H; AX I) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of \nthe guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n                                                 \n4 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $20,371. As of the close of the adjudication of the information obtained in his \nbackground investigation, much of that debt remained unresolved. That information \nreasonably raises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \n\u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n                                                 \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n7 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following \nAG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s debts arose from or were exacerbated by his second \ndivorce and a subsequent period of unemployment. He has acted responsibly in the last \ntwo years to resolve his debts, some of which he was not aware of until early 2018. \nApplicant has since has paid or otherwise resolved, through settlements or ongoing \npayment plans, the debts at SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g \u2013 1.j. He also has sought, albeit \nrecently, professional assistance in resolving his remaining debts and addressing \ninaccurate information in his credit history. Further, Applicant and his wife manage their \nfinances in a prudent manner, they live entirely within their means, and they have incurred \nno new past-due or delinquent debts. The foregoing supports application of the following \nAG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s performance and \nreputation in the workplace. Applicant was candid about his efforts to resolve his debts, \nand it appears he and his wife manage their finances so as to avoid future unpaid or past-\ndue debts. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows \nthe security concerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The evidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. He voluntarily reported the derogatory information \nand was truthful and complete in responding to questions during the security clearance \nprocess. His substance misuse ended nearly two years ago in late 2016, and he has no \nintention to engage in similar behavior in the future. Accordingly, this case is decided for \nApplicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format) on February 26, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly \nknown as a security clearance application. Thereafter, on March 16, 2018, after \nreviewing the application and the information gathered during a background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort \nMeade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was \nunable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \n\n \n2 \n \neligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 3, 2018, with a four-page memorandum. \nHe admitted the SOR allegations under Guideline H and provided explanatory \ninformation. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.   \n \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 16, 2018, and \nthen reassigned to me on May 22, 2018. The hearing was conducted as scheduled on \nSeptember 18, 2018. Department Counsel offered a documentary exhibit, which was \nadmitted as Exhibit 1. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as \nExhibits A-F. He called one witness, and he relied on his own testimony. The hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on September 25, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to provide an additional document; \nnamely, a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. He made a timely submission on September 19, 2018, and it is admitted \nwithout objections as Exhibit G.  \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. He is employed as a software engineer by a company \nworking in the defense industry. He has been so employed since February 2017. He \nhas a good employment record with his current employer and is held in high regard \naccording to letters of recommendation from a supervisor and co-worker. (Exhibits C \nand D) His educational background includes an associate\u2019s degree in applied science \nawarded in 2004, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science, magna cum laude, \nawarded in 2007. He has had full-time employment as a software engineer since 2007. \nHe has no military service. He has been a homeowner since 2009. He has never \nmarried and has no children.  \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits a history of drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse from about August 2009 to about July 2016. He disclosed these \nmatters in his February 2017 security clearance application, which forms the basis for \nthe SOR allegations. He had a five-year relationship with a woman whom he thought he \nwould marry, and most of his drug use occurred with her. He has since severed his ties \nto her, separating in March 2017. (Tr. 2017) He did not list her as a cohabitant in his \nFebruary 2017 security clearance application.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse consist of the following:  \n \n\uf0b7 He used marijuana with varying frequency, about once every six months, \nduring the 2009-2016 period. He used occasionally when friends offered it \nto him. He did not purchase or seek out marijuana for his use. He has not \nused marijuana since late 2016 (New Year\u2019s Eve). He typically used it on \n\n \n3 \n \noccasions such as camping or climbing trips. He has no intention to use \nmarijuana again.  \n \n\uf0b7 He used cocaine twice with his former girlfriend during the April 2013 to \nFebruary 2016 period. He never purchased cocaine or sought it out. He \nwas wary of it due to its addictive qualities. He was interested in cocaine \nfor experimental use and had no intention to use it regularly. He has no \nintention to use cocaine again.  \n \n \n\uf0b7 He provided the prescription medication Xanax to a friend on multiple \noccasions during 2013-2016. His friend suffered from stress and anxiety \non occasion, and he provided small amounts of Xanax about once a year \nduring this period. He has no intention of engaging in similar behavior.  \n\uf0b7 He used a prescription muscle relaxer, not prescribed to him, with varying \nfrequency during 2013-2016. He has a chronic back problem that causes \nhim pain periodically. He mentioned his back problem to a friend and the \nfriend offered the muscle relaxer to him. He later consulted a physician \nwho prescribed the same medication for him. He has no intention of \nengaging in similar behavior.  \n \nApplicant knows that his employer has a drug-free workplace policy, and he was \nrequired to pass a pre-employment drug test as a condition of employment. (Tr. 52) He \nalso knows that any substance misuse, including marijuana use, is off limits as a \ncleared employee regardless of the laws of any state. (Tr. 49-55) He reaffirmed his \nintention to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse in his post-\nhearing signed statement of intent. (Exhibit G). He also acknowledged that any further \ndrug involvement or substance misuse may be grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility. (Exhibit G)  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern is \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:  \n \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate laws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \n                                                          \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E.3.1.15. \n\n \n5 \n \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia;  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, which began in 2009 and ended several years later in late 2016. Most of his \nmarijuana use and his twice-use of cocaine occurred during a long-term relationship \nwith a former girlfriend, which ended in separation in about March 2017. His \ninvolvement with Xanax and the muscle relaxer, as described in the findings of fact, was \nnot trivial, but I view his marijuana and cocaine use as the more serious matters. Any \nillegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s security worthiness. \nHis use of marijuana, in particular, is significant because it occurred on a periodic basis \nover a period of years. It was not a mere lapse in judgment or an isolated incident, as \nshown by the frequency and duration of his use. Moreover, Applicant was not a youthful \ncollege-aged student, as all of his substance misuse occurred when he was working as \na software engineer. These matters militate against a favorable clearance decision.  \n \n \nNevertheless, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is now safely in the past. It ended in late 2016, when he used marijuana at a \nNew Year\u2019s Eve party, which is nearly two years before the record closed here in \nSeptember 2018. In other words, his drug misconduct is not recent. He voluntarily \nreported the derogatory information about his drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand he was truthful and complete in responding to questions during the security \nclearance process. He has had no illegal drug involvement or substance misuse during \nhis employment in the defense industry. He has a good employment record in the \n\n \n6 \n \ndefense industry, and he desires to continue that employment. I am satisfied that \nApplicant will continue to adhere to his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy, that he \nwill adhere to federal law concerning marijuana use, and that he will abstain from any \nfurther illegal drug involvement or substance misuse.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I \nconclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant admitted those allegations. \n(Answer \u00b6\u00b6 H.a-c.) \n \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR made two allegations: (1) in April 2017, Applicant was \narrested and charged with DUI, careless driving and speeding, and was sentenced to 20 \ndays in jail (suspended) and three years of unsupervised probation; (2) Applicant is \ncurrently on probation until August 2020. (SOR \u00b6 2.) Applicant admitted those allegations. \n(Answer \u00b6\u00b6 J.a-b.) \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR made four allegations: (1) it repleaded the allegations \nunder Guidelines H and J; (2) Applicant falsified her July 21, 2017 e-QIP by answering \n\u201cNo\u201d to the question about any illegal drug use in the past seven years; (3) Applicant \nfalsified her July 21, 2017 e-QIP by answering \u201cNo\u201d to the question about ever using illegal \ndrugs while holding a security clearance. (SOR \u00b6 3.) Applicant admitted those allegations \nbut claimed that she did not deliberately falsify her e-QIP answers and that her answers \nwere negligent and unintentional. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 E.c-d.) \n \nApplicant testified about her use of marijuana. She started using marijuana in \nabout 2010 with a friend who lived nearby. Applicant\u2019s friend used it for migraine \nheadaches and recommended it to Applicant. At that time, Applicant suffered from \nmigraine headaches that were caused by a jet ski accident in 2008 or 2009. Applicant \nwent to physical therapy, but it did not help. Before she tried marijuana, Applicant dealt \nwith her migraines by going into a closet with the lights off. Her migraines were fairly \ndebilitating, so she thought she would try marijuana. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana varied \n\n3 \n \nwith the severity of the migraines, at most two to three times a month but not consistently. \nThe worse the migraines, the more she would use marijuana. Applicant was desperate, \nand the marijuana was very effective. Applicant last used marijuana in September 2017. \nShe never sought medical marijuana or any prescription medicine for her migraines \nbecause of the history of drug abuse among her family members. Applicant never \npurchased marijuana; her friend would give her whatever she needed. She still sees her \nfriend, but only occasionally. Applicant still has migraines, but she now treats her \nmigraines by going into the closet, but with Excedrin instead of marijuana. (Tr. 24-30, 42-\n43, 49-52.) \nApplicant learned while in the Air Force that the use of marijuana was illegal and \nthat using marijuana violated her security clearance. She also knew in 2010 when she \nbegan using marijuana that it was illegal and violated her security clearance.  Applicant \nhas had a clearance since 2002, and it got renewed in about 2012 or 2013. She had been \nusing marijuana for two to three years before that renewal. When she filled out her form \nfor that renewal, Applicant did not admit that she had been using marijuana. In the 2012 \nor 2013 time frame, when she was getting her clearance renewed, she kept smoking \nmarijuana. When filling out her renewal application in 2012 or 2013 and the July 2017 \n application (alleged in the SOR), Applicant just skimmed through the clearance \napplication questions about illegal drug usage. She has \u201cheavy drug users\u201d in her family \nbut did not consider herself to be a drug user. At the time of completing the clearance \napplications, Applicant did not understand that her answers of \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23 \nquestions about illegal drug usage were false. She does understand that now and testified \nthat she answered \u201cNo\u201d falsely four times (two in 2012/2013 and two in 2017). Applicant \ntestified that she was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d addicted to marijuana and has had no withdrawal \nsymptoms of any type since her last use of marijuana in September 2017. (Tr. 24-32, 43.) \nApplicant testified about her DUI arrest in April 2017. She had gone to an \nestablishment and had one shot and one-and-a-half beers over three hours. She did not \nfinish her second beer. Applicant thought she had been drinking responsibly and did not \nfeel inebriated. She knew that she would be the driver that evening. Applicant was pulled \nover for speeding. Her passenger was a friend who had also been drinking. The officer \nsaid he could smell alcohol and gave Applicant a breathalyzer test, which she failed. \nApplicant self-reported this incident to her employer a couple of weeks later, although she \nspoke directly to her supervisor about it shortly afterwards. Her supervisor gave her \ninstructions about whom she was supposed to report to at the company. Applicant waited \na couple of weeks to report, because she was nervous and worried about \u201cfallout.\u201d As a \nresult of the April 2017 DUI, Applicant was enrolled in an early intervention program for \nalcohol abuse in August 2017. She continued to use marijuana and tested positive for \nmarijuana in that intervention program in August 2017 and October 2017. Applicant did \nnot complete that program due to a death in the family. In 2018, she enrolled in a \nsubstance abuse program, as ordered in her sentence. The program ran 13 weeks, one \nhour per week in group sessions. Applicant submitted post-hearing the weekly urinalysis \nresults from April 30, 2018 to October 29, 2018. All results were negative for alcohol and \nmarijuana and other controlled substances. Although she was still using marijuana when \nshe reported her DUI to her employer in May 2017, Applicant did not report her marijuana \n\n4 \n \nusage. She is a social drinker, but she does not drink very often, perhaps once or twice \na month. Applicant is on unsupervised probation until August 2020. (Tr. 32-48; AE A; AE \nB.) \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Individuals are eligible for access to classified \ninformation \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to \nauthorize such access. E.O. 10865 \u00a7 2; SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The \nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human \nbehavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, \nconsidering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial \ndecision. SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(c), 2(d). \n \nDepartment Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nAdministrative Judges are responsible for ensuring that an applicant receives fair \nnotice of the issues raised, has a reasonable opportunity to litigate those issues, and is \nnot subjected to unfair surprise. ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). \nIn resolving the ultimate question regarding an applicant\u2019s eligibility, \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d SEAD-4, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(b). See also SEAD-4, \u00b6 E.4. \nMoreover, the Supreme Court has held that officials making \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain \ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of \ncompromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \n \n \nUnder AG H for drug use, suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put into \ndoubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to with laws, rules and regulations: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or \nmental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such \nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 \nU.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25 and 26 (setting forth the concern and \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions).) \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b)  testing positive for an illegal drug;  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance\u2026; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information.  \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for drug involvement under \nAG \u00b6 26 and found the following relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and, \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited \nto: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and, (3) \n\n6 \n \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \nApplicant admitted her use of marijuana from 2010 until September 2017, and that \nher use occurred while she held a security clearance. Facts admitted by an applicant in \nan answer to an SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-\n1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (\u201cany admissions [applicant] made to the SOR \nallegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof\u201d); ISCR Case No. 94-\n0569 at 4 and n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (\u201c[a]n applicant\u2019s admissions, whether \ntestimonial or written, can provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge\u2019s findings\u201d).   \n \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and its possession is regulated by \nthe federal government under the Controlled Substances Act.  21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq.   \nIn an October 25, 2014, memorandum, the Director of National Intelligence reaffirmed \nthat the use of marijuana is relevant to national security determinations, regardless of \nchanges to state laws concerning marijuana use. James R. Clapper, Director of National \nIntelligence, Memorandum: Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use \n(October 25, 2014). AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), (b), (c), and (f) apply. \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions cited above and find that they do not \napply. First, the 2017 last use of marijuana while holding a clearance is not so long ago  \nto negate security concerns. Second, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana was not infrequent. It \nwas several times a month depending on the frequency and severity of her migraines. \nFinally, Applicant has not presented a long enough track record of abstinence to mitigate \nthe security concern caused by her illegal drug usage. Therefore, I find against Applicant \non SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, and c.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe criminal conduct security concern is detailed in AG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following \napply: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \n(c)  individual is currently on parole or probation.  \n \n\n7 \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrest and conviction of DUI in April 2017 trigger security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and (c). The question is whether Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her criminal conduct.  \n \nThe potentially mitigating conditions are set forth in AG \u00b6 32 as follows:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(c) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n Applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction of DUI in April 2017 cannot be mitigated by the \npassage of time, just over two years. In addition, Applicant will be on probation until \nAugust 2020. It is true that she successfully completed a substance abuse program. I \nfind, however, that Applicant needs to present a longer track record of no criminal \nincidents. Since she testified that she only drinks occasionally, it would appear that \nApplicant is capable of developing such a track record. On this record, however, I find \nagainst Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and b.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \n AG \u00b6 15 sets forth the general concern based on personal conduct that is relevant \nin this case:  \n \n \n Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) provides the specific disqualifying condition that is potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer\u2026. \n \n\n8 \n \n \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose in her \nJuly 21, 2017 security clearance application that she had used marijuana while \npossessing a security clearance. Applicant admitted that omission in her answer to the \nSOR and in her hearing testimony. She also admitted at the hearing that she failed to \ndisclose that information during her clearance renewal process in 2012 or 2013. Because \nthe Government did not move to amend the SOR to add that allegation, I may only \nconsider that non-alleged conduct to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, to evaluate her case \nfor mitigation, or to perform a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 14-01941 at 3 (App. \nBd. Mar. 30, 2015).  \n \n A statement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately (knowingly and \nwillfully). An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if, for example, \nthe person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the \nquestion, reasonably did not know the information, or genuinely thought the information \ndid not need to be reported. In assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider \nnot only the allegation and Applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances, with \nparticular scrutiny of Applicant\u2019s state of mind or intent. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors).)  \n \nApplicant has had a security clearance since she joined the Air Force in 2002. She \nrenewed that clearance in 2012 or 2013, and again in 2017. Applicant is not new to the \nsecurity clearance process and reporting requirements for incidents that may trigger \nsecurity concerns. In fact, Applicant knew that she was required to report her April 2017 \nDUI to her employer. At the same time, she did not report her periodic usage of marijuana, \nwhich had been reportable since she began using in 2010. None of Applicant\u2019s \nexplanations were sufficient to justify omitting her illegal drug usage from the July 21, \n2017 security clearance application. I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3. \n \nConclusion \n \nThe record raises doubts about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):                 Against Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \n \n \n \n    Against Applicant \n\n9 \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):      \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n    Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \n \n \n    Against Applicant  \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \n    Against Applicant \n    \n   Subparagraphs 3.a-3.d:  \n \n                          Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nPhilip J.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 22, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on December 5, \n2018. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n03/18/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 7. Applicant submitted a timely response and \nhis exhibit is marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections by Applicant \nor Department Counsel and all Items and AE A are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on February 27, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except \u00b6 1.b, which he believed was \na duplicate with \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He holds an associate\u2019s degree. He served in the Army \nand was honorably discharged. He married in 1984 and has four children, ages 33, 31, \n25, and 22. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since April \n2016.1 \n \nApplicant disclosed on his August 2016 security clearance application (SCA) that \nhe was unemployed December 2015 to January 2016; September 2013 to January 2014; \nand July 2009 to November 2009. He explained in his answer to the SOR that he worked \nas a independent contractor and could not control the duration of the contracts, \nunexpected cancelations, and whether the contract was renewed. When he was not \nworking on a contract, it impacted his finances. He also explained that he earned more \nmoney when he worked as a independent contractor. He has decided to work in a job \nwhere he receives a regular salary, where he earns less money than when he worked \nindependently, but he receives a consistent salary with benefits.2  \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from September 2016 and February \n2018, corroborate the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.3 \n \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer and provided documents to show that in May \n2018, he sought financial assistance with a debt solution company. The company \nprovided him a proposed plan to pay his delinquent debs. Not all of the SOR debts were \nincluded in the plan. There is no evidence that Applicant has implemented the plan and \nmade any monthly payments towards resolution of the debts that are alleged in the SOR.4 \n \nApplicant stated in his answer that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($15,464) is for a \nrepossessed vehicle. He purchased the vehicle in March 2013, and he fell behind on his \nmonthly payments in about September 2013, because he was in between contracts and \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Items 3, 4. \n \n3 Items 3, 5, 6, 7. \n \n4 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nunemployed. He attempted to catch up payments for the two delinquent months, but the \ncreditor refused to accept his payments and repossessed the vehicle. Apparently, \nApplicant had an unpleasant encounter with the creditor. In his FORM response, he said \nhe contacted the creditor and was told the account was past the time to collect, and he \nshould leave it alone. It is unknown what this advice means, other than to wait until the \nstatute of limitation runs. In his FORM response, he said that he received a letter \nindicating there was a lawsuit against this creditor for devious practices. No other \ninformation or documents were provided.5 This debt is not resolved.  \n \nApplicant indicated that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,364) is a duplicate of \u00b6 1.c \n($974). In the Government\u2019s FORM, it advised Applicant that the two allegations were not \nthe same debt and the credit reports reflect they are different accounts. Applicant \nindicated he was working with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He did not provide documentation \nthat he has a payment plan, has resolved either of these debts, or substantiated the debts \nare duplicates. These debts are not resolved.6  \n \n \nApplicant had a dispute with the merchant in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($242). He felt he was \ntreated badly when he tried to return merchandise. The debt was charged off in December \n2011. He stated that when he contacted the creditor that holds the account, he was \nadvised the account is past the statute of limitation. The debt is unresolved.7  \n \n \nApplicant was told that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,140), which was a consumer \naccount, is past the statute of limitations, and he was advised to leave it alone. It is \nunresolved.8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,230) does not articulate whether he has \nresolved the account. He wrote \u201csettlement $1,230,\u201d but failed to provide information that \nshows he has paid the debt or reached a settlement agreement that he has paid. It is \nunresolved.9 \n \n \nApplicant indicated that with the help of his credit counselor, he is still working to \nresolve the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($384), a cell phone account. He did not provide any other \ninformation or documentary evidence. It is unresolved.10  \n \n                                                          \n5 Items 3, 5: AE A. \n \n6 Items 3, 6, 7. \n \n7 Items 3, 5, 6, 7. \n \n8 Items 3, 5, 6, 7. \n \n9 Item 3.  \n \n10 Items 3, 5, 6, 7. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant stated in his answer to the SOR that he paid the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.h ($160) that was in collection. He did not provide documentary evidence to show it is \npaid. It is unresolved.11  \n \nApplicant said that he attempted to speak to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($57). He \nsaid the creditor told him it did not have his social security number showing he had a debt. \nApplicant did not provide documentary evidence to show he has disputed the debt. It is \nnot resolved.12  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s FORM response he provided a document to show he paid a medical \ncollection account in January 2019. It appears this debt was not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant stated that he is not irresponsible or in financial \u201cbad shape.\u201d He provided \nfinancial documents to corroborate his statement. He said and the documents support \nthat as of January 2019, he had approximately $18,657 in one of his bank accounts; \n$5,723 in another account; approximately $30,000 in a 401k pension plan; and about \n$32,290 in stock options that will vest in about a year. Applicant further stated that he \nowns a home and has a second investment home.13  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n                                                          \n11 Items 3, 5, 6, 7. \n \n12 Items 3, 5, 6, 7. \n \n13 AE A. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts dating back to approximately 2011 that \nare unresolved. He provided evidence that he has the financial means to resolve at least \nsome of the debts, but did not provide evidence that he has done so. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant has not paid or provided evidence that he has resolved any of the debts \nalleged in the SOR. His delinquent debts are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment and to the \nunreliability of working on government contracts. The unemployment periods were \nsomewhat beyond his control. Applicant was aware of the positive aspect of working as \nan independent contractor, which is higher pay, and the negative aspect, which is \nunreliability. Choosing to work as an independent contractor was within his control \nbecause he could have better planned for periods he was unemployed and not being \n\n \n7 \n \n \npaid, while waiting for a new contract. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly. Applicant did not provided sufficient evidence to show he \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances. He failed to provide documentary \nevidence to support that he has resolved any of his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has \npartial application.  \n \n \nThere is evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. He did not provide \nevidence that his financial problems are under control. There is no evidence he is making \ngood-faith efforts to pay the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and \n20(d) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant disputed some debts, but did not provide documentary evidence of the \nlegitimacy of his disputes or evidence of actions he has taken to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He has worked as a government contractor, which due \nto the nature of business, he was unemployed in between contracts. He contracted with \na debt solution company in May 2018, but failed to provide evidence that he has made \nmonthly payments into the plan to resolve some of his debts. Not all of his delinquent \ndebts were included in the plan. Regarding some of his delinquent debts, it appears he is \nrelying on the statute of limitations to resolve them. The Appeal Board has held that debts \n\n \n8 \n \n \nbeyond the statute of limitation for collections cannot be mitigated solely because they \nare not collectable.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board reinforced its position on statutes of limitations not \nmitigating financial considerations concerns stating: \n \nIn this case, the Judge noted that Applicant explained that he did not owe \nany of the alleged debts because they had either been deleted from his \ncredit report or soon would be deleted, and he also relied on a state statute \nof limitations to absolve himself of debts. The Appeal Board has long \nrecognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance purposes even \nif they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the statute of \nlimitations or cannot be legally listed on a credit report due to the passage \nof time. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) \nand ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006). We also have \nheld that reliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not constitute a \ngood-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is of limited mitigative \nvalue. ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005) and ISCR Case No. 01-\n09691 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003)).14 \n \n \nApplicant provided evidence that he has the financial resources to resolve his \ndelinquent debts, but failed to provide documentary evidence that he has done so. He \nhas not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n14 ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \n01/10/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance.1 \n \n \nOn March 23, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on August 9, 2018, and convened the requested hearing on \nNovember 29, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) \nA and B. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed the IRS $22,167 for \nunpaid taxes in the 2012 tax year (SOR 1.a), and $28,175 for unpaid taxes in the 2013 \ntax year (SOR 1.b), with the $50,342 total debt being preserved through a single tax lien \nentered against Applicant in September 2016. It was further alleged that Applicant owed \n$1,605 for an unpaid medical account (SOR 1.c). In response, Applicant admitted all three \nallegations, and he provided explanations and supporting documents. (Answer) In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.c, Applicant disputed this debt during his November 14, 2017 \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator. At hearing, Applicant \npresented information that shows this debt has been satisfied. SOR 1.c is resolved for \nApplicant. (Answer; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 11 \u2013 12) \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and works as an instructor for a federal contractor, where \nhe has been employed since September 2015. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from \nJanuary 1992 until July 1995, when he received an honorable discharge for medical \nreasons. Applicant has held a security clearance since early 1992. He and his wife have \nbeen married since September 2013 and have one child together. Applicant was married \ntwice previously and has one adult child from his first marriage. (GX 1)  \n \n \nFrom August 2005 until September 2015, Applicant worked for two different federal \ncontractors providing security for overseas diplomatic personnel. During that time, he \nlived and worked overseas on a nearly permanent basis. Most years during that period, \nApplicant qualified for exemption from federal income tax of the first $97,000 of his annual \nincome. Each year he used a certified public accountant (CPA) to prepare and file his \nreturns and to assist him in resolving any discrepancies that might arise with regard to his \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nfederal and state income taxes. Applicant has always timely complied with his income \nreporting and payment obligations. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 34 \u2013 35, 38, 40 \u2013 41) \n \n \nIn 2014, the IRS audited Applicant\u2019s taxes for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. Based \non that audit, the IRS retroactively disallowed large portions of Applicant\u2019s claimed \noverseas income tax exemptions and determined that he owed the taxes alleged in SOR \n1.a and 1.b. Applicant contacted his CPA and they notified the IRS of their intent to appeal \nthe audit findings in federal tax court. After being given a court date, a deadline was set \nfor submitting information in support of Applicant\u2019s appeal. At the time the court date and \nfiling deadlines were established, Applicant had been in the United States on medical \nleave for about two months. However, the notice of his court date and the filing deadline \nwere sent to his overseas address. By the time Applicant became aware of the deadline, \nhe was unable to timely submit the necessary information. As a result, his appeal was \ndenied. Subsequently, the IRS perfected a single lien of $50,342 against Applicant to \npreserve the IRS\u2019 claim against him. The lien was obtained in September 2016, but \nApplicant did not become aware of it until January 2017. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 26 \u2013 \n28, 30 \u2013 33, 45 \u2013 46) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances are otherwise sound. Available information shows that he is \ncurrently carrying more credit card debt than he would prefer, he attributes those \nexpenditures to unexpected repairs needed on a home he and his wife recently \npurchased. Aside from the liens documented in his credit report, all of his debts are in \ngood standing. Applicant averred that the only reason the IRS obtained these liens is that \nhe missed his filing deadline through no fault of his own. He is confident they will be \nresolved in his favor, but cannot say when that will happen. In response to the IRS\u2019 action, \nApplicant and his CPA have been working to resolve Applicant\u2019s tax debts through the \nTaxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) within the IRS. One of the TAS representatives \nadvised Applicant on March 8, 2018, that Applicant\u2019s case had an estimated resolution \ndate of May 22, 2018. On October 4, 2018, Applicant\u2019s case was still pending and another \nTAS representative advised that additional time would be needed to resolve the case and \nthat Applicant would be notified of the status of his case by November 1, 2018. No \nadditional information has been forthcoming from TAS. (Answer; AX B; Tr. 35 \u2013 37, 51 \u2013 \n52) \n \n \nApplicant believes that the IRS does not plan to levy any of his pay or assets to \nenforce the liens against him. In the event he does not prevail in having the liens released \nand the debts extinguished, Applicant will pursue one of two paths to resolve any \nremaining debt. He might negotiate a settlement for a lesser amount he could pay off in \nmonthly installments. Alternatively, in most of the years he worked overseas, he received \nper diem benefits that were not taxable. Nonetheless, he declared that money as income \nout of a sense of obligation. In order to reduce his tax obligations for 2012 and 2013, his \nCPA has suggested that he could refile those returns without the previously declared per \ndiem so as to reduce his overall tax for those years. Theoretically, this would reduce his \ntax debts that would be subject to the results of the 2014 audit. Regardless of which \nresolution he might pursue, available information shows Applicant has sufficient income \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nand monthly net cash flow to resolve the liens, should a final determination be made \nagainst him. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 29 \u2013 30, 39 \u2013 40, 46 \u2013 48) \n \n \nApplicant excelled in his work overseas between 2005 and 2015. He now works in \nthe United States and has continued his outstanding performance. He returned from \noverseas in September 2015 after being injured, and he does not plan on returning to \noverseas assignments with his current employer. (Answer; Tr. 33 \u2013 35, 44) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,2 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \n                                                 \n2 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that in 2016, the IRS obtained a lien against \nApplicant for $50,342 for unpaid taxes from 2012 and 2013. Available information also \ndocumented an unpaid $1,605 medical debt attributed to Applicant; however, that debt \nwas timely resolved. Because the tax lien has not been resolved, available information \nreasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \n\u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nIn this case, there is no indication that Applicant has ever failed to file his returns; rather, \nthe focus is on an alleged failure to pay what he was obligated to pay. \n \n \nThe debt in question is based on a 2014 audit of Applicant\u2019s 2012 and 2013 federal \nincome tax returns. Specifically, the IRS retroactively disallowed significant claims for \nexemptions based on Applicant\u2019s residence and work status for two of the ten years he \n                                                 \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nspent employed by a federal contractor overseas. The lien for those taxes was obtained \nafter Applicant missed a filing deadline for appealing the results of the audit. The IRS has \nnot levied the lien against Applicant\u2019s income or assets, and Applicant has been \nnegotiating in good faith with the IRS to resolve the status of his 2012 and 2013 taxes to \nthe best of his ability. That process is still ongoing and it does not appear that a final \ndecision has been made that Applicant will have to pay the amounts specified in the lien. \nEven if he is ultimately determined to be liable for those taxes, he has the means and a \nplan for resolving such a debt. All available information about Applicant\u2019s finances shows \nthey are sound and that he will resolve any tax liabilities in a prompt and reasonable \nmanner. All of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAdditionally, I considered the applicability of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(g) \n(the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the \namount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements). Strictly speaking, it is \npremature to apply this mitigating condition, because Applicant has always filed his \nreturns as required, and it as it has not yet been determined what taxes, if any, Applicant \nhas to pay. But consistent with his ongoing contacts with the IRS and with my previous \nobservations about the strength of his current finances, it is reasonable to conclude that \nhe will comply with any future arrangements needed to resolve this matter. On balance, I \nconclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised in the \nSOR. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s performance and \nreputation in the workplace. Applicant was candid about his efforts to resolve his tax lien, \nand his explanation of what occurred was plausible. A fair and commonsense assessment \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nof the record evidence as a whole shows the security concerns about his finances are \nmitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Item 1.) In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that she purchased and used marijuana between the dates of January 2014 and May 2017, but only during two discrete periods: in January 2014, when she experimented with the drug occasionally after it became legal in her state, and in May 2017 to cope with several life stressors, including the breakup with her then fianc\u00e9, the flooding of her apartment, and an impending layoff. Applicant admitted to a lapse of judgment in using marijuana while she held an interim clearance, but asked that the fact that she self-reported the information be considered in mitigation. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 3), I make the following findings of fact: 3 Applicant is 34 years old and unmarried.

After being granted an interim \nSecret clearance and after stating that she did not intend to use marijuana in the future, \nshe turned to marijuana in 2017 to cope with anxiety and depression after breaking up with \nher fianc\u00e9. She has not used any marijuana since May 2017, but her marijuana use in \ncontravention of the federal drug laws and security requirements raises doubts about her \nreform. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The SOR explained why the \nDOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue security clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \n\n2 \n \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June \n8, 2017. \n \nOn July 6, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). Department Counsel for the Government prepared an \nundated File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of five exhibits (Items 1-5) and six \ndocuments (Items 6-11) for administrative notice. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant on October 17, 2018, and instructed her to file any objections to the information \nor to supply additional information in response to the FORM within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on October 25, 2018. No response was received by \nNovember 24, 2018. On January 30, 2019, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. I received the case assignment on February 4, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \n  \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel requested administrative notice of the federal \ngovernment\u2019s official policy with regard to the use of marijuana, which remains a Schedule \nI controlled drug, as set forth in Items 6 through 11 of the FORM. Applicant submitted no \ncomment or objection. Accordingly, memoranda from the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s \nDeputy Attorney General (Items 6-9), the Director of National Intelligence (Item 10), and \nthe Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) (Item 11), were reviewed and \nadministrative notice was taken of the fact that marijuana use remains illegal under federal \nlaw and prohibited by federal policy. \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant purchased and used marijuana \nwith varying frequency from approximately January 2014 through May 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand that Applicant continued to use and purchase marijuana after she had been granted a \nDOD interim secret clearance in October 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Item 1.) In her Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted that she purchased and used marijuana between the dates of \nJanuary 2014 and May 2017, but only during two discrete periods: in January 2014, when \nshe experimented with the drug occasionally after it became legal in her state, and in May \n2017 to cope with several life stressors, including the breakup with her then fianc\u00e9, the \nflooding of her apartment, and an impending layoff. Applicant admitted to a lapse of \njudgment in using marijuana while she held an interim clearance, but asked that the fact \nthat she self-reported the information be considered in mitigation. \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 3), \nI make the following findings of fact: \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant is 34 years old and unmarried. She has an associate\u2019s degree in criminal \njustice awarded in May 2009 and additional college credits earned between January 2011 \nand August 2012. She has been employed as a security analyst with a defense contractor \nsince June 2016, and in October 2016, she was granted an interim Secret security \nclearance. (Items 3-5.) \n \nApplicant worked as a fraud agent in the online payment sector from February 2008 \nto September 2013. She left the job voluntarily to move to her current state of residence. \nFrom November 2013 to April 2015, she worked as a project manager for a start-up \ncompany involved in service delivery management. After recreational use of marijuana \nbecame legal in the state,1 Applicant purchased marijuana from a state-licensed \ndispensary, and she used the drug \u201cthrough the month\u201d of January 2014 into February \n2014. (Items 3-5.) Her stated reason for using the drug was that it became legal to do so. \n(Item 4.) \n \nFrom April 2015 to June 2016, Applicant was employed as an investigator for a \nfinancial investment company. She left for a higher-paying position with her current \nemployer in June 2016. On August 23, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions2 (SF 86) on which she \nresponded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether she had illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances in the last seven years. She disclosed that she purchased and \nsmoked marijuana from January 2014 to February 2014 after marijuana use became legal \nin her state. She responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether she intended to use marijuana in the future, \nand stated, \u201cI do not intend to use this drug in the future as the decision to purchase and \nsmoke marijuana was only related to the passing of the law making it legal.\u201d (Item 4.) \n \n                                                 \n1 Effective December 2012, the state legalized the recreational use of marijuana for persons 21 years or older. \nPossession, using, displaying, purchasing, or transporting marijuana accessories or one ounce or less of \nmarijuana is not considered unlawful. Retail establishments for the sale of marijuana have been operating \nsince January 2014. Selling, distributing, or transferring marijuana to individuals under age 21, and driving \nunder the influence of marijuana remain illegal. Under Section 18-18-406 of the pertinent state statutes, \npossession of more than 12 ounces of marijuana or more than three ounces of marijuana concentrate is a \nlevel 4 drug felony. Possession of more than six ounces but less than 12 ounces of marijuana or not more \nthan three ounces of marijuana concentrate is a level 1 drug misdemeanor. Possession of more than two \nounces but not more than six ounces of marijuana is a level 2 drug misdemeanor. Possession of not more \nthan two ounces of marijuana is a drug petty offense punishable by a fine of not more than $100. Open and \npublic display, consumption, or use of two ounces or less of marijuana is a drug petty offense punishable by a \nfine of up to $100 and up to 24 hours of community service. There is an exception from criminal prosecution \nunder \u00a7 18-1-711 for any person who suffers or reports an emergency drug overdose event. Transferring or \ndispensing not more than two ounces of marijuana from one person to another for no consideration is \nconsidered a drug petty offense and not a sale. However, it is unlawful (a level 1 drug misdemeanor) for a \nperson to transfer marijuana at no cost if the transfer is related in any way to remuneration for a product or \nservice. \n \n2 The SF 86 in the FORM (Item 4) is missing pages 30 and 31 involving section 22 inquiries concerning police \nrecord information. There are no SOR allegations pertaining to a police record. \n \n\n4 \n \nApplicant turned to marijuana in 2017, perhaps as early as January 2017,3 to cope \nwith anxiety and depression after breaking up with her fianc\u00e9. She purchased marijuana \nfrom a legal dispensary and used the drug approximately twice a week for about five weeks \nfrom April 2017 to May 2017. (Items 3, 5.) \n \nOn September 22, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Regarding any illegal use of drugs in the last \nseven years, Applicant reportedly disclosed that she used marijuana throughout the month \nof January 2014; randomly since then; and about twice a week between April 2017 and \nMay 2017. She attributed her 2014 use of marijuana to its legalization and her recent use \nto coping with anxiety after breaking up with her now former fianc\u00e9. She bought the \nmarijuana for her personal use from a dispensary and smoked it alone at home. She \nexpressed her belief that she had matured since then. She denied any intention to use \nmarijuana again because she has acquired better coping skills like yoga and meditation \nand because she did not want to jeopardize her current employment with a defense \ncontractor. (Item 5.) \n \nOn March 26, 2018, DOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant. She indicated in \nresponse on May 5, 2018, that she was in the process of being weaned from an anti-\ndepressant medication under the care of her physician. Asked to list any involvement with \nnon-prescribed drugs since January 1, 2014, Applicant reported that she used marijuana \nabout ten times from April 2017 to May 2017 and that she had purchased the marijuana \nfrom a licensed dispensary. Applicant indicated that she had stopped using illegal drugs in \nMay 2017; that she has no unused drugs or paraphernalia in her possession; and that she \ndoes not associate with any persons who use illegal drugs or frequent places where she \nhas reason to believe drugs are being used or are used in her presence. Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the report of her interview with the OPM investigator. She made no \ncorrections to the information reported about her marijuana use and purchases. (Item 5.) \n \nOn June 20, 2018, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of her \nmarijuana use and purchases, including after she had been granted an interim Secret \nclearance in October 2016. In response to the SOR, Applicant indicated on July 6, 2018, \nthat she had purchased and used marijuana, but only during two discrete periods, those \nbeing during the month of January 2014 when she experimented with the drug \noccasionally, and then in May 2017 after she had been granted an interim clearance. \nAbout her more recent involvement, she stated in part: \n \nThere were a number of life events leading up to May 2017 including the loss \nof my fianc\u00e9, an apartment flood that ruined the majority of my belongings, \nand an impending layoff at my job due to an acquisition.4 My mental health \n                                                 \n3 After discussing the reason for Applicant\u2019s use in 2017, the OPM investigator reported, \u201cSubject started using \nmarijuana in this case from 01/2017 to 04/2017.\u201d Applicant was given an opportunity to review the summary of \nher interview, and she did not address that statement. (Item 5.)  \n \n4 Regarding any acquisition, it is noted that Applicant submitted a handwritten response on stationery of a \nsecurity company other than that named on her SF 86, although DOHA sent the SOR to her through the \ncompany named on her SF 86. \n\n5 \n \ntook a hit during this time and I became very depressed. I was having trouble \nfunctioning during the day and was unable to sleep at night. I purchased and \nused marijuana at this time (approximately 10 times). \n \n \nShe attributed her 2017 use of marijuana to \u201can unfortunate lapse in judgment and \nan attempt to sleep after having not properly done so for some time. She asked that her full \ndisclosure of her marijuana use on her SF 86 and during her OPM interview be considered \nas evidence of her good character. She also added that she also self-reported that the \nOPM investigator has used the information from her SF 86 to contact her and ask her out, \nand she complied with all inquiries in that regard. (Answer.) \n \nThe guidance provided by various U.S. government entities makes it clear that no \nstate can authorize violations of federal law, existing suitability criteria, or Executive Branch \npolicies. Federal agencies are prohibited from granting or renewing a security clearance to \nan unlawful user of a controlled substance or an addict. Executive Order 12564 mandates \na drug-free federal workplace. An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to \nmarijuana remains relevant to the suitability determination. From a prosecutorial standpoint \npriorities of the Department of Justice are to prevent the following: distribution of marijuana \nto minors; revenue from marijuana sales from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and \ncartels; diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law to other states; \nuse of state-authorized marijuana as a cover for trafficking of other illegal drugs; use of \nfirearms and other violence in cultivation and distribution of marijuana; drugged-driving \nassociated with marijuana use; growth of marijuana on public lands; and possession or use \nof marijuana on federal property. Jurisdictions that had implemented regulations for \nmarijuana activity are expected to provide the resources and demonstrate the willingness \nto enforce their laws and regulations in a manner that does not undermine federal \nenforcement priorities. (Items 6-11.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \n  \nApplicant took the occasion of her state\u2019s legalization of recreational use of minor \namounts of marijuana to use marijuana for about a month from January 2014 to February \n2014. Despite reportedly no use or purchase of marijuana for the next few years, she \nturned to marijuana to cope with anxiety and depression after she broke up with her then \nfianc\u00e9 in 2017. She admits that she purchased marijuana and that she used marijuana \nabout ten times in the privacy of her own home between April 2017 and May 2017, after \n\n7 \n \nshe had been granted an interim Secret clearance. The OPM investigator reported that she \n\u201cstarted using marijuana in this case from 01/2017 to 04/2017.\u201d She may have used \nmarijuana in 2017 before April of that year, but even if not, the evidence establishes \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition),\u201d AG \u00b6 \n25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position.\u201d \n \nThe Government\u2019s case for AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cexpressed intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to \ndiscontinue such use,\u201d is also established because Applicant used marijuana after she had \nindicated on her August 2016 SF 86 that she had no intention to use marijuana in the \nfuture. Her resumption of marijuana use in 2017 is concrete action that belies a clear and \nconvincing commitment to discontinue drug use. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) provides for mitigation when the drug involvement and substance misuse \n\u201chappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Although Applicant\u2019s use and purchases of marijuana \ncan reasonably be characterized as infrequent, her involvement after she completed her \nSF 86 and was granted an interim Secret clearance casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment with respect to whether she can be counted on to \nabide by federal laws and security requirements. AG \u00b6 26(a) has only minimal applicability. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) has some applicability because she acknowledges her drug involvement, \nand there is no evidence that she associates with drug-using associates and contacts. AG \n\u00b6 26(b) provides: \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s self-reporting of her marijuana involvement is some evidence of good \ncharacter.  Even so, it does not entitle her to a favorable security determination or negate \nthe security significance raised by her use of marijuana, especially while she was in a \nsensitive position. She claimed on her SF 86 that she had no intention to use marijuana in \nthe future because her decision to use and purchase the drug in 2014 was solely related to \n\n8 \n \nthe state\u2019s legalization. Her August 2016 SF 86 denial of any future intention to use \nmarijuana was under the advisement of Title 18, Section 1001, of the United States Code, \nwhich makes punishable as a felony offense any false statement. Assuming she did not \nthen intend any future marijuana use, she was on notice that future marijuana use was \nincompatible with a security clearance. She attributes her marijuana purchase and use in \n2017 to stressful life circumstances, none of which justifies her conduct in violation of \nfederal law and the trust imposed in her by the Government when it granted her an interim \nSecret clearance. She has apparently found healthier ways to address her depression and \nanxiety through yoga and anti-depressant medication, but it is troubling that she turned to \nmarijuana first. Before each of the 10 times or so that she used marijuana, she had an \nopportunity to consider whether her conduct was a problem for her security clearance \neligibility. Her present abstinence of less than two years is not sufficient to guarantee \nagainst recurrence, given she used marijuana in 2017 after three years of no illegal drug \ninvolvement. The information of record is insufficient to overcome the drug involvement \nand substance misuse security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).5 In making the overall commonsense determination required under AG \u00b6 2(c), I have \nonly the FORM, which shows Applicant cooperated with the investigation and adjudication \nprocess. While this is an important consideration, it is well settled that once a concern \narises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). The Government must be able to rely on those persons granted \nsecurity clearance eligibility to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, \nand policies, and without regard to their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, \nApplicant has raised enough doubt in that regard to where I am unable to conclude that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her eligibility for a security \nclearance. \n                                                 \n5 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows:  \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n\n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Edmunds, Esquire \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \ntrustworthiness \nconcerns \nregarding \nfinancial \nconsiderations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 20, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On March 12, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n01/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 19, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated April \n4, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On June 20, 2018, after retaining an \nattorney, Applicant changed his mind and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on June \n28, 2018. The case was assigned to me on July 12, 2018. A Notice of Hearing was issued \non July 12, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July 23, 2018. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5 and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE O were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 1, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE P through AE CC, \nwithout objection. The record closed on August 27, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR,1 Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through \n1.h., and 1.j.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a network analyst with his current employer since May 2017. He completed his high \nschool education through the General Educational Development (GED) Program in 1978, \nand he graduated from high school in 1983. At the time of the hearing, he was three \ncredits shy of completing the requirements for an Associate\u2019s degree. He has never \nserved in the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance, but has been \noccupying a position of public trust since 2017. Applicant was married in 2009. He has \nfour children, born in 1981, 1984, 1987, and 1989, as well as two stepchildren, born in \n1994, and 1995. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Although Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was submitted on April 4, 2018, the DOD CAF noted \nthat he had failed to respond to SOR \u00b6 1.j. After being reminded by the DOD CAF that he had initially failed \nto address the allegation, on April 11, 2018, Applicant admitted the allegation by e-mail. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations2 \n  \nWith the exception of one reported delinquent account from 2011, there apparently \nwas nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until 2016 when a series of factors started \ntaking their cumulative toll on his ability to remain current on his various accounts. He had \nbeen unemployed or underemployed on several occasions before 2016: from May 2009 \nuntil September 2009; from December 2013 until February 2014; and from April 2015 \nuntil November 2015. It was Applicant\u2019s initial intention to earn an Associate\u2019s degree, \nand to do so, he accepted low paying and less demanding positions to increase his skills \nthrough on-the-job training. However, in April 2016, Applicant was terminated from his \nposition because of unhappiness over his performance progression. He remained \nunemployed or underemployed until May 2017. During that most recent period, \nApplicant\u2019s savings were depleted, and accounts became delinquent. His residence went \ninto a foreclosure status, a tax lien was filed, and various accounts were placed for \ncollection. Some accounts were charged off. Another factor exacerbating Applicant\u2019s \nfinances were his repeated relocations from state to state, either to follow his wife and \nher employment activities, or to accept temporary employment opportunities.3 \nApplicant sought guidance from several credit counselors;4 completed a credit \ncounseling course;5 contacted various creditors in an effort to settle accounts or enter into \nreasonable repayment plans; engaged the professional services of both a credit \nconsolidation company and a debt resolution company;6 and, starting in July 2017 \u2013 eight \nmonths before the SOR was issued \u2013 he started setting aside $756 per month intended \nfor repayments to creditors.7 In April 2018, he was scheduled to commence a financial \ncounseling course with a nationally renowned financial expert.8  \nThe SOR identified 12 purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for \ncollection or charged off, including one tax lien and one house in a foreclosure status, as \ngenerally reflected by Applicant\u2019s August 2017 or January 2018 credit reports. Those \ndebts total approximately $71,303. The current status of those accounts is as follows: \n                                                          \n2 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated July 20, 2017); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated November \n28, 2017); GE 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated August 12, 2017); GE \n5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated January 26, 2018); AE B (Extracts of Experian Credit Report, dated July 7, \n2018); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated April 4, 2018.   \n  \n3 AE F (Statement, undated). \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n5 AE A (Certificate of Counseling, dated July 8, 2018). \n \n6 GE 3 (Debt Resolution Agreement, dated July 10, 2017). \n \n7 GE 3, supra note 6, at 7. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a conventional home mortgage with a high credit of $100,000 \nand an unpaid balance of $68,868, of which $18,534 was past-due, which was placed for \ncollection and entered into a foreclosure status.9 Because of a new job, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation had to be recertified, but the process took more time than anticipated, \nand new loan modification documents had to be prepared. Applicant continued making \nmonthly payments of $428.86 for five months. The foreclosure action was terminated in \nMay 2018, and as of June 1, 2018, the modified mortgage was established in the amount \nof $67,375.85, with monthly payments of $313.81, plus escrow, totaling $537.90.10 The \npast-due amount has been added into the amount of the mortgage, and the mortgage is \ncurrent. The account has been resolved. \n (SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is a credit-card account with an unpaid balance of $24,275, \nand a past-due balance of $8,606, that was placed for collection and charged off.11 \nThrough his debt resolution company, Applicant reached out to the creditor and after \napproximately one year, negotiations went nowhere. In his e-QIP, he stated that the \ncreditor had agreed to a settlement of $12,678, and unspecified monthly payments would \nbe made through his debt resolution company.12 That assertion was not accurate, for the \ncreditor refused to accept any reduced payments. In June 2018, working with another \ncredit counseling organization, Applicant was referred to another lender, with whom the \ncreditor frequently worked, and he was approved for a $24,275 loan, to be repaid under \na repayment plan under which he would make previously authorized $566 monthly \npayments for 35 months, starting in August 2018.13 At some point by the end of 2018, it \nwas anticipated that the original creditor would be paid in full by the new loan, and \nApplicant would merely be responsible for the continuing reduced monthly payments to \nthe new lender.14 The account has been resolved. \n (SOR \u00b6 1.c.): This is a bank-issued credit-card account with an unpaid and past-\ndue balance of $10,091 that was placed for collection and charged off.15 Applicant \nreached out to the collection agent in June 2017 \u2013 nine months before the SOR was \nissued \u2013 and agreed to a repayment plan under which he agreed to make preauthorized \nbi-monthly $64 payments, starting in June 2017. He made those payments, totaling \n$1,088, until the account was transferred to a new collection agent in early 2018.16 A \nrevised repayment plan was accepted by the new collection agent in mid-2018, under \n                                                          \n9 GE 4, supra note 2, at 7; GE 5, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n10 AE G (Loan Modification Documents, various dates). \n \n11 GE 4, supra note 2, at 8; GE 5, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n12 GE 1, supra note 2, at 43-44. \n \n13 AE H (Loan Documents, dated July 20, 2018); AE H (Statement, undated); AE P (Debt Payment \nPlan, undated).  \n \n14 AE Q, supra note 13; AE Q (Account Activity Statement, dated August 21, 2018). \n \n15 GE 4, supra note 2, at 8; GE 5, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n16 AE I (Statement, undated); AE I (Payment History, undated). \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nwhich Applicant agreed to preauthorized automatic $110 monthly payments until \nDecember 2018. At that point, the collection agent was anticipated to offer a discount of \n30 percent for a 15-month payoff plan.17 The account is in the process of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.e.): These are two bank-issued credit-card accounts with \nunpaid balances of $5,948 and $3,997 that were placed for collection and charged off.18 \nApplicant\u2019s debt resolution company and the collection agent agreed to repayment plans \nfor both accounts, and commencing in April 2018, monthly payments have been made to \nthe larger of the two accounts: $162 for the first month, and $146 each successive month; \nand to the smaller account: $100 each month.19 Both accounts are in the process of being \nresolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): This is a bank-issued charge account with an unpaid balance of \n$3,230 that was placed for collection.20 Applicant reached out to the collection agent in \nJuly 2018, a repayment plan was proposed under which he agreed to make monthly $44 \npayments. While there is a schedule of future payments, Applicant only furnished \ndocumentation to confirm that the initial payment had been made.21 Applicant stated that \nit is his intention to continue making the monthly payments, and after other debts are paid \noff, he would increase these monthly payments.22 Nevertheless, the account is in the \nprocess of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): This is an unspecified type of account with an unpaid and past-due \nbalance of $1,615 that was placed for collection and charged off.23 Applicant reached out \nto the debt purchaser and agreed to a repayment plan under which he authorized \nautomatic monthly withdrawals from his account in the amount of $50. He submitted \ndocumentation of several routine past monthly payments.24 Applicant also contended that \nthe collection agent had agreed to settle the account for $795, he failed to submit any \n                                                          \n17 AE I (Repayment Plan Documents, various dates); AE R (Repayment Plan Documents, various \ndates); Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2, at 2; AE P, supra note 13. \n \n18 GE 4, supra note 2, at 8; GE 5, supra note 2, at 2; Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 2. \n \n19 AE J (Repayment Plan Documents, various dates); AE T (Letter, dated August 16, 2018); AE S \n(Account Activity Statements, various dates); AE P, supra note 13. \n \n20 GE 5, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n21 AE K (Letter, undated); AE V (Repayment Plan Documents, various dates); Answer to the SOR, \nsupra note 3, at 2.  \n22 AE K, supra note 21, at 1.

He expects the account to be paid in full by \nJanuary 2019.25 The account is in the process of being resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h.): This is an unspecified type of bank account with an unpaid balance \nof $1,066 that was placed for collection.26 Applicant and the collection agent agreed to a \nrepayment plan under which, commencing in July 2018, monthly $45 payments would be \nmade. He submitted documentation reflecting only one such payment.27 On August 16, \n2018, the collection agent offered to settle the account for one lump-sum payment of $465 \nto be made by August 28, 2018, but Applicant was apparently unable to make such a \npayment. Nevertheless, the account is in the process of being resolved.28 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i.): This is a bank-issued charge account with an unpaid balance of \n$1,015 that was placed for collection and sold to a debt purchaser.29 Applicant\u2019s debt \nresolution company and the debt purchaser agreed to a $601 settlement, followed by a \nrepayment plan in September 2017 \u2013 six months before the SOR was issued \u2013 and in \nMarch 2018, a final payment was made under that plan.

The unpaid tax \nof $137 was increased because of fees. After several unsuccessful efforts to set up a \nrepayment plan with the collection agent, an agreement was finally established in July \n2018, under which Applicant agreed to make monthly $100 payments.32 Applicant \nfurnished documentation to confirm that a few payments had been made.33 Because \nthere was an issue regarding the accuracy of the amount owed the state because of a \ntax-preparer error, the state is reviewing the issue.34 Nevertheless, the lien is in the \nprocess of being resolved. \n                                                          \n25 Answer to the SOR, supra note 3, at 2. \n \n26 GE 5, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n27 AE X (Repayment Plan Documents, various dates); AW J, supra note 19; AE P, supra note 13. \n \n28 AE X (Letter, dated August 16, 2018). \n \n29 GE 4, supra note 2, at 16; GE 5, supra note 2, at 2. \n \n30 AE J (Payment Transactions, undated); AE Y (Repayment Plan Documents, various dates); AE \nT, supra note 19); AE P, supra note 13; AE B (Account Details, undated). \n \n31 GE 4, supra note 2, at 6; GE 5, supra note 2, at 5. \n \n32 AE M (Repayment Plan Documents, undated); AE Z (Repayment Plan Documents, various \ndates); AE W (Certified Mail Receipt, dated July 25, 2018).  \n \n33 AE Z, supra note 32. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k.): This is a cellular telephone account with an unpaid balance of $175 \nthat was placed for collection.35 Applicant contends that the original balance was $120, \nand that he had been making unspecified payments for an unspecified period. He also \nclaimed that the collection agent offered to settle the account for $80 in two separate $40 \npayments. Those payments were made on April 20, 2018 and May 18, 2018.36 However, \nit appears that the collection agent representative was not legitimate, and a fraud \ninvestigation was opened.

The creditor \nconfirmed the error.39 The account has been resolved. \nOther than the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant is not aware of any other \ndelinquent accounts.

DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained \nin the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.44  \n \nPositions formerly designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as noncritical-\nsensitive positions and include those personnel \u201c[w]ith access to automated systems that \ncontain military active duty, guard, or reservists\u2019 personally identifiable information or \ninformation pertaining to Service members that is otherwise protected from disclosure by \n[the DOD Privacy Program] where such access has the potential to cause serious \ndamage to the national security.\u201d45 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n \n42 AE F (Character Reference, undated). \n \n43 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n44 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n45 DOD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DOD Personnel Security Program (PSP) (April 3, \n2017) (Manual), \u00b6 4.1.a. (3)(c). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d46 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.47  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.48 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n                                                          \n46 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n47 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n48 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to maintain several accounts in a current status and a number of \nthem became delinquent. Accounts were placed for collection or charged off, a house \nwent into a foreclosure status, and a state tax lien was filed. Those debts total \napproximately $71,303. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. AG \u00b6 19(b) \nhas not been established because there is no evidence that Applicant had the ability to \npay his debts but was unwilling to do so.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;49 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n                                                          \n49 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;50  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all fully or partially apply. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties periodically arose because he was generally unemployed or \nunderemployed from May 2009 until May 2017 \u2013 situations that were largely beyond his \ncontrol. Applicant\u2019s savings were eventually depleted, and accounts became delinquent. \nAnother factor exacerbating Applicant\u2019s finances were his repeated relocations from state \nto state, either to follow his wife and her employment activities, or to accept temporary \nemployment opportunities. Applicant acted responsibly by seeking information from his \ncreditors or collection agents,51 and by obtaining financial counseling and credit resolution \nguidance and assistance. Either he or his credit resolution company reached out to the \nvarious creditors, collection attorneys, and collection agents, and discussed settlement \npossibilities and repayment arrangements. Applicant entered into repayment \n                                                          \n50 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n51 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \narrangements with some creditors, agreed to settlements with some creditors, and paid \noff or otherwise resolved some SOR debts. He made arrangements with the state tax \nauthority, and he is in compliance with those arrangements. As his debts were reduced, \nApplicant continued making his monthly payments with the intention of increasing those \npayments as the opportunity to do so presented itself. Applicant offered substantial \nevidence to indicate that his financial situation is now under better control. Applicant\u2019s \nactions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.52 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, however, \nApplicant\u2019s promises transitioned into positive action, and he now has a history of fulfilling \nhis promises. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.53 \n                                                          \n52 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n53 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant failed to \nmaintain several accounts in a current status and a number of them became delinquent. \nAccounts totaling approximately $71,303 were placed for collection or charged off, a \nhouse went into a foreclosure status, and a state tax lien was filed. While Applicant \nobtained financial guidance and addressed some debts before the SOR was issued, it \nappears that a significant portion of his actions in actually paying his debts did not \ncommence until after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nnetwork analyst processer \u2013 a position of public trust \u2013 with his current employer since \nMay 2017. He has been described as a hard-working, well-respected mentor, and a \nperson of integrity who is very intelligent, professional, and pivotal in building trust \nrelationships. Rather than simply ignoring his creditors, Applicant reached out to them, \neither directly or through his credit resolution company, and discussed settlement or \nrepayment possibilities. He entered into repayment agreements with some creditors; paid \noff, or otherwise resolved, other accounts; or is in the process of resolving all of his \nremaining debts. His house is no longer in a foreclosure status. With $5,266 in monthly \nnet income, not including any income by his wife; $4,681 in monthly expenses, including \nthose made to his debt resolution company, and other payments made directly to his \ncreditors; and $585 as a monthly remainder available for discretionary saving or \nspending, Applicant\u2019s finances appear to be good, and it is anticipated that they will \nimprove once his repayment plans are successfully completed and more debts are paid. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:54 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \n                                                          \n \n54 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a good track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, resolving, or in the process of resolving, all of his debts. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nposition of public trust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has successfully \nmitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.l.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of public \ntrust to support a contract with the DOD.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d in part and denied them in part.3 His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and F-16 pilot who is employed by a defense contractor. He and his wife have been married since 1995. They have three children, ages 22, 21, and 10. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1993 and a master\u2019s degree in 2005. He served in the Air Force from 1993 to 2016, retiring as a lieutenant colonel. Rated as a \u201ccommand pilot,\u201d he had over 2,500 flying hours and more than 300 hours flying over combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has worked for his employer in the defense industry since May 2016, as the deputy director of one of the company\u2019s divisions.

Jewell, Esq.  \n \n \n05/03/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol involvement includes a June 2015 DUI with a high \nblood-alcohol content, a 2015 diagnosis of a severe alcohol use disorder, and evidence \nof continued alcohol consumption. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns established by his actions and his serious alcohol use disorder. He has \nresumed drinking, despite his diagnosis. He has indicated an intent to resume \ncounseling, as recommended to avoid relapse or alcohol abuse, but has not yet done \nso. Applicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate Guideline G security \nconcerns. Eligibility for continued access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 8, 2017. On \nJune 7, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline G, alcohol consumption. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992, as amended), and the Security \n\n \n2 \n \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 14, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).1 \nHis Answer included 11 enclosures (Ans. Encl. 1-11), included in the record without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on November 13, 2018. On November 21, \n2018, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for December 12, 2018.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through GE 8, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through G were also admitted without objection. Applicant and five \nwitnesses testified. I left the record open after the hearing to provide Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional evidence. He timely submitted five additional exhibits, \nwhich were marked and admitted without objection as AE H through L. The record \nclosed on January 10, 2019.2 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 2, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d in \npart and denied them in part.3 His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He is a retired U.S. Air Force officer and F-16 pilot who \nis employed by a defense contractor. He and his wife have been married since 1995. \nThey have three children, ages 22, 21, and 10. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1993 and a master\u2019s degree in 2005. He served in the Air Force from 1993 to 2016, \nretiring as a lieutenant colonel. Rated as a \u201ccommand pilot,\u201d he had over 2,500 flying \nhours and more than 300 hours flying over combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. He \nhas worked for his employer in the defense industry since May 2016, as the deputy \ndirector of one of the company\u2019s divisions. He has held a security clearance for 26 years \n                                                          \n1 When he answered the SOR, Applicant did not formally \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d the allegations. I noted this in \nan e-mail to counsel before the hearing, and Applicant addressed each allegation during hearing \npreliminaries. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I; Tr. 10-14)  \n \n2 Post-Hearing e-mail correspondence between myself and the parties is marked as HE IV. On December \n21, 2019, when he provided Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions, counsel requested \u201can indefinite delay \nin your ruling in order to provide ongoing updates\u201d from Applicant\u2019s counselor. I declined to hold the \nrecord open indefinitely for submission of evidence on an ongoing basis. DOD Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E.3.1.10 \nstates that \u201c[t]he Administrative Judge . . . shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly \nmanner.\u201d (Emphasis added) Additionally, \u00b6 E3.1.25 states that \u201cThe Administrative Judge shall make a \nwritten clearance decision in a timely manner . . .\u201d An applicant is not entitled to a delayed or deferred \nadjudication of his or her security eligibility. ISCR Case No. 10-07892 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 7, 2011); ISCR \nCase No. 09-02926 at 2 (App. Bd. May 11, 2010). \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s partial denials as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d largely concerned the fact that the allegations \nmisidentified the facility where he was treated and diagnosed. He otherwise admitted the substance of the \nallegations. (Tr. 12-13, 28-29) \n\n \n3 \n \nsince he was commissioned as an Air Force officer. (Tr. 16, 53, 122-123, 159-162; Ans. \nEncl. 11; SCA; AE G) \n \n \nApplicant discussed his historical drinking pattern in his background interview. He \nwas a social and weekend drinker in college. He drank alcohol sporadically in the Air \nForce until about 2012, when his drinking increased significantly after his wife became \nseriously ill. Applicant dealt with the resulting stress by drinking frequently as a coping \nmechanism. He said in his background interview that during this period, he consumed \nfour to six glasses of beer or wine on a daily basis. (Tr. 165; GE 2 at 12) At hearing, \nApplicant testified that his drinking became \u201cunhealthy\u201d sometime in early 2015, and \nthat he was drinking habitually, four or five times a week at the time. (Tr. 145-147) He \nsaid no one came to him at the time and said he was drinking too much, nor did he \nrealize that himself. (Tr. 190-191) \n \n \n \nIn June 2015, Applicant was stationed at a military base near where he now \nlives, in State 1. He went to another state, State 2, to attend a conference. The night \nbefore he was to return, he consumed eight to ten alcoholic drinks over a five-hour \nperiod, alone in his hotel room. He had been working out beforehand, and had nothing \nelse to eat or drink. (Tr. 162-164; GE 2 at 11) \n \n \n \nApplicant went to sleep after midnight. He woke at about 3:30 am and drove to \nthe airport for his return flight. While en route, he became disoriented and entered an \ninterstate highway by driving the wrong way down the exit ramp. He was stopped by \npolice after he was seen driving eastbound in a westbound lane. (Tr. 123-125, 163-164; \nGE 2 at 11; GE 7 at 1) \n \n \n \nApplicant was administered a breathalyzer test at the scene and registered a \nblood alcohol content (BAC) of .225. Results of a blood test later showed a BAC of .28. \nHe was arrested and initially charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and \nreckless driving under State 2 law. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 125; GE 7 at 1; GE 2 at 7, 11)  \n \n \nApplicant immediately disclosed his arrest to his command. Upon returning, he \nwas referred to the Air Force Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention Treatment (ADAPT) \nprogram and diagnosed in early July 2015 with a severe alcohol use disorder after \nmeeting 8 of the 11 criteria for alcohol use disorder under the Diagnostic and Statistical \nManual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). (Tr. 126, 131, 144, GE 4 at 1)  \n \n \nApplicant then entered recommended inpatient treatment at the Substance \nAbuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP) at a local Navy hospital. (SOR \u00b6 1.b)4 While his \nattendance was voluntary, he was also told that if he chose not to enter inpatient alcohol \ntreatment, the Air Force would begin administrative separation proceedings. While he \n                                                          \n4 SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe, while in inpatient \ntreatment at the Navy\u2019s SARP program, when in fact, the initial diagnosis was made during his initial \nalcohol evaluation by Air Force ADAPT providers. (Tr. 131; GE 4 at 2). While there is no documentation of \nSARP\u2019s diagnosis, Applicant testified that SARP accepted the diagnosis he received from the Air Force, \n\u201cand just put me into treatment.\u201d (Tr. 150) \n \n\n \n4 \n \ninitially preferred outpatient treatment, he also recognized that he had a problem with \nalcohol, so he was \u201ceasily convinced and ready to get help.\u201d (Tr. 126-127, 130, 135, \n149-150, 166; GE 1 at 38, 46).  \n \n \nApplicant was in inpatient treatment at SARP for 30 days in July and August \n2015. He was considered \u201can active and motivated member of treatment groups,\u201d and \nhe successfully completed inpatient treatment in August 2015. (Tr. 131, 151, GE 4 at 2; \nGE 5; Ans. Encl. 3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s continuing care and aftercare plan developed by ADAPT in August \n2015, which he acknowledged by signature, detailed certain requirements over the next \n12 months. They included: 1) abstinence from alcohol; 2) participation in at least one to \nthree self-help group meetings per week (Alcoholics Anonymous, or \u201cAA\u201d); 3) weekly \nfollow-up counseling with his ADAPT counselor; and 4) participation in a formalized \ncontinuing care group on a weekly basis for the next 12 months. (Tr. 131-132, 151-153; \nGE 5 at 2-3) \n \n \nApplicant testified at hearing that his abstinence \u201cwas unrelated to the treatment\u201d \nhe received at SARP, but was instead \u201crelated to me wanting to fly again.\u201d (Tr. 151; \nAns. Enc. 3) The documentary record says otherwise, however, as abstinence from \nalcohol is the first requirement listed in the ADAPT program. (GE 5 at 2) \n \n \nAfter inpatient treatment, Applicant transitioned to the ADAPT continuing-care \nabstinence group, where he continued treatment on a bi-monthly basis. He met with a \ncounselor to discuss treatment goals (maintaining abstinence from alcohol, improving \nstress management skills and improving his marriage). He attended meetings with a \nlocal alcohol-abstinence support group, what he called \u201cAA for aviators,\u201d became more \nengaged at church, and began marital counseling. (Tr. 131-133, 167-169; GE 4 at 2; \nAns. Encl. 3) \n \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant received a letter of reprimand from his \ncommanding officer as a result of his arrest. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) The letter noted that, in \naddition to the civilian charges of DUI and reckless driving, he was also in violation of \nArticle 111 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for drunken operation of a \nvehicle. (GE 7 at 1) A determination was made to adjudicate Applicant\u2019s DUI in State 2 \ncriminal court, so Applicant was not formally charged by military authorities. (Tr. 126-\n128; GE 2 at 7)  \n \n \nIn October 2015, after two months in continuing care, Applicant transitioned to \nthe aftercare phase of the ADAPT program. (SOR \u00b6 1.d)5 During this phase, he met \nmonthly with his ADAPT program manager, an Air Force captain in the Biomedical \nService Corps (BSC). He also continued attending other support groups, including the \n                                                          \n5 SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant received aftercare treatment with ADAPT at the Navy hospital from \nAugust to October 2015, and was again diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. In fact, Applicant \nbegan the Aftercare program in October 2015, after two months in the \u201ccontinuing care abstinence \ngroup,\u201d and the program was run by the Air Force, not the Navy. Applicant said he did not recall a \u201cnew \ndiagnosis\u201d at that stage. (Tr. 152)  \n\n \n5 \n \n\u201cAA for aviators\u201d program. He abstained from alcohol throughout the program, verified \nby lab tests. (Tr. 131-133, 154, 167-169; GE 4 at 2; GE 6; GE 7 at 3-6; Ans. Encl. 3)  \n \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant requested an updated alcohol evaluation from \nADAPT in order to maintain his flight status. His DSM-V diagnosis at that time was \nalcohol use disorder, severe, in early remission, because he had no demonstrated \nsymptoms for \u201clonger than three months but less than one year.\u201d (GE 4 at 3-4)  \n \n \nThe ADAPT providers noted that, given the \u201cbeneficial and socially supportive \nnature\u201d of Applicant\u2019s participation in marital therapy and the \u201cAA for aviators\u201d group,  \n \n \nit is recommended that he continue to engage in these therapeutic outlets \nin the future (i.e., post-ADAPT treatment), in order to continue his upward \nprognostic trajectory and best assist him in the maintenance of his \nabstinence as well as the continued remission of his condition.6  \n \n \nGiven this evidence, and given Applicant\u2019s stated desire to maintain a sober \nlifestyle and to continue progressing towards recovery, his prognosis was regarded as \nexcellent. It was estimated that in the absence of relapse, his condition would eventually \nmeet the criteria for alcohol use disorder, severe, in sustained remission if he \ndemonstrated no symptoms for over a year. (GE 4 at 4)  \n \n \nApplicant was allowed to maintain his flight status. (Tr. 132-133, 161, 170) He \nwas subject to a retirement grade determination but was allowed to retire from the Air \nForce as a lieutenant colonel in early May 2016.7 (GE 2 at 7; Ans. Encl. 5; AE A \u2013 AE C)  \n \n \nApplicant did not complete the Air Force\u2019s ADAPT aftercare program because he \nretired from the Air Force. (Tr. 137, 181) The record does not indicate that Applicant \npursued a civilian alternative to the ADAPT program once he retired.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DUI case in State 2 remained pending until February 2017, when he \npleaded guilty to one count of DUI, extreme BAC, .15 \u2013 .19. The remaining charges, a) \nDUI; b) DUI \u2013 liquor BAC .08 or more; c) DUI extreme BAC .20 or more; and d) reckless \ndriving) were dismissed. (GE 3; GE 1 at 40-41) Applicant was sentenced to 12 months \nof unsupervised probation, which he completed. He was ordered to pay about $3,000 in \nfines, fees, and costs, which he did in October 2017. He had an ignition interlock device \ninstalled on his car from May 2017 to May 2018, and had no violations. He attended a \nMothers Against Drunk Driving panel. He was not under any pre-trial restrictions from \nState 2 authorities before he pleaded guilty, and was not required to abstain from \nalcohol while on probation. (Tr. 128-129, 155-158, 171-175; GE 1 at 41-42; GE 3; AE H)  \n                                                          \n6 GE 4 at 4 (emphasis added) \n \n7 In March 2016, DOD CAF issued Applicant a Memorandum of Intent (MOI) to revoke his security \nclearance, alleging security concerns due to the DUI arrest. As a result, his security clearance was \nsuspended. Applicant responded to the MOI on March 15, 2016. (GE 8) Because he retired from the Air \nForce soon thereafter, it does not appear that the March 2016 MOI was ever adjudicated. (Tr. 189-190) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant resumed drinking after leaving the Air Force. He said in his background \ninterview that he resumed drinking in June 2016 (about one year after the DUI). (GE 2 \nat 12) At hearing, he said he resumed drinking around his birthday, in September 2016 \n(about 15 months after the DUI). (Tr. 134-136, 158, 176-177) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his current pattern of consumption is to have two to three \ndrinks about two or three times a week. He described his pattern as social drinking with \nfamily and friends, such as on weekends watching football, and a drink on special \noccasions, such as birthdays or holidays. (Tr. 137-138, 177-178; GE 2 at 2, 12) He said \nwhen he is on business travel, he takes customers out and will \u201cprobably have a couple \nmore drinks than my average.\u201d (Tr. 138)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s renewed consumption of alcohol is alleged as a security concern, as \nit post-dates his treatment for alcohol use disorder. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) In an affidavit submitted \nwith his Answer to the SOR, he reported that:  \n \n[Applicant\u2019s mental health doctor during ADAPT treatment] knew I was \nabstaining from alcohol during treatment and that I was hitting or \nexceeding all of my progress goals. My doctors also knew I had not made \na decision as to whether I would abstain forever, and complete abstinence \nwas never a mandatory part of my long-term treatment plan. In fact, I \nrecall several treatment sessions where we discussed that living sober did \nnot necessarily mean living dry.8 \n \n \nApplicant also stated in his affidavit that he was required to abstain from alcohol \nonly as long as he was on flight orders, though this was \u201cnot an official part of my \ntreatment plan.\u201d (Ans. Enc. 3 at 2) He asserted in his affidavit that his resumed social \ndrinking has been safe and responsible, and without any adverse issues, either \npersonally or professionally. Applicant also attested that \u201cmy responsible consumption \nof alcohol is completely in line with my treatment plan, as explained to me by my \ndoctors when I completed treatment.\u201d (Ans. Encl. 3 at 2) He testified that he was never \ntold by his doctors that he could never drink alcohol again. (Tr. 133, 158, 171) Applicant \nwas not told by anyone else that he is drinking too much. (Tr. 191) These statements \nare unsupported by updated corroborating documentation. Applicant did not indicate \nthat he currently drinks to intoxication, and he reported no additional alcohol-related \noffenses or \u201cnegative incidents.\u201d (Tr. 138, 176; GE 2)  \n \n \nAfter retiring from the Air Force, Applicant continued marital counseling. He also \nsupported his wife as they sought medical care at various hospitals for her medical \nconditions, as they raised their three children. He began a busy travel schedule in his \ncurrent job. Applicant attended the \u201cAA for aviators\u201d support group for about a year and \nbenefitted from it, but stopped going in part because it was geographically difficult to get \nthere. (Tr. 182-183: GE 2 at 12) Applicant offered no evidence at hearing that he is \n                                                          \n8 Ans. Encl. 3; see also Tr. 133-134.  \n\n \n7 \n \ncurrently participating in AA or any similar counseling group, nor did he indicate \nsustained involvement with a formal support network to help him address his drinking. \n \n \nApplicant testified that after the DUI, he was prohibited from driving in the county \nin State 2 where the offense occurred. (Tr. 174) Shortly before his DOHA hearing, he \nwas on a business trip in another state, and was told that his driver\u2019s license was about \nto expire, which he had not noticed. Even though he had lived in State 1 for several \nyears, he still had a driver\u2019s license from State 3, where he had served in the Air Force \nfrom 2007 to 2010. (GE 1 at 17) When he sought to get a new license, he learned that \nhis State 3 driver\u2019s license had been suspended as a result of the DUI. Applicant \ntestified that he was unaware of this, and said that he did not drive until his license was \nrenewed. (Tr. 183-188) \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant presented documentation from State 3 of an alcohol \nassessment he underwent in November 2018 in order to have his driving privileges \nrenewed there (a prerequisite for getting a valid license in State 1). He testified that he \nwas issued a valid driver\u2019s license from State 1 a few days before his hearing. (Tr. 183-\n188) \n \n \nThe assessment is from a licensed professional counselor (LPC) in State 1. (AE \nJ; AE L) She met with Applicant for one hour, in November 2018. (AE I) The \nassessment summarizes the procedural history of the DUI case in State 2, Applicant\u2019s \ntreatment and counseling, retirement from the Air Force, and the requirements of his \nprobation. The assessment does not mention Applicant\u2019s June 2015 diagnosis of a \nsevere alcohol use disorder, or the February 2016 diagnosis that his disorder was in \nearly remission at that time. The documentation does not include an updated diagnosis \nof Applicant\u2019s alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \nWith respect to a prognosis, the assessor finds that Applicant \u201cdid not present as \na risk to himself or others regarding the use of alcohol.\u201d The LPC found that Applicant \ndemonstrated that \u201che is managing his stress level and appears to be functioning within \nnormal limits at this time.\u201d (AE J at 15/26) \n \n \nThe assessor noted, however, that a \u201cplan should be in place for [Applicant] to \nmanage his stress levels and not [succumb] to relapse or alcohol abuse.\u201d (AE J at \n13/26) Counseling was recommended to help him manage his stress and his wife\u2019s \nhealth issues. (AE J at 16/26) After the hearing, Applicant e-mailed the LPC and said he \nwanted to begin counseling with her. (AE K) There is no indication of additional \ncounseling with the LPC as of the date the record closed. \n \n \nIn his testimony, Applicant acknowledged his poor judgment the night of the DUI. \nHe referred to the event as \u201clife-changing.\u201d He intends to continue making \u201cgood \npersonal decisions\u201d and relying on his support network of family, friends and counselors \ngoing forward. He is also very patriotic, and understands the security significance of his \nactions. He accepted responsibility for his actions and was remorseful. (Tr. 123, 139-\n143)  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nTwo witnesses from Applicant\u2019s current employment testified. Witness 1 (W1) is \na senior lead engineer for Applicant\u2019s employer. Applicant is one of his supervisors, but \nthey work in separate geographic areas. Witness 2 (W2) is the facility security officer \n(FSO) for Applicant\u2019s employer and several of its subsidiaries. (AE D) He served in the \nAir Force for 30 years, retiring as a master sergeant. Both W1 and W2 have had \nclearances for many years. Applicant\u2019s work performance is \u201cbeyond reproach\u201d and \n\u201cstellar.\u201d Applicant has been upfront about the DUI, and uses it as a cautionary tale for \nothers. The incident had a \u201chuge impact on him.\u201d W1 and W2 are aware that Applicant \nabstained from alcohol for a year and has resumed drinking. As the FSO, W2 has had \ninteraction with others who have had alcohol issues. He noted no \u201ctelltale\u201d signs of \nalcohol issues with Applicant. He said it would be a security concern if Applicant had \nrepeated alcohol issues, but he had none, but for the DUI. Both W1 and W 2 rate \nApplicant a \u201c10\u201d (on a 1-10 scale) for national security trustworthiness and suitability. \n(Tr. 37-49; (Tr. 50-55; AE D) \n \n \nTwo other witnesses testified who had firsthand knowledge of the DUI and its \naftermath. Witness 3 (W3) and Witness 4 (W4) are both retired Air Force colonels. W3 \nwas the deputy division chief at the Air Force command where Applicant served at the \ntime of the DUI. W4 was Applicant\u2019s supervisor at the time, and he issued Applicant GE \n7, the letter of reprimand. Applicant\u2019s performance at the command was \u201coutstanding\u201d \nand \u201cexemplary.\u201d Both W3 and W4 recommended that Applicant retain his rank at \nretirement. (AE A; AE B) W3 testified that he has \u201cabsolute faith and trust\u201d in Applicant, \nand he provides a valuable service to the Air Force in his position. W3 regards Applicant \nas a \u201cfine gentleman.\u201d (Tr. 71-108) \n \n \nW4 is aware of Applicant\u2019s participation in alcohol treatment. W4 said that \nApplicant\u2019s professionalism \u201cnever wavered\u201d after the DUI. He said Applicant was \nforthcoming, admitted his mistakes, and wanted to move forward from them. W4 \nbelieves Applicant has learned \u201ca tremendously difficult lesson.\u201d Applicant\u2019s judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability are \u201cupstanding [and] of the highest order\u201d and he \nbelieves Applicant should have a clearance. (Tr. 89-108; AE B; AE E) \n \n \n \nWitness 5 (W5) is Applicant\u2019s brother. He testified by phone. He is a police \nsergeant in a large U.S. city. He is professionally experienced with the importance of \nconfidentiality, privacy, and the protection of sensitive information. W5 testified that \nApplicant is a loving father and family man with excellent character. (Tr. 111-113) W5 is \naware of the DUI, but has never known Applicant to otherwise behave irresponsibly with \nalcohol. W5 is aware of Applicant\u2019s alcohol treatment, his one year of abstinence, and \nthe fact that he has resumed drinking. It does not cause W5 concern with respect to \nApplicant\u2019s ability to safeguard secrets. W5 considers his brother a role model and \n\u201cmoral compass.\u201d He has always admired Applicant\u2019s patriotism, dedication, and \ncommitment to his family. (Tr. 111-119)  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.9 As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d10 \n \n \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21:   \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n                                                          \n9 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)  \n \n10 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n10 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence . . . or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency \nof the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) or alcohol use disorder;  \n \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n \n(f) alcohol consumption which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder.  \n \n \n \nApplicant was a social and weekend drinker until about 2012, when his drinking \nincreased significantly after his wife\u2019s chronic medical condition began to cause stress \nand strain on both Applicant and his wife, and he turned to alcohol as a coping \nmechanism. By 2015, he was having several drinks, several days a week, and reached \nwhat he acknowledged was an unhealthy level of drinking. His June 2015 arrest for DUI \noccurred after a night of binge drinking. He was arrested and charged with multiple DUI \noffenses, and pleaded guilty to one count of DUI, extreme BAC, .15 \u2013 .19. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) \nand 22(c) apply. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d concern Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of a severe alcohol use \ndisorder, severe, and his related inpatient treatment and participation in aftercare. \nApplicant admits that he was initially diagnosed by Air Force ADAPT providers during \nhis initial assessment after the DUI, and that the diagnosis was accepted by the Navy \nSARP personnel. Applicant\u2019s inpatient treatment and aftercare do not constitute \ndisqualifying conduct, and no AGs apply. The diagnosis itself, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nis established, and it satisfies AG \u00b6 22(d). \n  \n \nApplicant testified that he did not receive a \u201cnew diagnosis\u201d from ADAPT \nproviders, either during continuing care or aftercare, after he left inpatient treatment in \nAugust 2015. Nor does the record contain any such documentation, either from the \nNavy (as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d) or from Air Force ADAPT providers. Even if it were \nestablished, such a diagnosis would largely have confirmed the initial diagnosis in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b, made only a few weeks or months earlier. As such, it would be essentially \nduplicative. Regardless, SOR \u00b6 1.d is resolved for Applicant.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s letter of reprimand, while a direct and negative consequence of his \nDUI, also does not constitute disqualifying conduct under Guideline G. SOR \u00b6 1.c is \ntherefore found for Applicant.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a security concern because Applicant \u201ccontinue[s] to consume \nalcohol, notwithstanding [his] treatment for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use \nDisorder.\u201d Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.e. SOR \u00b6 1.e does not allege that Applicant\u2019s \nresumed consumption of alcohol was contrary to treatment recommendations; indeed, \nhe asserted that he was only required to abstain from alcohol only in order to maintain \nhis flying status. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s ADAPT providers recommended in February \n2016 that he continue with therapy and the \u201cAA for aviators\u201d program, including after \nADAPT, \u201cin order to continue his upward prognostic trajectory and best assist him in the \nmaintenance of his abstinence as well as the continued remission of his condition.\u201d (GE \n4 at 4). Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he followed these \nrecommendations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and 22(f) therefore apply to SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations.  \n \n \nThe most recent diagnosis in the record is from February 2016, when ADAPT \nproviders concluded that Applicant\u2019s severe alcohol use disorder was in early remission. \nThis was based on his ongoing abstinence, participation in counseling, as well as a \nstated desire to maintain a sober lifestyle and to continue progressing towards recovery. \nHe had an excellent prognosis for continued progress, and he would eventually be \u201cin \nsustained remission\u201d if he continued to demonstrate no symptoms for over a year.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nApplicant did not complete the Air Force\u2019s ADAPT program and did not find a \ncivilian alternative. He was in the \u201cAA for aviators\u201d program for a time but is not \nparticipating currently. He therefore did not follow the therapeutic recommendations of \nhis ADAPT providers after leaving the program. He also resumed drinking, thereby \nstopping the \u201cupward prognostic trajectory\u201d towards sustained remission of his \ncondition. AG \u00b6 23(d) does not apply.  \n \n \nAfter the hearing, Applicant contacted the LPC who did the assessment he \nneeded to renew his driver\u2019s license, and indicated an interest in pursuing counseling \nwith her. But that counseling had not begun when the record closed, so AG \u00b6 23(c) \ndoes not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant resumed drinking alcohol about a year after his inpatient treatment and \ndiagnosis. He resumed drinking in either June 2016, as he indicated in his background \ninterview, or at the latest in September 2016 (his birthday), as he testified. His \nsubsequent drinking pattern has been to have two or three drinks at social and family \noccasions, two or three times a week. He also acknowledged consuming \u201ca couple \nmore drinks than my average\u201d while out with business customers. The February 2016 \ndiagnosis was based largely on abstinence as well as continued participation in \ncounseling and a stated desire for continued sobriety. Applicant\u2019s resumed drinking \nundercuts the favorable prognosis he had at the time, and has not been shown to be in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \n \nThe November 2018 assessment does not address Applicant\u2019s diagnosis \nspecifically. The assessor found that Applicant is not at risk to himself or others \nregarding use of alcohol. This is similar to a favorable prognosis, though the LPC does \nnot call it that specifically. However, as the assessment also acknowledges, Applicant \nneeds a safety net of counseling to manage stress and to avoid succumbing to relapse \nand alcohol abuse. That safety net is not in place, though Applicant has expressed a \ndesire to pursue counseling. Without established compliance with such counseling, the \nrisk of relapse remains, as the assessor noted. This is particularly so since Applicant \nhas resumed drinking despite his diagnosis, and despite the recommendation to \ncontinue counseling and abstinence after ADAPT.  \n \n \nApplicant has had a single DUI, though a very serious one. There is no indication \nthat he drinks to intoxication, and there have been no further alcohol-related offenses \nsince. Even so, there is ample Appeal Board precedent for finding that resumed \ndrinking, even moderate drinking, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder, severe, and \nagainst clinical recommendations, can support a conclusion that an applicant has not \ndemonstrated sufficient rehabilitation to overcome the security concerns about his \nalcohol involvement.11 \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s resumed social drinking is against the clinical advice of his ADAPT \nproviders, and he did not sufficiently document that he has received a subsequent \ndiagnosis under which his established pattern of modified consumption of alcohol is in \n                                                          \n11 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00782 at 3 (App. Bd., Feb. 15, 2019); ISCR Case No. 14-05002 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016); ISCR Case No. 04-10457 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007). \n\n \n13 \n \naccordance with treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) do not fully apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol involvement security \nconcerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nHaving observed his demeanor at hearing, I do not doubt that Applicant has been \nsignificantly affected by these events. I am also mindful of his brave and honorable \nservice in uniform for many years and as an F-16 pilot under stressful, dangerous \nconditions, including over combat zones. I also considered the strong whole-person \nevidence provided by his character witnesses.  \n \nBut it is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate the security concerns established by his \nactions and his serious alcohol use disorder. On this record, that is not established. \nApplicant resumed drinking, despite his diagnosis. While his drinking is otherwise \nmoderate, he did not meet his burden to establish at this time that the security concerns \nstemming from his alcohol involvement are fully resolved, or are unlikely to recur. As the \nassessor noted, Applicant needs to have a safety net in place to manage his stress \nlevels and to avoid succumbing to relapse or alcohol abuse. He has indicated an intent \nto resume counseling, but has not yet done so. With time, Applicant may establish a \nsufficient track record of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations, aided by demonstrated participation in sustained \ncounseling. If so, reconsideration may be warranted at a later date. At this time, \nhowever, I am not persuaded that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence to \nestablish that his serious alcohol issues are unlikely to recur, and are no longer a \n\n \n14 \n \nsecurity concern. Overall, the record evidence therefore leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for continued access to classified information is denied. \n \n________________________ \nBraden M.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 24, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 12, 2019. I \n\n \n2 \n \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on April 17, 2019. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 3.1 Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and O. There \nwere no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were admitted into evidence. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on April 30, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He married in \n2011, and has a seven-year-old daughter. He has worked for his current employer since \nApril 2016. Before then he worked in the restaurant business for 15 years.2  \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2016. He \ndisclosed the following information. In 2002, he was charged with possession of \nmarijuana during a traffic stop. He pleaded not guilty, and was found guilty and convicted \nof the charge in 2003. He was sentenced to a year of probation, fines, drug classes, and \ncommunity service. He completed the probation attendance requirements, passed all of \nthe drug tests, attended the drug awareness classes, but failed to complete the \ncommunity service and pay the fines. His probation was revoked. He completed the \ncommunity service, paid the fines, and was ordered to serve 12 days in the county jail for \nthe probation violation. He served six days and the remainder was commuted for good \nbehavior.3  \n \n \nIn 2011, Applicant failed a drug test at work while employed at a hotel resort. He \nhad been injured on the job and sought medical treatment where they administered a \nurinalysis. He tested positive for marijuana.4 \n \n \nIn October 2015, Applicant began working as an undergraduate research assistant \nfor a research laboratory. In April 2016, he was offered a full-time job with the company \nand has been employed there since. Two months later in June 2016, he completed his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA).5  \n \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is Applicant\u2019s request for a continuance and associated documents and email \ncorrespondence. HE II is an excerpt from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th \nEdition (DSM-V). Department Counsel requested I take administrative notice of the sections provided. The \nrequest was granted.  \n \n2 Tr. 24; AE C, D, E. \n \n3 Tr. 38-42, 69-70, 72; GE 1, 2, 3. \n \n4 Tr. 43-44; GE 1, 2. \n \n5 Tr. 45-47. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, he disclosed that he was a regular user of marijuana while in \nhigh school and during his restaurant career from June 1999 to January 2016. He also \npurchased marijuana during this time. He disclosed the following: \n \nThe frequency varied between 1-7 times per week until 2015 when I was \nfinishing college. At this time, I reduced my use to 1-2 times per month, \nknowing that drug use would bar me from employment in my field of study. \nIn 2016, I used once in January in celebration of my graduation and another \nuse during my employment at the University Coop Bookstore working as an \nattendant.6 \n \nSection 23 of the SCA asked if he intended to use this drug or controlled substance in the \nfuture and he replied \u201cno.\u201d He provided the following explanation:  \n \nI am concerned that further use will directly conflict with my employment \nwith a federal contractor. For this, I will avoid further use. Also, I now wish \nto be a better role model for my daughter who is coming to an age where \nshe is very aware and deserves to see that her parents are willing to live \nwell in the face of temptation.7  \n \nApplicant testified that at the time he made the statement on his SCA, his intention \nwas not to use marijuana, and he made the statement in good-faith.8 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2017. He \ndisclosed that since he completed his SCA in June 2016, he had used marijuana \napproximately 20 times. He used it with family and friends. In 2016, he used it on July 4th, \nHalloween, Christmas, New Year\u2019s Eve, and at a friend\u2019s party. He said the reason for his \nuse was because he enjoys it recreationally and as an alternative to alcohol, which upsets \nhis stomach. It relaxes and makes him comfortable. He told the investigator that he would \nprefer to continue using marijuana because he enjoys it and many of his family and friends \nuse it. He continues to associate with them and uses it at their homes. He had not \npurchased marijuana after January 2016, but uses it when provided by his family and \nfriends. He did not intend to purchase it in the future. He did not feel dependent on \nmarijuana. He stated that his marijuana uses has not had any impact on his work, \nfinances, school, home, family or friends, all of whom are aware of his use. He said \nmarijuana use has had no impact on his personality, judgment, reliability, or ability to \nmaintain a confidence.9  \n \n                                                          \n6 GE 1. \n \n7 GE 1. \n \n8 Tr. 28-29. \n \n9 Tr. 47-49; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that when he was interviewed by the investigator he said he had \nused marijuana 20 times since completing his SCA. He stated that his use was between \n10 and 20 times. He confirmed he told the investigator that he preferred to continue using \nmarijuana because he enjoyed using it recreationally, but this was a preference and not \nan intention. He confirmed that at the time he completed his SCA, he told the investigator \nthat he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because he was concerned it would \nimpact federal employment. He testified that he had a few \u201cslips\u201d since completing the \nSCA, and he will avoid future use.10  \n \nApplicant testified that after he was interviewed in June 2017, he received \ngovernment interrogatories and was asked to review the statement he made to the \ninvestigator. He confirmed the accuracy of his statement and signed the interrogatories \nin March 2018. Applicant did not disclose in the interrogatory that he continued to use \nmarijuana after his June 2017 interview until November 2017. He explained his use in \nNovember 2017 was in a social setting with old friends. He said it seemed harmless at \nthe time. He said he has disassociated himself from these friends and others friends who \nuse marijuana. The family members with whom Applicant has used marijuana in the past \nwere his mother and sister. He still associates with them. His wife does not use marijuana. \nHe stated he has not used marijuana since November 2017 because he realized how \nserious his conduct was.11   \n \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant signed a statement of intent to never use illegal drugs again \nand to refrain from associating with drug using individuals and to avoid environments \nwhere drug use is prevalent. He provided negative drug test results from May, August, \nOctober, November 2018, and January and March 2019. Applicant paid for these and \ndecided when to take the tests. The tests were not random and Applicant decided when \nhe would take them. In April 2018, at his request, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \nprofessional counselor for his marijuana use. She diagnosed him under DSM-V with \ncannabis abuse, in remission. He explained that he requested the psychological \nevaluation because he thought it would be valuable to show he was of sound mind and \ncapable of making well thought out decisions. In May 2018, he completed an eight hour \nonline marijuana education program that provided techniques on how to refrain from \nmarijuana use.12  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s May 2018 answer to the SOR, he admitted he used and purchased \nmarijuana from June 1999 to June 2017. He explained that when he began using \nmarijuana he did not know that he would be seeking a security clearance later in his life. \nHe stated that he made the poor decision that the consequences of marijuana use were \nworth the risk. He has now educated himself about marijuana use. He explained that his \nmarijuana use after completing his SCA was a severe lapse in judgment. He believed he \n                                                          \n10 Tr. 47-49. \n \n11 Tr. 30-31, 37-38, 47-58; GE 2. \n \n12 Tr. 30-33, 52-55; AE I, J, L, K. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwas strong enough at the time to abstain but did not make the necessary life changes to \nremain drug free. In times of weakness, he believed that not purchasing marijuana was \nsufficient but then found he used it when it was provided to him by others. He said he did \nnot realize the severe effect his use could have, but he has since realized what is at stake, \nand he will no longer use it. He said that previously he had not taken the necessary steps, \nbut now he has, and there is no likelihood of future drug use. His perception has changed, \nas he has become aware of the costs associated with his drug use and the impact it could \nhave on his family\u2019s finances, especially if he went to jail.13  \n \n \nApplicant was asked if he had attempted to stop using marijuana in the past. He \nstated that he took breaks in his use when he had upcoming job interviews and after his \ndaughter was born. He admitted that the reason he stopped using marijuana before a job \ninterview was because he might have to take a drug test. He said in the past, he had to \ntake pre-employment drug tests and wanted to be clean. He then went back to using \nmarijuana after the test. He also tried to stop after he completed his SCA, but admitted \nhe failed. When asked what has changed, he said the consequence for using it are so \ngreat as well as the loss of his integrity at work. He is aware that possession and use of \nmarijuana is illegal in his state. He used marijuana while working for a defense contractor. \nHe did not know if his supervisor at the time was aware of his drug use. He said that his \nperception of illegal drug use has changed now that he has abstained for a period.14  \n \n \nA coworker who has worked with Applicant for two years testified on his behalf. He \nconsidered Applicant a reliable coworker who has a good reputation and is an important \nmember of their team. Applicant follows all of the required security protocols. They have \nparticipated in activities outside of work that were family oriented. He considers Applicant \nhonest. He believed Applicant was involved in an isolated incident of marijuana use. They \nhave never discussed Applicant\u2019s prior drug use.15 \n \n \nA senior-level employee testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has worked for their \nemployer for 15 years, and he is a project manager. He has worked with Applicant for the \npast three years. They worked on the same project for a year and half and had daily \ncontact. They work on different projects now and see each other about three times a \nweek. He considers Applicant extremely reliable and motivated. He noted that Applicant \nplayed an important role on a project. He said that the team was involved in all types of \nsecurity and protocols, and Applicant was serious about security. The witness testified \nthat he was aware Applicant had some involvement with illegal drugs when he was in \nhigh school in that he was caught with marijuana. The witness was unaware of Applicant\u2019s \nother drug use or while serving on the team. He confirmed that their employer has a drug \npolicy and all employees are made aware of it when they are processed for employment.16  \n                                                          \n13 Tr. 56-57, 70-72; Answer to SOR. \n \n14 Tr. 27-28, 36, 62-68. \n \n15 Tr. 74-83. \n \n16 Tr. 83-94. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a character letter from his supervisor. Applicant had worked for \nhim when he was part of a research project during his senior year of college. His \nsupervisor noted that Applicant\u2019s skillset, trustworthiness and outstanding character \nspurred him to hire him full time after graduation. He was deemed a hard worker, \ncompleting tasks outside of work hours to meet deadlines. Applicant was self-motivated \nand focused, which lead to the success of the project. He was professional, attentive, \npunctual, knowledgeable, honest, and reliable. The supervisor was aware of Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cpast marijuana use.\u201d He noted it did not have an effect on Applicant\u2019s ability to think \nclearly, make professional decisions, and there were no deficiencies in Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and honesty.17  \n \n \nApplicant provided other character letters that state he is reliable, honest, \ntrustworthy, thoughtful and caring. He provided performance evaluations that reflect his \nperformance typically exceeded expectations. He earned his Eagle Scout award in 200118 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n                                                          \n17 AE A. \n \n18 Tr. 33; AE A, G, H, O. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nFrom approximately June 1999 to June 2017, with varying frequency, Applicant \nused and purchased marijuana. He completed his SCA in June 2016 and stated that he \ndid not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He continued to use marijuana after the \ndate he signed his SCA and after the date he was interviewed by a government \ninvestigator in June 2017. He said his last use of marijuana was in November 2017. In \n2011, he tested positive for marijuana after he sought medical assistance from an injury. \nIn 2002, he was charged with possession of marijuana and was convicted in 2003. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \nApplicant has a history of abusing marijuana since 1999. He stopped using \nmarijuana for short periods of time so he could pass employment drug tests and then \nresumed. He used marijuana with friends and also family members, including his mother \nand sister. He honestly disclosed his marijuana use on his June 2016 SCA and said he \nwould not use illegal drugs in the future because of the impact it would have on him \nobtaining a job, and his young daughter. Despite this promise, he continued to use \nmarijuana. He was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2017, and disclosed \nthat he continued recreational use because he enjoyed it. He again promised to refrain \nfrom using marijuana. He broke this promise again and used it after his interview. He said \nhis last marijuana use was November 2017. He was 33 years old at the time.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s past history of marijuana use and his repeated failure to \nabstain, even after completing his SCA and background investigation, I cannot find that \nfuture use is unlikely to recur. Applicant admitted he would abstain from using marijuana \nwhen there was a possibility of drug testing. Although he says he is now committed to \n\n \n9 \n \n \nabstaining because of the potential effect it could have on his job and daughter, those \nsame factors existed after he completed his SCA and background interview. His illegal \ndrug use spans over 18 years and occurred after he was aware that it was a security \nconcern and applied for a security clearance. His conduct casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged his drug involvement. He provided negative drug test \nresults, albeit not random. He has completed an eight-hour online drug program. He says \nhe no longer associates with those who use drugs and has changed his environment, and \nhas provided a statement that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. \nHowever, that statement is not sufficiently persuasive, given his history of failing to adhere \nto his commitments not to use marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies minimally. I have considered \nthat he had a psychological evaluation that indicated his cannabis abuse is in remission, \nbut he did not complete a prescribed drug treatment program or aftercare program. AG \u00b6 \n26(d) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 35 year old husband, father, and exceptional employee. \nHe is also a long term user of marijuana. Despite being charged and convicted of \nmarijuana possession in 2003 and going to jail for six days when he failed to complete \nthe terms of his sentence, it did not serve as a deterrent. The evidence shows that his \nmarijuana use was with family and friends, and he preferred it for recreational use over \n\n \n10 \n \n \nother legal substances. He was aware that those with whom he worked valued his \nknowledge and commitment to their work, and he had an opportunity to further his career \nwith new opportunities. Hence he was sponsored for a security clearance. He made \npromises to abstain from using marijuana after he completed his SCA and after his \nbackground interview. He failed to abstain as promised, despite acknowledging the \npotential work and personal costs that further marijuana abuse could have on his life. \nAlthough Applicant provided some mitigation stating he is now abstaining from marijuana \nuse, has changed his environment, and has disassociated from those who use marijuana, \nthose actions are insufficient to overcome his past conduct and repeated failure to  abstain \nfrom marijuana use. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The SOR also alleged that Applicant owed $15,219 for 11 delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.d \u2013 1.m, 1.o); and that she owed an unspecified balance due on a commercial credit card account (SOR 1.n). In response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant admitted, with explanations and supporting documents, all but one (SOR 1.o) of the allegations.

Those difficulties include unpaid medical bills, \nas well as past-due federal and state income taxes. Although Applicant\u2019s debts arose, in \npart, from events beyond her control, she did not establish that she has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Her request for eligibility to occupy a position of trust is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 29, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (EQIP) to obtain or renew eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position \nfor her job with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, DOD adjudicators were unable to determine that it is clearly \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a position \nof trust, as required by required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section \nE.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2.  \n \n \nOn August 29, 2018, DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts raising trustworthiness concerns addressed through the adjudicative \nguideline (AG) for financial considerations (Guideline F). The current adjudicative \nguidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nThe Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. I received \nthe case on March 11, 2019, and scheduled the hearing for March 28, 2019. The parties \nappeared as scheduled. Department Counsel presented Government Exhibits (GX) 1 - 6. \nApplicant testified and presented Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A. I received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on April 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $12,669 for \nunpaid federal taxes from tax years 2009, and 2011 \u2013 2013. (SOR 1.a) It was also alleged \nthat Applicant did not timely file, as required, her federal income tax returns for tax years \n2009 through 2016 (SOR 1.b); and that she failed to pay her state income taxes for the \n2008, 2009, and 2012 tax years, with the 2008 and 2009 tax debts having been satisfied \nthrough levy on her employment wages (SOR 1.c). The SOR also alleged that Applicant \nowed $15,219 for 11 delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.d \u2013 1.m, 1.o); and that she owed an \nunspecified balance due on a commercial credit card account (SOR 1.n). \n \n \nIn response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant admitted, with explanations and \nsupporting documents, all but one (SOR 1.o) of the allegations. With her Answer, \nApplicant provided copies of her 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns. They were \nnot signed or dated. (Tr. 14)  \n \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following \nfindings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old and employed by a defense contractor in a \nposition that requires eligibility for a position of trust. Applicant works as a claims \nprocessor for a company that supports management of the health care system used by \nmembers of the military, and her duties include safeguarding personally identifiable \ninformation (PII) associated with the health care system\u2019s constituents. She has worked \nfor her current employer since October 1996, and she has held a public trust position \nsince at least 2004. (GX 1; Tr. 37 \u2013 38) \n \n \nThe allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her federal income tax \nreturns between 2009 and 2016 are based on her disclosures in response to tax and \nfinance questions in her e-QIP. At or near the time of her September 2017 subject \ninterview by a government investigator, Applicant provided information that shows she \ntimely filed her 2014 return and owed no additional taxes. At her hearing, she presented \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ninformation that shows her 2013 return was timely filed, but it was rejected due to errors \nby the person who prepared the return. That year, Applicant received an erroneous \n$6,000 refund that she had to repay. Applicant\u2019s information at hearing showed that the \ntotal federal income tax debt alleged has been reduced to $2,568, and that her refunds, \nmost recently for tax year 2016, have been applied to the debts for tax years 2009, 2011, \nand 2012. Her remaining tax debt is for 2012 alone. This information implies that \nApplicant\u2019s returns for those years have, as she has claimed, been filed. (Answer; GX 1; \nGX 2; AX A; Tr. 27 \u2013 28, 30 \u2013 34) \n \n \nIn her e-QIP, Applicant also disclosed her state income debts for the 2008, 2009, \nand 2012 tax years. Available information further shows that only her 2012 debt remains \nunresolved. That debt is being enforced through a February 2017 tax lien for $1,233. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 34, 48 \u2013 50) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of income tax problems. A 2003 signed, sworn statement \nfrom a previous subject interview showed she had incurred numerous delinquent or past-\ndue debts, including federal and state income tax debts totaling about $4,650. She \naverred therein that her financial problems stemmed from circumstances beyond her \ncontrol, such as surgery and a car accident. As to her taxes, most often, Applicant testified \nthat she failed to timely file her income tax returns, usually because she knew she could \nnot afford to pay any additional taxes. Applicant\u2019s taxes due after her returns usually \nresulted from the fact that she claimed nine exemptions from withholding. This practice \nresults in higher paychecks, but also requires payment of those taxes with her returns. \nApplicant still claims nine exemptions from withholding. (GX 6; Tr. 44 \u2013 50, 65 \u2013 67) \n \n \nIn her e-QIP, Applicant disclosed numerous unpaid medical bills. For the most part, \nher medical debts (SOR 1.d \u2013 1.m, 1.o total $15,219) are for services provided to her and \nher family over the past several years. The largest of her medical debts (SOR 1.d for \n$9,099) is for Applicant\u2019s hospitalization for cardiac care. Applicant has always had \nemployer-provided medical insurance, albeit, with high deductibles. SOR 1.d aside, she \nhas not explained why she did not pay her other more moderate bills. Applicant also has \nnot taken any discernable action to pay or otherwise resolve any of her medical debts. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 34, 50 \u2013 51, 68 \u2013 70) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have been married since June 2005, and they have \ntwo children (ages 11 and 13). Applicant had financial problems before they were married, \nbut she avers her current debt is largely due to her husband\u2019s drinking and gambling. \nHowever, Applicant testified that her husband\u2019s vices have not been an issue for them \nsince 2008. More recently, he has had sporadic employment since 2016 which, in 2018, \ncaused them to fall behind on their mortgage and lose a car to repossession. Applicant \nhas not sought any professional financial counseling or other assistance, but she testified \nthat, now that her husband is again employed, they can afford to file, and would be able \nto make payments under, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection \u201cto save the house.\u201d She \nindicated they would file such a petition a few days after her hearing. (Answer; GX 1; GX \n2; Tr. 28 \u2013 29, 35, 40 \u2013 42, 60 \u2013 63, 70 \u2013 71) \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant\u2019s husband was injured in a car accident and had to leave his \njob of 25 years without retirement benefits. In 2016, he received a $59,000 settlement \nfrom that accident. In July 2016, Applicant and her husband paid $10,000 down on a new \nhouse, financing the remaining $80,000 with a mortgage. After paying for repairs and \nother costs associated with that purchase, they had about $45,000 remaining. In August \n2016, Applicant and her family went on a one-week cruise. Applicant did not specify for \nwhat other purposes they used the settlement funds. Applicant\u2019s current finances are not \nsound. She has incurred additional unpaid debts over the past year, and her checking \naccount was overdrawn by about $400 as of the day of her hearing. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 44, \n51 \u2013 59, 63 \u2013 64) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do so. All such adjudications \nmust adhere to the procedural protections in the Directive before any adverse \ndetermination may be made. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the adjudicative \nguidelines. (See, Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors, \ncommonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, listed in the guidelines at AG \u00b6 2(d) \nas follows: \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case \ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or \ndenial of eligibility for a position of trust. \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a position of \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has access to \nsensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on \ntrust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nprotect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access should be resolved in favor of the Government. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe facts established by this record reasonably raise a trustworthiness concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is addressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so); 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); \nand 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \n \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions is supported by this record. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems and her tax reporting and payment difficulties have persisted over \nmuch of the past 15 years. For the most part, they remain unresolved. As to her income \ntax filings, it is likely that all of her returns have now been filed; however, Applicant still \nclaims an excessive number of exemptions from withholding for a household of four. She \nwill likely incur another income tax bill she cannot afford, in light of available information \nabout her current finances. Given her long-term conduct in this regard, it is also more \nlikely than not that she will decide not file her income tax returns when she knows she \ncannot pay the resulting tax bill.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose, in part, from unusual or unforeseen \ncircumstances. Of note is her husband\u2019s sporadic employment history and issues \nregarding alcohol and gambling. Additionally, it appears Applicant has had some medical \nissues in the past few years. Nonetheless, although she claimed that her husband\u2019s \ngambling and drinking caused them financial problems, his conduct ceased more than \nten years ago. As to his employment problems, available information shows that Applicant \nand her husband did not make reasonable financial decisions when he was employed, \nleaving them unable to deal with contingencies. As to her medical problems, Applicant \ndid not present sufficient information showing that she has tried to address those debts \nin any meaningful way. Applicant did not establish that she has acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. To the contrary, Applicant and her husband failed to use the $45,000 \nremaining from his accident settlement to pay any of the debts at issue in this case. On \nbalance, Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \n \n \nI have evaluated the facts and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors \nunder Guideline F. I also have reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-\nperson factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s finances remain a trustworthiness concern \nbecause she has not shown over the past 15 years that she is able or willing to \nresponsibly fulfill her income tax and other financial obligations. Her continued conduct in \nthis regard sustains the doubts about her judgment, reliability and trustworthiness that is \nraised by the Government\u2019s information. Because protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant. \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to occupy a position of trust. Applicant\u2019s request for public trust \neligibility is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 1, 2017. On \nMarch 27, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF, based on his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns. The DOD CAF \nacted under Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to an administrative judge on September \n01/09/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n27, 2018. On September 28, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for November 7, 2018. The case was \nreassigned to me on October 31, 2018, and I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through T,1 which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 16, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He was \nemployed by defense contractors from June 1981 to February 2002. He worked as a \ncivilian employee of the U.S. Navy from February 2002 to March 2008. He has worked as \na program manager for a defense contractor from April 2008 until the present. He has \nheld a security clearance since 1981.  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1981. He has \ncompleted graduate course work in metallurgical engineering but has not received a \ngraduate degree. He married in October 1981. He and his wife have four adult children.  \n \n \nApplicant did not timely file his federal and state income tax returns from 2008 \nthrough 2016. He relied on his concept of a \u201cthree-year rule,\u201d under which he could file a \nreturn and receive a refund without penalty within three years of the due date for a tax \nreturn. His understanding of the \u201cthree-year-rule\u201d was based on his own research and not \non advice from a tax professional. His plan was to delay filing each year\u2019s return until he \nwas certain that his refund from a previous year was sufficient to cover any taxes due. \n(Tr. 18-19, 28.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant filed an SCA in April 2012, seeking to continue his clearance, he \ndisclosed that he had not timely filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2008, \n2009, and 2010, and that he owed a total of about $18,361 for 2008; $12,828 for 2009; \nand $6,061 for 2010. He explained that, due to \u201cunorganized business accounting,\u201d he \ndid not have the required forms to support filing his returns on time. He also explained \nthat he paid estimated taxes but had miscalculated the amount of taxes due. (GX 2 at 32-\n33.) During a personal subject interview (PSI) in April 2012, he told an investigator that \nhe was concerned about the impact of the tax issues on his security clearance, that he \nhad retained a tax consultant and a bookkeeper to assist him with his tax and returns, \nand that he expected to file all past-due returns by the end of May 2012. (GX 4 at 6.) He \n                                                          \n1 Applicant submitted AX A through Q with his answer to the SOR. He resubmitted them at the hearing, \nalong with AX R, S, and T.

(Tr. 30.)  \n \nWhen Applicant responded to financial interrogatories from the DOD CAF in June \n2014, he provided federal and state tax transcripts for 2008 through 2011. The transcripts \nreflected that he filed his state return for 2008 in April 2012 and federal return for 2008 in \nJune 2012. (GX 4 at 16, 24.) He filed his state return for 2009 in July 2012 and his federal \nreturn for 2009 in August 2012. (GX 4 at 18, 29-30.) He filed his state return for 2010 in \nJuly 2012 and his federal return for 2010 in August 2012. (GX 4 at 19, 33-37.) He filed his \nstate return for 2011 in February 2013 and his federal return for 2011 in June 2014. (GX \n4 at 22, 45.) At the end of the interrogatories, he commented: \n \nI would like to emphasize that while my returns were late, it is because I \nassumed I had a refund coming and there are no penalties for late personal \nreturns. . . However, it is clear to me now that the late filings are poorly \nregarded from an investigation standpoint. I have hired a new tax advisor to \nhelp me keep up with the process.  \n \n(GX 4 at 8.) Notwithstanding his failures to timely file his federal and state tax returns, his \nsecurity clearance was never suspended or revoked. (Tr. 36.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in March 2017, he disclosed that \nhe had failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for 2010 through 2015. \n(GX 1 at 35-38.) In response to interrogatories from the DOD CAF in February 2018, he \nsubmitted tax transcripts reflecting that he filed his federal return for 2012 in June 2016, \nhis federal return for 2013 in August 2016, and his federal return for 2014 in August 2016. \n(GX 3 at 5-8.) He submitted an account history from the state tax authority reflecting that \nhis state returns for 2011 through 2014 had been filed. (GX 3 at 15.) He submitted copies \nof his federal and state returns for 2015 and 2016, along with evidence that the federal \nreturns for 2015 and 2016 were mailed in June 2018 and the state returns for 2015 and \n2016 were personally delivered to the state revenue authority in January 2018. (GX 3 at \n9-14, 16-19.) At the end of these interrogatories, he commented, \n \nRegarding reasons for my late filing, in the past since I knew I had a refund \ncoming I would wait to file my return to make sure the following year was \nadequately covered with withholding, estimated taxes, or prior tax year carry \nover. I only offer this as my rationale as to why there were late. I did not fully \nappreciate the impact of delinquent returns on my clearance eligibility. It is \nclear to me now that the late filings are poorly regarded from a clearance \nstandpoint. [To] help ensure timely returns going forward, I am now working \nwith a tax preparation company in my town to help with the process. I have \nalready met with the [name redacted] tax preparation service and discussed \npreparation plans for my 2017 return, which I am currently preparing and \nwill file on time. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n(GX 3 at 4.) He received an extension of time to file his federal income tax return for 2017 \nand filed it in July 2018. (AX T.) He filed his state income tax return, which was due on \nMay 1, 2018, on June 9, 2018. (AX I.) The record does not reflect whether he requested \nand received an extension of time to file his state return for 2017. \n \n \nIn October 2018, Applicant executed a \u201cStatement of Intent,\u201d declaring his intent \nto never again fail to untimely file his federal and state income tax returns, and agreeing \nthat any future failures to time file or pay taxes would be grounds to revoke his national \nsecurity eligibility. (AX S.) In November 2018, Applicant hired a business-advising \ncompany to help him with tax planning and compliance. (AX R.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is about $94,000. (Tr. 16.) He testified that between 2008 \nand 2016, he usually received a tax refund. (Tr. 22.) He is financially secure. At the time \nof the hearing, he had $2,400 in his checking account. (AX N.) In June 2018, he \ncompleted an online credit-counseling course, a budget analysis, and a financial action \nplan. (AX O; AX P.) As part of the budget analysis, he indicated that he has monthly \nincome of about $10,312; expenses of about $9,855; and a net remainder of about $457. \n(AX P.) This information was generally consistent with a personal financial statement that \nhe submitted with his answer to the SOR. (AX M.) A credit report from June 2018 reflects \nno negative information. (AX Q.) \n \n \nFour former and current coworkers submitted letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They \ndescribe him as an outstanding mentor; a skilled, personable, dedicated, and respected \nengineer; and a dedicated spouse and parent. They consider him a person of high \nintegrity and honesty, who is truthful and forthright, even under difficult or stressful \nconditions. (AX A.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n6 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted by the parties \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s tax delinquencies were numerous, \nrecent, and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Applicant\u2019s \nrepeated failures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns, after admitting in \nthe 2012 PSI that he knew his delinquent returns raised security concerns, cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant has received financial counseling and tax \nadvice, and all past-due tax returns have been filed.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable because failure to pay taxes was not alleged in the \nSOR. However, I have noted that the delinquent taxes for tax years 2008 through 2010 \nhave been paid. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant has filed all past-due federal and state tax \nreturns and paid all taxes due. However, his belated resolution of his tax delinquencies \ndoes not end the inquiry. A security clearance adjudication is not a tax-enforcement \nprocedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nThe fact that Applicant has filed his past-due returns \u201cdoes not preclude careful \nconsideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Furthermore, the \nestablishment of some mitigating evidence does not compel a favorable security-\nclearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14784 (App. Bd. Jan.17, 2014). \n \nEven if Applicant honestly believed that the \u201cthree-year rule\u201d exempted him from \ntimely filing his federal and state tax returns for 2008 through 2011, he acknowledged his \nobligation to file and awareness of the security implications of failing to file in the April \n2012 PSI and his responses to DOD CAF interrogatories in June 2014. Yet he continued \nhis pattern of untimely filing through tax year 2016. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-\n00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local \n473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). His \nstatement of intent to timely file his future tax returns and his timely filing of his 2017 \nfederal return are insufficient to overcome his long history of untimely filings. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \n                                                          \n3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nrepeated failures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 5, 2018 and October 9, 2018, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department \n04/01/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant \nreceived it on January 15, 2019. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the \nFORM. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant did not \nsubmit a response to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s documents. Items 1 \nthrough 6 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on March 27, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l, and denied the \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He attended college for approximately two years, but did \nnot earn a degree. He married in 2014, and has a four-year-old child. He served in the \nArmy Reserve from March 2006 to May 2016, and was honorably discharged. He has \nbeen employed by a federal contractor since February 2017.1  \n \nIn his June 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), Applicant \ndisclosed his work history and periods of unemployment: he worked part-time from \nFebruary 2006 to April 2010, and was a drilling reservist from March 2006 to April 2010; \nactive duty from April 2010 to February 2013; unemployed from February 2013 to April \n2014; active duty from April 2014 to May 2016; and unemployed from May 2016 to \nFebruary 2017.2  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to Section 26 of his SF 86 that requested information about \nfinancial delinquencies, he disclosed one debt owed to a satellite television service in the \namount of $173. He noted that it would be paid immediately. No other debts turned over \nto a collection agency, defaulted loans or debts that had been delinquent over 120 days \nor were currently over 120 days delinquent were disclosed.3  \n \nIn December 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment after being discharged from \nthe military. He took a job with a federal contractor working overseas so he could address \nthose financial problems. He intended to pay all of his delinquent debts. In his answer to \neach debt alleged in the SOR, he stated: \u201cI admit. However, the conditions occurred under \nunique such circumstances that are unlikely to recur and should not cast doubt on my \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d4 \n \n                                                          \n1 Item 3. \n \n2 Item 3. \n \n3 Item 3. \n \n4 Item 2, 4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant further disclosed to the investigator that in February and March 2017, he \nwas unable to pay his rent. His wife was working at the time, but he was not. Her income \nwas insufficient. He arranged a payment plan with the landlord to pay the overdue rent.5  \n \nApplicant disclosed to the investigator that in July 2014, he received notice that \nbecause he failed to return his apartment\u2019s pool pass he owed $30. He was employed at \nthis time, but his wife was not. He did not have the money to pay that debt. He was notified \nby mail in July 2014 that the debt was turned over to a collection company. He intended \nto pay the debt in January 2018. He told the investigator that he was now earning $85,000 \ntax free while he was working in Kuwait. He forgot to list this debt when he completed his \nSF 86.6 \n \nApplicant told the investigator that he owed approximately $18,000 to the DOD \ndue to an overpayment made to him for a period of six months. He said that he was \nreleased from the military in May 2016, but he did not receive his official DD 214 discharge \ndocument until September 2016. He said he continued to receive pay from May 2016 to \nSeptember 2016. He said he did not think anything of the fact that he was still receiving \npay. After he received his DD 2014 the pay stopped. He said he thought this was normal.  \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant was notified by the Defense Financial and Accounting \nService about the overpayment and informed that he owed $18,000. Applicant did not \ntake action to repay this debt because he did not have the money. He told the investigator \nthat he did not have the address to contact the creditor for this debt. He intended to obtain \na copy of his credit report to obtain the information. He believed the debt may have been \nturned over to a collection company. He intended to repay the debt in full beginning in \nJanuary 2018. He reiterated to the investigator that his current income was $85,000, and \nhe planned to use his income to repay all of his debts. He failed to disclose this debt on \nhis SF 86 because he forgot about it. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$17,655). Applicant did not provide \nevidence that he has made arrangements to repay this debt. \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($10,409), 1.c ($8,866), 1.d ($7,692) 1.e ($5,780) and \n1.h ($589) are credit card debts, and the debt in \u00b6 1.g ($820) is owed to a furniture store. \nThe debts were incurred while Applicant was unemployed from May 2016 to February \n2017. He used the credit cards to pay living expenses. During this period, Applicant was \nunable to pay the credit cards and furniture store. He told the investigator that the credit \ncards were in collections. He said he did not have a payment plan, and he could not afford \nto pay the debts. He planned to use his salary to repay the debts. He intended to obtain \na credit report and start making payments on the debts in January 2018. He failed to \n                                                          \n5 Item 4. I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any derogatory information that was not alleged \nin the SOR. I may consider information when making a credibility determination, in the application of \nmitigating conditions, and in my whole-person analysis. \n \n6 Item 4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndisclose these debts on his SF 86 because he forgot them. He did not provide any \ninformation about the status of these debts. They are unresolved.7 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($96) is a medical debt owed for services provided to \nApplicant\u2019s daughter in May 2016. Applicant told the investigator he was unable to pay \nthe debt when it was due. He said that it was still unresolved, but he would use his salary \nas a federal contractor to pay it. He did not provide evidence the debt is paid.  \n \nApplicant was confronted by the investigator with the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($176); \n1.k ($1,464), and 1.l ($80). He said he was unfamiliar with these accounts. He told the \ninvestigator he would obtain a credit report and begin contacting creditors and establish \npayment plans.  \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR, statements to the government investigator, and \ncredit reports from July 2017 and February 2018.8  \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally failed to disclose on his June 2017 SF 86 \nthat he had debts turned over to a collection agency; had a credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or canceled for failing to pay as agreed; in the past seven years had been \nover 120 days delinquent on any debt; or was currently over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt. His answer stated: \u201cI used a credit report pulled that same day. However, I was \nunaware that the report was incomplete or inaccurate.\u201d9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n                                                          \n7 Item 4. \n \n8 Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. \n \n9 Item 2.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation.10 \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n  \n \nApplicant has 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $56,813 that are \nunresolved. He told the investigator he intended to pay the debts because he was now \nworking for a federal contractor. No evidence was provided to show he has resolved any \nof the debts. There is sufficient evidence to establish the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n                                                          \n10 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App.Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant has 12 delinquent debts that are unresolved. He attributed his financial \nproblems to periods of unemployment. Despite telling the government investigator in \nDecember 2017 that he was now employed and would pay his delinquent debts, he failed \nto provide evidence that he has taken any action to resolve them. Applicant\u2019s failure to \npay his financial obligations casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond is control, but he failed to act responsibly \nafter he obtained employment. Despite his promise to pay the delinquent debts after he \nstarted working, he failed to show he has taken action. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. There \nis no evidence he has participated in financial counseling, and there are no clear \nindications his financial problems are being resolved or under control. There is no \nevidence that he made good-faith efforts to pay or resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nI have considered that Applicant was an experienced military drilling reservist and \nserved on active duty for two extended periods. Although he should have been aware \nthat he was not eligible to receive pay when he was not serving, I am unable to conclude \nhe knowingly and willfully accepted unearned pay from the DOD. I find in his favor for \nSOR \u00b6 2.a.  \n \nApplicant was unemployed from May 2016 until February 2017, and used credit \ncards to pay his expenses that he could not afford to pay. He acknowledged to the \ninvestigator that he knew some of his accounts were in collection. He was notified in \nJanuary 2017 that he was overpaid by the DOD, and he owed $18,000. He said he \naccepted a federal contractor job to work overseas so he could address his financial \n\n \n8 \n \n \nproblems. He said he forgot to list these debts on his SF 86. Applicant was aware he was \nnot working and was using credit cards to pay expenses for a period of time. His \nexplanation that he forgot about the delinquent debts he was required to disclose is not \ncredible. I find he deliberately failed to disclose that he had delinquent debts and some \nthat had been turned over to collection agencies or were currently past due more than \n120 days. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.b.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 17(a). There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that Applicant made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his \nomissions prior to being confronted by the investigator.  \n \nApplicant was aware he had numerous delinquent debts and deliberately failed to \ndisclose them. The government relies on people to be forthcoming and honest on their \nSF 86, even when there is derogatory information in their history. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply because Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information on his SF 86 and \ncertifying its accuracy are not minor offenses. I find Applicant\u2019s omissions are serious and \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. He experienced financial problems when he was \nunemployed. He told the government investigator that he was now employed by a federal \ncontractor working overseas and his income was tax free. He intended to use his income \nto repay his delinquent debts. He failed to provide evidence that he has resolved any of \nthe alleged delinquent debts. When Applicant completed his SF 86, he was aware he had \ndebts that were in collections or delinquent, but he deliberately failed to disclose them. \nHe has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes his use of marijuana from about July 2000 to at least October 2017; including from about 2010 to October 2017, while holding a security clearance. Applicant attended college from 2005 to 2010. He stated that during college he used marijuana one time. After graduating, in February 2010, he was hired by his current employer, a defense contractor, and applied for a security clearance which he was granted. Applicant testified that when he completed the security clearance questionnaire in 2010, he did not intend on ever using marijuana again. (Tr. p. 20.) From 2010 to 2017, while holding a security clearance, Applicant used marijuana on at least four separate occasions. He stated that he used it with friends at social events.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Jessica Coronado, Esq.  \n \n \nFebruary 5, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 22, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance applications (e-QIP). \n(Government Exhibit 1.)  On May 2, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse.  The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 25, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 5, 2018.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 15, \n2018, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 4, 2018.  The \nGovernment offered two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection. The Applicant offered seven exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A through G, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 13, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old.  He is not married and has no children.  He has a \nBachelor\u2019s of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering.  He is employed by a defense \ncontractor as an Engineer.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment.    \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.  Applicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes his use of \nmarijuana from about July 2000 to at least October 2017; including from about 2010 to \nOctober 2017, while holding a security clearance.    \n \n \nApplicant attended college from 2005 to 2010.   He stated that during college he \nused marijuana one time.  After graduating, in February 2010, he was hired by his \ncurrent employer, a defense contractor, and applied for a security clearance which he \nwas granted.  Applicant testified that when he completed the security clearance \nquestionnaire in 2010, he did not intend on ever using marijuana again.  (Tr. p. 20.)   \n \n \nFrom 2010 to 2017, while holding a security clearance, Applicant used marijuana \non at least four separate occasions.   He stated that he used it with friends at social \nevents.  On at least two occasions, he stated to the investigator that he used marijuana \ndue to peer pressure.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  Throughout this period, Applicant \nreceived annual security briefings at work, and was aware of DoD policy as well as his \ncompany policy prohibiting the use of illegal drugs while holding a security clearance.  \n(Tr. pp. 37 - 38.) \n   \n \nIn June 2017, Applicant completed another security clearance application, and \nwas later interviewed by an investigator on August 15, 2017.  On the application and \nduring the interview, Applicant expressed his intent to continue to use marijuana in the \nfuture.   At the hearing, Applicant testified that he no longer intends to use marijuana.  \nHe states that he now realizes his poor choices in the past concerning his illegal drug \nuse.  To try and be a better person he voluntarily enrolled in a 16-hour, two-day course, \ncalled \u201cPrimed for Life\u201d sponsored by the Marine Corps.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)  He \nstates that it was an eye-opener for him.  (Tr. p. 23.)        \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Statement of Intent dated December 3, 2018, swearing to \nnever use marijuana or any other illegal substance again.  He stated that he now \nunderstands the seriousness of his illegal drug use while holding a security clearance.  \n\n \n3 \n \nHe states that he no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs, or anyone \nwho places him in situations where marijuana is freely available, except his brother.  He \nfurther states that any future misuse of any illegal drug will be grounds for immediate \nrevocation of his national security eligibility.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \n      \n \nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s lead engineer dated November 1, 2018, indicates \nthat Applicant exhibits good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  He is described \nas a great asset to the team.   He is recommended for a security clearance.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)   \n \n \nA letter from a coworker dated November 6, 2018, who has worked with the \nApplicant since 2011, reflects that Applicant is considered to be an excellent, \ndependable, honest, and responsible employee.  Applicant is known to always follow \nproper procedures in protecting classified information.  He still works in the classified \narea on a weekly basis.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)      \n \n \nPerformance reviews of the Applicant for the period from January 1, 2015, \nthrough December 31, 2015, reflects that he \u201cconsistently exceeds expectations.\u201d  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n \n \nApplicant underwent three drug tests on October 3, 2018; November 7, 2018; \nand November 27, 2018, which all show negative results for illegal drugs.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit F.) \n \n \nA letter from a friend of the Applicant, who has known him for the past five years, \nstated that she has only known Applicant to partake in the use of illegal drugs on one \noccasion.  She believes he is a man of integrity, honesty and accountability.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant is not a \nyoung and immature man, with little experience in the defense industry.  In fact, he is 31 \nyears old and has worked in the defense industry for his current employer for the past \neight years.  After receiving a security clearance in 2010, he continued to use marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance.  He last used marijuana in 2017, about a year and a \nhalf ago.  Applicant was aware of DoD policy and his company\u2019s zero tolerance drug \npolicy, but chose to defy the policies by using marijuana after being granted a security \nclearance.  There is no excuse for this misconduct, and his actions do no show the \nrequisite good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for \naccess to classified information.        \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is well respected on the job and is \nconsidered to be an excellent engineer.  However, he has failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to demonstrate that he meets the qualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 28, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2018, and he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice of hearing on October 18, 2018, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on November 27, 2018. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \n01/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nidentified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, but offered no exhibits. The \nrecord remained open until December 31, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit \ndocumentary evidence. He failed to submit any additional evidence.1 DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 7, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions are incorporated into these \nfindings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in January 2017. In addition to his contractor job, he works part time \nfor a local restaurant. He served in the Air Force for 20 years, honorably retiring as a \nstaff sergeant (paygrade E-5). He deployed to Afghanistan where he was assigned to \nan Army unit. He received the Combat Action Badge (CAB) for his actions while \ndeployed. He is a high school graduate. He is married, but currently separated from his \nwife. He has a 12-year-old daughter. His daughter has anxiety issues and therefore only \nattends school part time. She participates in on-line home schooling the rest of the time. \nFor this reason, Applicant\u2019s wife stays home with their daughter.2  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts totaling approximately $22,783. The debts \nwere listed in credit reports from June 2017, and March 2018 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.p).3  \n \n \nApplicant explained that his financial difficulties started in approximately 2012 \nwhen he was still in the Air Force. He received an administrative reduction in rank and \nhis wife was unemployed. As a result of their reduced income, the family had a difficult \ntime paying their bills. During his background investigation in October 2017, Applicant \nwas confronted with his delinquent debts. He acknowledged most of them and stated he \nwould get with a debt-consolidation company to work on resolving them. He failed to \nproduce evidence of any such subsequent action by him.4   \n \n \nDuring his testimony, he admitted that he failed to contact any of his creditors or \nto take any action to resolve his debts, with two exceptions. He claims the credit-card \ndebt in the amount of $2,274 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) is being paid from his military retirement \naccount. He did not provide supporting documentation, but his March 2018 credit report \nshows a balance reduction as compared to the balance shown on his June 2017 credit \nreport. He also claimed he is making payments toward the consumer debt listed in SOR \n                                                          \n1 I directed Department Counsel to contact Applicant to inquire whether he submitted any \nmaterial. On January 11, 2019, she sent Applicant an email at his confirmed email address (See HE II). \nAs of January 23, 2018, no reply was received from Applicant. \n \n2 Tr. at 5, 15-16; GE 1. \n \n3 GE 4-5. \n \n4 Tr. at 16-17; GE 2. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n\u00b6 1.e. He failed to supply any supporting documentation showing those payments. His \nremaining debts are unresolved.5  \n \n \nApplicant did not produce a budget, but indicated that after paying all his monthly \nbills, he retained approximately $600-$700 at the end of every month. He plans to use \nthis excess and the money he receives from his second job to pay his delinquent debts. \nHe believes he just needs more time to take care of his debts. He failed to produce any \ndocumentation showing progress toward resolving his debts when the record was kept \nopen for 30 days.6 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 23-25; GE 4-5. \n \n6 Tr. at 28, 38, 40. \n \n\n \n4 \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.   \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. I find both the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n5 \n \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and multiple. He has not resolved any of the SOR \ndebts. He is making payments from his military retirement account toward one debt. He \nfailed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s unemployment, caused by their daughter\u2019s medical issues, can \nbe considered a circumstance beyond his control. However, he failed to act responsibly \nby establishing payment plans for the identified debts. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not support that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis partially applicable.  \n \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. Given the unpaid \nstatus of his debts, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control and good-faith \nefforts to pay or resolve the remaining debts are lacking. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not \napply. Applicant is making payments on one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m) and AG \u00b6 20(d) applies \nto that debt. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n6 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s federal contractor service and his military service. \nHowever, I also considered that he has made insufficient efforts to resolve his debts. He \nhas not established a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to \nquestion his ability to resolve his debts.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.7   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.n - 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\n      For Applicant: Pro se      \n_____________\n Decision\n  ______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated personal conduct concerns regarding falsification allegations, but failed to\nmitigate the security concerns regarding his drug involvement and substance misuse. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn June 15, 2018, Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications\nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOD\nadjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a security\nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nWithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/01/2019\n\n       Applicant responded to the SOR on July 2, 2018, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on August 30, 2018, interposed no objections to the materials in the\nFORM, and did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on January 2,\n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly used marijuana, with varying frequency,\nfrom about 1975 to at least May 2017. Allegedly, he stated in his response to DOHA\ninterrogatories that he may continue its use on a very rare basis.\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR (a) cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s marijuana involvement\ncovered by Guideline H and (b) alleges that Applicant falsified his electronic\nquestionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) of August 2016 by deliberately\nomitting his past marijuana use. Allegedly, he failed to disclose his marijuana use from\nabout 1975 to at least May 2017.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by\nGuideline H with explanations. He claimed that as a private citizen he is free to live his life\nwithin the laws of his state and country and found difficulty in seeing marijuana as an\nillegal substance as a resident of a state where recreational marijuana is legal. He\nclaimed that he could not say with 100% certainty that he will never use marijuana again.\nApplicant also claimed that he may use marijuana on a rare basis, but will never use it\nduring any activity associated with work or job assignments.\nAddressing the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant admitted the\nincorporated allegations of drug involvement and the allegation of omission, but did not\nconsider marijuana a controlled substance at the time he completed the e-QIP. He\nclaimed he now knows that marijuana is covered by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 862 and considers\nmarijuana to be a controlled substance. \n    \nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 61-year-old senior project manager for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional\nfindings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married in February 1980 and divorced in June 1987. (Item 3) He \nremarried in June 1995 and separated from his wife in August 2009. (Items 2-3) He has\nno children from either marriage. (Items 2-3) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nJune 1991. (Items 2-3) He enlisted in the Air Force in August 1976 and served three\nyears of active duty. He was honorably discharged in February 1979.\n2\n\nSince April 2010, Applicant has worked for his current employer. Previously, he\nworked for other employers as a software engineer. (Items 2-4). He held a security\nclearance while in the Air Force, but not since his discharge in 1979. (Items 2- 3) \nApplicant\u2019s drug use\nApplicant was introduced to marijuana at the age of 17 and used it on and off once\nor twice a year between 1975 and May 2017. (Item 4) He last used marijuana in May\n2017 with a sailing crew partner, but has used it before with a female friend. Both the\nsailing partner and friend freely supplied marijuana for his use. (Item 4) He used the drug\nto relax, taking two to three puffs at a time. (Item 4)\nIn an interview with an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in\nJune 2017, Applicant told the agent that he will use marijuana in the future whenever he\nfeels like it and has no intention of stopping his marijuana use. (Item 4) Asked by the\ninterviewing agent whether he feels he has a drug problem, he answered in the negative.\nHe assured the agent that he has never needed drug counseling or treatment. (Item 4)\nAnd he acknowledged using marijuana while previously possessing a security clearance\nduring his Air Force enlistment. Applicant posited that his infrequent marijuana use never\naffected his judgment, reliability, or ability to hold the confidence of others he interacts\nwith.\nE-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in August 2016, Applicant omitted his past use of\nmarijuana when replying to the information requested about his past drug use in section\n23 of the e-QIP. He denied making intentional omissions and attributed his e-QIP\nomissions to his belief that marijuana use was not illegal in his state of residence. (Item 4)\nAcceptance of Applicant\u2019s explanation requires a credibility check. To his credit, he\nacknowledged using marijuana between January 2004 and January 2011 in the e-QIP he\ncompleted in January 2011. (Item 2) And when asked about any prior marijuana use in an\ninterview with an OPM agent in June 2017, he voluntarily  acknowledged his past\nmarijuana use without being confronted by the interviewing agent about his previous e-\nQIP omissions. \nApplicant has continued to deny any deliberate omissions of his past marijuana\nuse in the e-QIP he completed in 2016. (Item 4) His explanations implicitly reflect\nmisunderstandings about the disparate rules governing marijuana use in his state of\nresidence and the federal rules covering marijuana use and drug activity in the United\nStates. His mistaken understandings, while not fully developed, are plausible enough to\nwarrant acceptance. To his credit also, he was up-front about his marijuana use when\ninitially asked about his drug use in his earlier 2011 e-QIP, and when subsequently asked\nabout his marijuana use in his June 2017 OPM interview. \n3\n\nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s omissions of his past marijuana use in his August 2016 do\nnot reflect knowing and wilful omissions of past marijuana use. Allegations of falsification\nof his August 2016 e-QIP are not substantiated. \nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the conditions that could\nmitigate security concerns. These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether\nor not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines\nis to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6\n2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a\n4\n\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations \nAG \u00b6 24.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure\nto provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess. . . AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n5\n\nAnalysis  \nApplicant presents as a senior project manager for a defense contractor who\nseeks a security clearance. Principal security issues in this case center on Applicant\u2019s\nrecurrent use of marijuana (a controlled substance whose use is banned by federal law\nand DoD\u2019s anti-drug policy) Additional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s\nomissions of his marijuana use in the e-QIP he completed in August 2016. \nDrug involvement and substance misuse concerns\nOver a number of years spanning 1975 and May 2017, Applicant used marijuana\nrecurrently. On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying conditions of\nthe AGs for drug involvement and substance abuse are applicable: DC \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany\nsubstance misuse,\u201d and DC \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance,\nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d\nApplicant claims he complied with state law in using marijuana and cites to no\ncontradictions with federal law or DoD policy. But his use of marijuana in compliance\nwith his state\u2019s law not only violated DoD policies mandating drug-free federal work\nconditions, but federal law as well. Whether Applicant was ever made aware of federal\nlaw\u2019s preemptive ban of marijuana use in states that authorize its use is unclear.\nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting\nMarijuana Use (Oct. 25, 2014) addresses changes to state laws and the laws of the\nDistrict of Columbia that legalize the use of marijuana. DNI Memorandum ES cautions\nthat an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to th use, sale, or manufacture of\nmarijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\nInstructive, too, on the reach of federal laws and policies to federal employees, and\nimplicitly to federal contractor personnel, who require security clearances, is Executive\nOrder (Exec. Ord) 12564, Drug-Free Federal Workplace (Sept. 15 1986) Noted\nconcerns stress that \u201cthe use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, reflect less than the\ncomplete reliability, stability, and good judgment that is consistent with access to\nsensitive information and creates the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible\naction under pressure that may pose a serious risk to national security, the piblic safety,\nand the effective enforcement of the law.\u201d (Id.)\nWhen the Federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) has been challenged on\nfederalism grounds, the courts have consistently extended federal preemption authority\nover competing state laws that legalize marijuana use. In Oakland Cannabis Buyers,\n532 U.S. 483 (2001), the Supreme Court did not attempt to invalidate the enabling\nlegislation adopted by the particular state in issue. This legislation was designed to\nimplement the key enabling provisions of the state\u2019s Proposition 215, under \u00b6\u00b6 11362.5\net seq. Proposition 215 (known as the Compassionate Use Act) was passed by this\nstate\u2019s voters in 1996 to validate the right of residents of the state to possess and use\nmarijuana for medical purposes, when they have a recommendation from a licensed\n6\n\nphysician. Proposition 215 gives the patient\u2019s primary caregiver the right to cultivate and\npossess marijuana for the patient. But the Supreme Court in Oakland Cannabis Buyers\ndid affirm continued federal jurisdiction over drug violators covered by the federal law\nwithout regard to the state\u2019s marijuana exception.\nMore recently, the Supreme Court seized the opportunity to refine and clarify the\nreach of its holding in Oakland Cannabis Buyers, supra.  In Raich v. Gonzales, 545 U.S.\n1, 8-14 (2005), the Court addressed the claims of two state residents who suffered from\na variety of serious medical conditions and sought to avail themselves of medical\nmarijuana pursuant to the terms of the state\u2019s Compassionate Use Act. Notwithstanding\nthat county investigating officials had found that one respondent\u2019s medical use of\nmarijuana was entirely lawful, federal agents seized and destroyed all six of her\ncannabis plants. In Raich v. Gonzales, supra, the Supreme Court held that the\nregulation of marijuana under the CSA was fully within Congress\u2019 commerce power\n(U.S. Const., art. I, Sec. 8), because marijuana production intended for home production\ncould have a substantial effect on supply and demand in the national market. The Raich\nCourt reasoned that federal failure to regulate the intrastate manufacturing and\npossession of marijuana would leave a considerable gap in the CSA.  In turn, the Court\nvacated the Ninth Circuit\u2019 s judgment. \nSo, even though Applicant was legally within his rights to use marijuana in his\nstate of residence, his recurrent use would not foreclose the Federal Government from\nprosecuting marijuana possession charges under the CSA. It is still unclear whether\nApplicant understands the reach of the CSA in its preemption of his state\u2019s marijuana\nlegalization legislation and how it affects the anti-drug policies placed in force by the\nDoD.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s recurrent abuse of marijuana has never been resumed since\nhis admitted last use in May 2017, his hedging on his potential use of the drug in the\nmakes the likelihood of recurrent use too great to facilitate safe predictions of continued\nabstinence. Considering the record as a whole, at this time there is insufficient probative\nevidence of sustainable mitigation to make predictable judgments about his ability to\navoid marijuana use in the foreseeable future. Taking into account all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s recurrent use of marijuana over a 44-year\nperiod, he does not mitigate security concerns with respect to the allegations covered\nby Guideline H. \nPersonal conduct concerns\nAllegations of illegal drug use covered by Guideline H are incorporated as well\nunder Guideline E. Because Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is adequately covered by\nGuideline H, it does not require separate consideration under he disqualifying conditions\npotentially applicable under Guideline E.  For the same reasons assigned to holding that\nApplicant failed to mitigate drug involvement concerns, conclusions are warranted that\nApplicant does not mitigate raised personal conduct concerns about his illegal use of\nfederally l controlled illegal drugs.\n7\n\nSecurity concerns are raised as well over Applicant\u2019s omission of his past\nmarijuana use in the e-QIP he completed in August 2016. Based on the evidence\nproduced in the record, the falsification allegation covered by Guideline E is\nunsubstantiated. \nWhole-person assessment\nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has established insufficient \nprobative evidence of his overall trustworthiness, and understanding of DoD policy\nconstraints on the use of illegal substances to merit eligibility to hold a security\nclearance or sensitive position. His contributions to the defense industry are worthy of\nrespect and appreciation and are taken into account in making an overall evaluation of\nhis clearance eligibility.  \nAt this time, though, Applicant is at continued risk of recurrence.  Evaluating all of\nthe facts and circumstances developed in the record, Applicant fails to mitigate security\nconcerns associated with the allegations covered by Guidelines H and E pertaining to\nhis illegal use and possession of marijuana. Favorable conclusions are warranted with\nrespect to the allegation pertaining to falsification of Applicant\u2019s 2016 e-QIP.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE H (DRUG INVOLVEMENT):           AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n      \nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):          AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                   Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b: \n                      For Applicant \n           \n          \nConclusion\n        In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                  \nRoger C.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 1, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines D (sexual \nbehavior) and M (use of information technology). Applicant responded to the SOR on \nMay 23, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on July 13, 2018, and \nreassigned to me on July 26, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 16, 2018, scheduling the hearing for August \n16, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called a witness, and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. \nA second witness was unavailable because of an emergency. The case was continued \nuntil October 4, 2018, at which time the witness testified and AE E and F were admitted \n\n \n2 \n \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the first hearing (Tr.1) on August 23, \n2018, and the continued hearing (Tr.2) on October 12, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2018. He has worked in the defense industry since about 2001. He seeks \nto retain a security clearance, which he has held since the early 2000s. He has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in 2001, and a master\u2019s degree, which he \nearned in 2006. He is married with four minor children.1 \n \nApplicant is an admitted sex addict whose addiction is to pornography.2 He \nstarted viewing pornography at a young age. His wife is an ordained minister who \nconsiders pornography and masturbation to be equivalent to infidelity. Applicant\u2019s wife \ndiscovered on several occasions that Applicant was viewing pornography at home. In \norder to avoid his wife finding out that he was continuing to view pornography, Applicant \nviewed pornography at work using his work computer. He also stored pornography on \nthe company\u2019s computer. This was against company policy and went on at various jobs \nfrom about 2002 through September 2017. He never masturbated at his desk, but if \nthere was nobody else in the men\u2019s room, he would sometimes masturbate there.3  \n \nApplicant received marriage and other counseling, and he has been under the \ncare of a licensed professional counselor since 2012. He started attending Sexaholics \nAnonymous (SA), a 12-Step organization based on the Alcoholics Anonymous model, in \nabout 2014.4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2016. He did not report his counseling because he considered it to be \u201cstrictly \nmarital\u201d counseling.5 He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the use of information technology systems \nquestions, including the following:  \n \nIn the last seven (7) years have you introduced, removed, or used \nhardware, software, or media in connection with any information \ntechnology system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by \n                                                          \n1 Tr.1 at 13-14, 34, 45-46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE A, C.  \n \n2 There is a question as to whether \u201caddiction\u201d to pornography is a true addiction in the same sense as \ndrug or alcohol addiction, but it is treated as such by Applicant and Sexaholics Anonymous. See Tr.2 at 9-\n10. \n \n3 Tr.1 at 13-14, 21, 51-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C.  \n \n4 Tr.1 at 21-23, 54-56; Tr.2 at 10; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE C, D.  \n \n5 Tr. at 58-62; GE 1.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations, or attempted any of the \nabove?6 \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in September 2017. \nThe investigator asked him if there was any aspect of his life that could be used against \nhim for blackmail, pressure, or coercion. He told the investigator about his pornography \naddiction and participation in SA. He added that it could not be used to blackmail or \ncoerce him. He stated that his pornography addiction was hurting his wife, and he was \ntrying to stop, but he could not. He admitted that he viewed pornography at work, but he \ntold the investigator that he had not viewed pornography in the previous 18 months. He \nstated the previous 18 months was the longest he went without viewing pornography \nsince he was in the seventh grade. He credited his abstinence to SA and therapy.7 \n \nApplicant informed his employer about his pornography addiction about six days \nafter his background interview. He told his employer that there was a loophole in the \ncompany\u2019s IT system that permitted him to view pornography at work.8 \n \nApplicant contacted the background investigator a week after his first interview. \nHe told the investigator that he had been dishonest when he told the investigator that he \nhad not viewed pornography in 18 months. He stated that the last time he viewed \npornography was at work three days before his first interview. He stated that he \ninformed his employer about his pornography addiction the previous day. He told the \ninvestigator that his goal was to stop viewing pornography altogether, and that he would \nwork towards that goal through counseling and therapy.9 \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer terminated him because of the pornography issues. He was \nhired by another defense contractor in January 2018. He fully informed his current \nemployer of his issues with pornography and why he was terminated from his previous \njob. The employer and Applicant put safeguards in place to deter Applicant from viewing \npornography at work.10 \n \nApplicant has continued to participate in SA and therapy. He testified that he has \nnot viewed pornography at work since before his background interview in September \n2017. He admitted viewing pornography at home about two weeks before the first \nhearing in August 2018. He stated that he immediately informed his group, his SA \nsponsor, and his therapist. He testified that therapy and SA \u201cwill work to keep [him] from \n                                                          \n6 GE 1.  \n \n7 GE 2. The SOR did not allege that Applicant intentionally provided false information to the background \ninvestigator. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It \nmay be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in \nthe whole-person analysis. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2.  \n \n9 GE 2.  \n \n10 Tr.1 at 22-24, 67-70, Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.  \n\n \n4 \n \nrepeating [his] behavior.\u201d He has the complete support of his wife, who has full \nknowledge of his pornography issues.11   \n \nApplicant received an evaluation from a forensic psychologist. The forensic \npsychologist diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and persistent \ndepressive disorder, which \u201cmeans that he functions normally but often feels depressive \nsymptoms and derives less enjoyment from life than most individuals.\u201d12 The forensic \npsychologist concluded: \n \nWith regard to his masturbation in rest rooms at the workplace and \nviewing pornography on workplace computers, [Applicant] recognizes this \nto be a serious problem. Although masturbation in private is considered \nabsolutely normal, using workplace computers to look at pornography is \nnot acceptable. Based on [Applicant\u2019s] understanding of the gravity of this \nbehavior, he committed himself to SA four years ago. He is diligent in his \nattendance at SA meetings. He reports that he has not engaged in \ninappropriate masturbation for the past year. \n \nTo a great degree of psychological certainty, I have concluded that. \n[Applicant] has remediated the problem of viewing pornography and \nmasturbating at the workplace. With that problem remediated, I found no \nother problems that would interfere with [Applicant\u2019s] ability to work in a \nsecure environment. He continues to receive ongoing mental health \ntreatment to assist with his depression, and he receives support through \nhis church activities.13 \n \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance. He is praised for his honesty, trustworthiness, reliability, patriotism, \nresponsibility, moral character, work ethic, dependability, technical expertise, and \nintegrity. He is credited with commendable actions that have greatly benefited his \ncommunity and likely saved some lives. He is recommended for a security clearance.14  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n                                                          \n11 Tr.1 at 12-43, 54-55, 71, 76-77; Tr.2 at 9-10; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C, D.  \n \n12 Tr.1 at 12-43, 54-55, 71; Tr.2 at 6-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE C-F.  \n \n13 AE F.  \n \n14 Tr.1 at 15-21; AE B, C.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant viewed and stored pornography on his company computer from about \n2002 until September 2017. He knew that was against company policy. His behavior \nreflected a severe lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, \nand duress. The above disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n \n \nApplicant used his work computer because he did not want to get caught by his \nwife, an ordained minister who considers pornography and masturbation to be \nequivalent to infidelity. He never masturbated at his desk, but if there was nobody else \nin the men\u2019s room, he would sometimes masturbate there. Although he disclosed his \nconduct during his background interview in September 2017, he also lied and told the \ninvestigator that he had not viewed pornography for 18 months. To his credit, shortly \nthereafter, Applicant informed his employer of his conduct, and he contacted the \ninvestigator and corrected his lie.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer subsequently terminated him. His current employer is fully \naware of his issues with pornography and why he was terminated from his previous job. \nSafeguards are in place to deter Applicant from viewing pornography at work. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he has not viewed pornography at work since before his \nbackground interview in September 2017 is accepted, but with some reservation \nbecause of his previous lie. I also accept most of the forensic psychologist\u2019s opinion, \nwhose conclusions include that \u201c[a]lthough masturbation in private is considered \nabsolutely normal, using workplace computers to look at pornography is not \nacceptable.\u201d Applicant is in his current situation not because he viewed pornography \nand masturbated in the privacy of his home. He is here because he would not or could \nnot stop himself from doing it at work. \n \n \nI find that Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. While nobody ever discovered Applicant viewing \npornography, it cannot be considered strictly private or discreet because it occurred on \nhis work computer. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(d) are not applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(c) and 14(e) \nhave some applicability, but they are insufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s years of \nunacceptable conduct and rules violations. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \n \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n \n \nApplicant knew he was violating company policy when he accessed pornography \non his employers\u2019 computers for about 15 years. The above disqualifying condition is \napplicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \n \nThe above analysis under sexual behavior also applies here. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n41(a) is not applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s strong \ncharacter evidence. \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the sexual behavior and use of information technology security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n07/22/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems, which is ongoing. He has not taken any substantial affirmative action \nto resolve more than $13,000 in delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non March 23, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on March 21, 2018, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 5, 2018. He provided handwritten \nresponses on the SOR and he provided a one-page memorandum in explanation. In \naddition, he provided a more complete answer on April 19, 2018, when he provided a \ntwo-page memorandum in which he addressed each allegation and provided an \nexplanation. His answers to the SOR allegations were mixed, with admissions and \ndenials. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nThe case was assigned to another judge on May 16, 2018, and then reassigned \nto me on May 22, 2018. The hearing took place as scheduled on September 18, 2018. \nApplicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Exhibits 1-7. Applicant did not offer any documentary exhibits, \nhe called no witnesses, and he relied on his own testimony. The hearing transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on September 25, 2018.  \n \nRuling on Procedure \n \n \nThe SOR was amended to correct a minor error concerning Applicant\u2019s name in \nthe case caption, which mistakenly stated he was a senior (Sr.) when he is not. (Tr. 26) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time in the defense industry. He is employed as a custodian for a \ncompany in the defense industry. He has been so employed since July 2016. He was \ninitially hired at an hourly rate of $11.10; he was promoted to manufacturing technician \nat an hourly rate of $15.78 in September 2017; and he was returned to the custodian \nposition at an hourly rate of $14.30 when his interim security clearance was withdrawn \nin connection with issuance of the SOR. His formal education consists of a high school \ndiploma. He has never married, but he has had an on-again, off-again cohabitant since \n1988. (Tr. 27) They share two children who are now young adults in their 20s. \n   \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes a two-year period of unemployment from \nFebruary 2011 to February 2013. In his security clearance application he stated that he \nwas fired from a job as a field technician due to \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d (Exhibit 1) At the \nhearing, he stated that he was fired after testing positive for marijuana, stating that \u201cI got \nlaid off for being dirty on marijuana.\u201d (Tr. 42-44) He received unemployment \ncompensation during that period. (Tr. 44) Otherwise, Applicant has had full-time \nemployment since at least 1992.   \n \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems consisting of 13 delinquent \naccounts ranging from $114 to $7,564 for a total of about $13,291. The accounts \ninclude seven collection accounts, three medical collection accounts, one charged-off \naccount, one unpaid judgment, and one 120-day past-due account. Three of the seven \ncollection accounts are for utility accounts. The two largest debts, for $7,564 and \n\n \n3 \n \n$2,342, stem from rental leases. In addition to his admissions in his answers to the \nSOR, the delinquent debts are established by credit reports from 2017 and 2018. \n(Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7). Applicant did not present any reliable documentation to \nestablish that any of 13 delinquent debts were paid, settled, in a repayment \narrangement, in dispute, forgiven, cancelled, or otherwise resolved. I find that all 13 \ndelinquent accounts in the SOR are unresolved.  \n \nIn addition to the indebtedness in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s financial history includes \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy case that ended in discharge in July 2012. (Exhibit 2) The \nbankruptcy records show that the court granted a discharge for $11,291 in unsecured \nnonpriority claims based on 18 debts, many of which were collection accounts. The \nbankruptcy was a byproduct of Applicant\u2019s job termination and period of unemployment. \n(Tr. 28)  \n \nOverall, Applicant described his current financial situation as \u201ca little bleak.\u201d (Tr. \n45) He has both a checking account and a savings account, but he had negative \nbalances at the time. (Tr. 45-47) He was also incurring overdraft charges, \u201cquite bit \nlately.\u201d (Tr. 47-48) In addition, the most recent credit report from September 2018 listed \ntwo new collections accounts for $456 and $761. (Exhibit 7; Tr. 38-39).   \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s problematic financial history is likely traceable to his two-year-period \nof unemployment during 2011-2013, which is now several years ago, and low-income \njobs. Because he was fired for misconduct, by testing positive for marijuana, the \nresulting period of unemployment was not a circumstance largely beyond his control.  In \naddition, what is missing here is obvious; namely, Applicant failed to take any \nsubstantial affirmative action (\u201ca good-faith effort\u201d) to resolve the 13 delinquent accounts \nfor more than $13,000 in the SOR. Not even the smallest collection account for $114 \nwas paid. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, the evidence is not sufficient to \nmitigate the security concern stemming from his long-standing history of financial \nproblems, which is ongoing and likely to continue. Stated simply, I am not persuaded \nthat Applicant is truly committed to a path of financial responsibility.    \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Applicant married in 1993 and divorced in 2003. He remarried in 2004 and divorced in 2015. He has four children. This is his first application for a security clearance. The SOR alleges Applicant has consumed alcohol to excess to at least November 2017. In May 2017, he was admitted to a hospital for a heart condition, and was treated for five days in an alcohol-detoxification program. In September 2017, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). Applicant admitted the excessive drinking and detox treatment allegations, but denied the DWI arrest because he was not prosecuted. The Government\u2019s documentary evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2017. He stated that in March 2017, he was placed on medical leave from his work to address health issues. He was on bed rest for 60 days, and developed depression. He started consuming alcohol heavily, including up to a fifth of whiskey a day. His spouse urged him to seek treatment after Applicant thought he was having a heart attack. He underwent a five-day inpatient alcohol-detoxification program and was treated for depression. He was prescribed Wellbutrin and Effexor, which he still uses. Applicant returned to work in May 2017.

This \nis his first application for a security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has consumed alcohol to excess to at least November \n2017. In May 2017, he was admitted to a hospital for a heart condition, and was treated \nfor five days in an alcohol-detoxification program. In September 2017, he was arrested \nfor driving while intoxicated (DWI). Applicant admitted the excessive drinking and detox \ntreatment allegations, but denied the DWI arrest because he was not prosecuted. The \nGovernment\u2019s documentary evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2017. He stated \nthat in March 2017, he was placed on medical leave from his work to address health \nissues. He was on bed rest for 60 days, and developed depression. He started consuming \nalcohol heavily, including up to a fifth of whiskey a day. His spouse urged him to seek \ntreatment after Applicant thought he was having a heart attack. He underwent a five-day \ninpatient alcohol-detoxification program and was treated for depression. He was \nprescribed Wellbutrin and Effexor, which he still uses. Applicant returned to work in May \n2017. At that time, he described his current use of alcohol as \u201cminimal,\u201d to include one-\nto-two shots of whiskey a month. \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant was arrested for DWI. He began drinking at home \nwhere he consumed about four to five shots of vodka over one to two hours. When he \nran out, he drove to a store for another pint of vodka. Applicant was stopped by police for \na traffic violation, was arrested, and held overnight. Applicant immediately referred \nhimself to a 24-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. The prosecutor did not pursue \nthe DWI charge.  \n \nApplicant was re-interviewed by a Government investigator in November 2017, \nwhere he disclosed his DWI and alcohol-detoxification treatment. He also disclosed that \nhe enjoys drinking alcohol, and now consumes one to two pints of vodka per week, which \nis less than the pint every one-two days that he previously consumed. He stated that he \nis decreasing his alcohol use, and is continuing his counseling and the medications for \ndepression. He admitted using poor judgment when he drove after consuming alcohol, \nand stated he will not do so in the future. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSince Applicant elected a decision without a hearing, I was unable to inquire further \ninto his alcohol use, treatment, alcohol-related arrest, medical evaluations, prognosis, and \nany changes in lifestyle. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) in a Security Executive Agent Directive, effective on June 8, 2017. These AGs are \napplicable to this decision. \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \n\n \n4 \n \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related \nincidents that led to a five-day detoxification and DWI arrest while his security clearance \neligibility was pending. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history, as detailed in the findings of fact, indicates a pattern of \nexcessive use of alcohol, before and after treatment. Applicant\u2019s has attended two \ninpatient alcohol-treatment programs, but has not submitted any medical evaluations, \ndiagnosis, or prognosis to favor application of mitigating conditions. Despite attending an \nalcohol-detoxification treatment program in March 2017, after applying for a security \nclearance, he continued to drink to excess. He was interviewed by a Government \ninvestigator in June 2017, and was arrested for DWI in September 2017. He again \nattended alcohol counseling and continues to consume alcohol.  \n \n The record is devoid of substantial evidence of a change in behavior, and efforts \nto ensure that no further alcohol related incidents will occur. I am not convinced that \nApplicant has his alcohol consumption under control, and that further alcohol-related \nincidents are unlikely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and Applicant \nhas not proffered sufficient evidence of rehabilitation and a change in lifestyle to \novercome concerns about his established pattern of excessive alcohol use. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \n\n \n6 \n \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s history of \nalcohol-related incidents and failure to show credible rehabilitation and a changed lifestyle \nremain an ongoing concern. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Aileen B. Xenakis, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and testimony, I conclude that \nApplicant mitigated security concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 2, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance for her employment as \na logistics specialist for a defense contractor. The Department of Defense (DOD) could \nnot make the affirmative findings required to continue a security clearance. On April 4, \n2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns for foreign influence under Guideline B. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n02/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 1, 2018, admitting the six allegations of \nforeign influence under Guideline B. The allegations detailed concerns about her family \nmembers who are citizens and residents of South Korea. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on June 23, 2018, and I was assigned the case on September 10, \n2018. DOD issued Applicant a notice of hearing on September 12, 2018, for a hearing \non November 8, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government\u2019s three \nexhibits (GE 1, 2, and 3) were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified and her five exhibits (AE A through E) were admitted into the record without \nobjection. I received the transcript of the hearing on November 26, 2018.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant requested that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts concerning South Korea, and both provided relevant documents. (GE 3; \nAE D and E) I will take administrative notice of facts concerning South Korea as noted \nin my Findings of Fact.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant was born in South Korea in March 1959 and is 59 years old. She married a \nmember of the United States military stationed in South Korea in August 1977. She \nentered the United States with her then husband in June 1978 at age 18, and became a \nUnited States citizen in April 1984. She and her husband divorced in November 1987. \nApplicant has not seen him since they divorced. They had no children.  \n \n \nApplicant served for 22 years on active duty in the United States Army from \nJanuary 1981 until January 2003, retiring as a sergeant first class (E-7) with an \nhonorable discharge. She served in various administrative and logistics positions while \non active duty. She attended various colleges while on active duty and received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in March 2012.  \n \n \nApplicant was employed as a DOD civil servant in various administrative and \nlogistics positions in the United States and South Korea from January 2003 until retiring \nfrom the civil service in December 2015. She has been employed since then by a \ndefense contractor in South Korea as a senior logistics specialist. She has always \nreceived top ratings while on active duty, as a civil servant, and as a contractor. She \nreceived recognition and spot awards as a contractor. She has held a security \nclearance since entering active duty, and her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation has never been challenged in the 37 years she has held a security \nclearance. (Tr. 19-29, 40-42; GX 1, e-QIP, dated March 2, 2016) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits that her brother (SOR 1.a), two half-\nbrothers (SOR 1.b), a sister (SOR 1.c), and a half-sister (SOR 1.d) are citizens and \nresidents of South Korea. She also admits that she has two nephews who are a citizens \nand residents of South Korea, one currently serving in the South Korean Air Force \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(SOR 1.e), and the other currently serving in the South Korean Army Reserve (SOR \n1.f). \n \n \nApplicant has spent half of her lifetime living and working on U.S. military bases. \nEven though Applicant is now stationed in South Korea, she remains close to the U.S. \nmilitary and her life is centered on the U.S. military base. She participates in on-base \nprograms, such as the library, banking, special holiday programs, and chapel services. \nWhile stationed in South Korea, she has returned each year to the United States to visit \nfamily and friends, and to sightsee. She plans to retire in the United States. She and her \nsister have purchased a house in the United States that they are remodeling to use in \nretirement. She has a 401(k) retirement plan and a thrift savings plan, as well as stocks \nand bonds invested with U.S. based companies. She will receive a pension from the \nU.S. military for both military and civilian service, she is receiving disability from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), and she is eligible for Social Security. All of her \nfunds and bank accounts are in U.S. banks or credit unions. She does not receive any \nbenefits from South Korea. She is current with all of her U.S. taxes. Her ultimate plan is \nto be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. She considers the United States to be her \nhome. (Tr. 22-32) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother (SOR 1.a) is 62 years old, a citizen and resident of South \nKorea, and employed as an airport bus driver. He is married. Since he lives about two \nhours from Applicant, she does not visit him often. She does not provide him financial \nsupport. He has never asked her about her military work, or asked her to provide him \nwith military information. (Tr. 32-33) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two half-brothers (SOR 1.b) are citizens and residents of South \nKorea, in their late 70s to early 80s, and retired. She sees them rarely, and last saw \nthem a few years ago when her mother was in the hospital and they came to visit. When \nApplicant retired from the military and left Korea in 2015, they brought their families to \nher farewell party. (Tr. 33-34)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister (SOR 1.c) is a citizen and resident of South Korea, in her mid-\n60s, and a caregiver for the elderly. She lives about two and a half hours away from \nApplicant, so Applicant does not see her often. Their contact is mainly by phone. Her \nsister has been to the United States because her son is on active duty in the United \nStates Army. Her nephew brought her sister and her brother-in-law to the United States \nto live. Even though they had permanent resident status in the United States, they \nreturned to South Korea because of illness and language problems. (Tr. 34-36) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s half-sister (SOR 1.d) is a citizen and resident of South Korea, and in \nher 70s. She lives in the countryside, so Applicant communicates with her only \noccasionally by phone. Applicant\u2019s half-sister has no affiliation with the South Korean \ngovernment. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s nephew is a citizen and resident of South Korea, in his late 30s, and \non active duty in the Korean Air Force (SOR 1.e). Applicant saw him once or twice when \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhe was a child. Since she returned to Korea, she has only seen him at her sister\u2019s \nhouse a few times when he came to celebrate Korean holidays. (Tr.36-37)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other nephew (SOR 1.d) is a citizen and resident of South Korea, and \nin his late 30s. He served his mandatory military duty in the South Korean Army but still \nremains a member of the Korean Army Reserve. His civilian occupation is as an English \nteacher in a language institute. (Tr. 37-38) \n \n \nApplicant has immediate family members who are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. She stays with one sister when she visits the United States. Applicant \nalso has a sister who is married to an U.S. Air Force retiree, and two nephews who are \non active duty in the United States Army. (Tr. 38-40) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts concerning South Korean that are \ncommon knowledge and not subject to dispute. South Korea is a stable, democratic \nrepublic. The United States and South Korea have been close allies since 1950, and \nhave fought communism on the Korean peninsula and in Vietnam. The United States, \nsince 1950 and currently, has thousands of U.S. military personnel stationed in South \nKorea, and frequently conducts joint military operation with and in South Korea. About \n2.3 million Koreans live in the United States. The United States has promised over the \nnext few years to provide about $11 billion in force enhancements to Korea. South \nKorea is the United States\u2019 seventh largest trading partner. The recently signed free \ntrade agreement between the United States and South Korea will generate billions of \ndollars in additional economic growth and job creation in both countries.  \n \n \nThe South Korean government generally respects the human rights of its \ncitizens. South Korea. South Korea does not recognize dual citizenship. There have \nbeen circumstances were U.S. citizens with connections to South Korea were drafted \ninto the South Korean Army. \n \n \nIn recent years, the United States and South Korea have differed in their \ndiplomatic approaches towards North Korea. The United States position is more \nassertive and it attempts to curtail North Korea\u2019s development of advanced military \ntechnology, such as ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. There has been progress in \nthis area, and North Korea has curtailed its missile tests. The North Korean dictator and \nthe President of the United States have met to discuss diplomatic solutions and plan to \nmeet again. South Korea has emphasized steps towards unification of North and South \nKorea. Limited visits of relatives across the demilitarized zone have recently been \npermitted by both North and South Korea.  \n \n \nIndustrial espionage includes seeking commercial secrets. South Korea has a \nhistory of collecting protected U.S. information. In 2000, South Korea was listed as one \nof the seven most active countries engaged in foreign economic collection and industrial \nespionage against the United States. In 1997, a U.S. defense contractor was fined for \nunlicensed exports to South Korea. The same year, a civilian employee of the U.S. \nNavy passed classified documents to the South Korean naval attach\u00e9 to the United \n\n \n5 \n \n \nStates. On multiple occasions, South Korea has been the unauthorized recipient of \nsensitive technology, in violation of U.S. export control laws.  (GX 3, Request for \nAdministrative Notice; AX F, Request for Administrative Notice; AX E, Supporting \nDocuments for Administrative Notice) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, financial, \nand property interests, are a national security concern if they result in divided \nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in \nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterests is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associate \nwith a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6)  \n \n \nApplicant has immediate family members, a brother, two half-brothers, a sister, a \nhalf-sister, and two nephews who are citizens and residents of South Korea. Even \nthough Appellant is stationed in South Korea, her contact with her family members is \nmostly by phone calls and occasional visits.  \n \n \nWhile South Korea is a stable democracy with extremely close ties to the United \nStates, there is economic espionage targeted at the United States and danger because \nof the proximity to North Korea. These circumstances create a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. In spite of her limited \ncontact with her family members in South Korea, these family members are a security \nconcern raising the following Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information. \n \n \nThe mere existence of foreign relationships and contacts is not sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. The nature of Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships \nmust be examined to determine whether it creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative \nterm denoting increased risk compared to some normally existing risk that can be \ninherent anytime there are foreign contacts and relationships. The totality of an \napplicant\u2019s ties to a foreign country as well as to each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. The foreign influence security concern is not limited to countries hostile to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe United States. The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States. Even friendly nations can \nhave profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as \nimportant to their vital interests or national security. Friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the U. S., especially in economic, scientific, and technical fields. The \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human \nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant is at risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant has contact with family members who are residents and citizens of \nSouth Korea. There is economic espionage targeted at the United States and the \ncountry is in close proximity to North Korea. These factors place a heightened risk of \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion on Applicant.  \n \n \nI considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for or \nobligation to immediate family members. Applicant has contact with her family members \nin South Korea by telephone and visits. She attends family holiday celebrations and \nvisits and calls her family members. These facts establish a close and continuing \nrelationship between Applicant and her family members in South Korea. Her level of \ncontact is not casual or infrequent, and indicates that Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the \nfamily members is significant. It should be noted that her two nephews who are \nresidents and citizens of South Korea are members of the South Korean military. As \nsuch, they work and serve alongside members of the United States military. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties and sense of loyalty to the U. S. are extensive. She has been a \nUnited States citizen for over 34 years. She served in the United States Army for over \n22 years, worked as a civilian employee of the United States military for more than 13 \nyear, and has been a defense contractor serving the U.S. military for over four years. \nShe has been eligible for access to classified information for over 37 years with no \nblemishes on her security record. She lives a decidedly American lifestyle within the \nU.S. military. She has immediate family members who are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States, and some serving on active duty in the United States military. She plans \nto return to the United States in retirement and to be interred in Arlington National \nCemetery. All of her funds, including retirement accounts and stocks, are in U.S. banks. \nWhile stationed overseas, she has participated in the United States military community \nprograms rather than Korean activities. She depends on the U.S. military for her \nsupport.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members in South Korea can place her in a position to have to \nchoose between the interests of the family members and the interests of the United \nStates. Even though her family members in South Korea are ordinary citizens, the \nsituation in South Korea can make them vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or \ninducement to request Applicant to provide them protected information. However, her \nconnection to and loyalty to the United States is so deep and longstanding that she can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U. S. interests. Accordingly, \nApplicant has met her heavy burden to show that her relationships with her family \nmembers in South Korea are not a security concern. I conclude Appellant has mitigated \nsecurity concerns for foreign influence.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The whole-person concept requires \nconsideration of all available information about Applicant to reach a determination \nconcerning Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. I considered that \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Army for 22 years, worked as a \ncivilian employee for the United States military for over 13 years, and has worked and is \nworking as a civilian employee of a defense contractor for over four years. She has \nbeen eligible for access to classified information of over 37 years with no reported \nsecurity issues.  \n \nThe presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in South Korea creates a \nheightened risk of foreign influence leading to the potential for vulnerability, pressure, or \ncoercion on Applicant. However, Applicant has shown her overwhelming connections \nand ties to the United States by her many years of service to the U.S. military. Even \nwhile overseas, she has fostered a connection to the U.S. military community. She has \nalmost as many immediate family members that are citizens and residents of the United \nStates as she has that are citizens and residents of South Korea. In fact, she \nestablished that her connection to her relatives in the United States are closer than her \nconnection to her relatives in South Korea. Applicant\u2019s long years of service increase \nthe probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign \npower, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit her. The many years of \nhonorable service weighs heavily towards approval of her security clearance.  \n \nThese facts leave me without questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for access to classified information. The protection of the national security \nis the paramount consideration. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated foreign influence concerns based on her family members in South Korea. \nAccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

He also has ongoing federal income tax debt. He \ndid not mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 6, 2016. \nOn June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. DOD CAF took this action under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \neffective June 8, 2017.  \n03/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 9, 2018, and requested a hearing.1 The \ncase was assigned to me on November 13, 2018. On November 21, 2018, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the \nhearing for December 13, 2018, a date agreed to by the parties.  \n \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was admitted without \nobjection. I held the record open until December 31, 2018, to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documentation. On December 31, 2018, Applicant \nsubmitted four documents, which are marked as AE B through AE E, and admitted \nwithout objection.2 Applicant also requested additional time to get documents from the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS). At the time, the IRS was significantly affected by the \n35-day federal government shutdown. As a result, I held the record open until January \n31, 2019. (HE III) \n \nOn January 31, 2019, Applicant indicated by e-mail that he had submitted \nadditional materials to DOHA, and \u201cstill [had] not received the transcript.\u201d I wrote back \non February 7, 2019, and asked him to clarify his statement. (HE III) Applicant did not \nrespond. No additional materials were received. I therefore closed the record on \nFebruary 7, 2019. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 4, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e \u2013 1.i, and 1.k. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.j, and 1.l. For most allegations, he included a brief explanation. His admissions \nand explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He was married from 2000 to 2009. He has one adult \nson. Applicant has a high school diploma and some community college credits. He \nserved in the United States Navy from 1980 to 2000, retiring as a chief petty officer (E-\n7). He has worked in the defense industry ever since, either for his current employer, or \nits predecessor. He has had a security clearance for 18 years. (Tr. 12, 26-30, 57; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR first alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns, as required, for tax years 2011 to 2016. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) The \n                                                          \n1 Applicant initially did not specifically \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.j. He did so in a September 14, \n2018 e-mail to DOD CAF that is included in his Answer.  \n \n2 In post-hearing correspondence, I referred to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits as AE A through D. \n(Hearing Exhibit III) Since his hearing exhibit is already marked as AE A, I have re-marked his post-\nhearing exhibits sequentially, starting with AE B. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nremaining allegations concern past-due federal and state income taxes. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 \n1.l) \n \n \nOn his January 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed unfiled state and federal income \ntax returns for 2014 and 2015 and some tax debt. (GE 1 at 31-37) He discussed his tax \nsituation in personal subject interviews conducted in February 2017, September 2017, \nand December 2017. (GE 2) \n \n \nApplicant prepared and mailed his state and federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011 to 2016 in May 2018, while preparing GE 2, his interrogatory response. (Tr. \n33-38, 53-56) When he signed GE 2, in June 2018, he indicated that his returns \nremained unfiled, but clarified at hearing that though he had mailed the returns, he did \nnot consider them \u201cfiled\u201d until he had received confirmation of receipt from the IRS and \nthe state tax authority. (Tr. 38-42)  \n \n \nApplicant also stated that he owed about $24,278 combined in past-due federal \nincome taxes for 2011-2016, with specific amounts detailed for each year. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \n\u2013 1.i; 1.k) He explained at hearing that he calculated those figures based on the returns \nthat he prepared at that time. (Tr. 53) He stated that he had requested a payment plan \nwith the IRS. He stated that he owed $500 in past-due state income taxes for those \nyears. (SOR \u00b6 1.l) He did not provide documentation from the IRS or the state tax \nauthority, though he was requested to do so. (GE 2) He said this was because he did \nnot keep copies of the returns, which is also why he was not able to provide them at his \nhearing. (Tr. 40) \n \n \nApplicant has lived in the same house since 2010. (Tr. 28-30; GE 1) The home \nhe shared with his wife was foreclosed in 2009, after she stopped paying the mortgage, \nhe said. He disclosed the foreclosure on his SCA. (GE 1) It is not alleged in the SOR, \nand is not reflected on credit reports in the record. (Tr. 28-30) Applicant and his former \nwife remain on good terms. For a time, he paid her rent ($600 a month) but stopped \ndoing that to have more money to pay his back taxes. Applicant\u2019s former wife now lives \nwith him. (Tr. 32) \n \n \nApplicant explained that his tax debts and filing problems arose from two \ncircumstances, both arising after his 2009 divorce. First, he stated that for several \nyears, he had not received his IRS form W-2 related to his Navy pension, from the \nDefense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS). He acknowledged at hearing that, though \nhe received W-2\u2019s regularly from his employer, he never reported to DFAS that he had \nmoved in 2010, which could explain why he did not receive his Navy W-2s. (Tr. 30-31; \nGE 1; GE 2) Since he did not have his Navy W-2s, he did not file his tax returns, and \nchose instead to wait passively until he received them. This went on for several years, \nthrough tax years 2011 to 2016. Applicant testified he procrastinated and that \u201cit slipped \nmy mind.\u201d Applicant did not rectify his issues with DFAS until he prepared his \ninterrogatory response. (Tr. 30-31, 36)  \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSecond, Applicant also acknowledged at hearing that, although he had been \ndivorced from his wife since 2009, he never changed his tax filing status to reflect that \nhe was no longer married. As a result, he incurred significant federal income tax debt, \nsince his taxes were being calculated on the basis of exemptions to which he was no \nlonger entitled. (Tr. 44-45)  \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.j, a 2015 wage garnishment by the IRS for $7,115, \nand said he did not recall it. (Tr. 52) However, he also disclosed that garnishment on his \nSCA, with the exact dollar amount. (GE 1 at 34) Applicant also denied SOR \u00b6 1.c, a \n$3,856 state tax lien issued in 2010. Both debts are on GE 5, an incident report relating \nto Applicant from DOD\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS). (GE 5; Tr. 45-46) \nThe tax lien at \u00b6 1.c is no longer reflected on more recent credit reports. (GE 3, 4) \n \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.d, a $21,279 federal tax lien, also issued in 2010. (GE \n5) He testified that when he learned of the lien, he went to the bank and paid it off with a \ncheck, in full. (Tr. 48-52, 55) He provided proof of the payment after the hearing. (AE C) \n \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.l, the $500 state tax debt from tax years 2011-2016. \nHe paid the debt in April 2018. (AE B; Tr. 56) Applicant also stated that he does not \nknow if he owes any additional state taxes because he was told that those returns are \n\u201cin processing\u201d with state tax authorities. They told him there are no outstanding state \nliens. (Tr. 33-34) He provided no state income tax returns, and no documents from state \ntax authorities about the status of his returns and state tax debt, even after the hearing.  \n \n \nApplicant said he had a tax advisor when he owned his marital home and paid a \nmortgage, but has not otherwise had a tax counselor or pursued credit counseling. He \nhas not sought tax advice available to him through the military. (Tr. 69-74) \n \nAE A is Applicant\u2019s payment agreement with the IRS, dated July 3, 2018. It \nreferences tax years 2016 (alleged) and 2017 (not alleged).3 Applicant is to pay $600 a \nmonth for six years (a total of about $43,000), through automatic withdrawals from his \nchecking account. His first payment was on August 10, 2018. (AE A; AE D; Tr. 42-43, \n67-69) No other tax payments are documented.  \n \n \nAE A does not reference any other tax years. There are no other documents from \nthe IRS in the record. Applicant\u2019s tax returns from 2011-2016 are also not in evidence. \nThus, there is no documentation of what Applicant currently owes in past-due federal \ntaxes, penalties and interest.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor attested that Applicant is responsible and trustworthy. He \nhas integrity. He is reliable, efficient, and has an excellent work ethic. He works well \n                                                          \n3 Applicant testified that he filed his 2017 state and federal income tax returns on time, and paid what he \nowed. (Tr. 31, 54) The reference in AE A to the 2017 tax year suggests that Applicant may owe past-due \ntaxes for that year. However, there are no additional details in the record on that point, so I do not make \nthat inference. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwith others, and is an easy-going and well-liked team member. He is a \u201cphenomenal \nemployee.\u201d (AE E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d4 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n                                                          \n4 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax filing issues occurred after his divorce, when he failed to advise \nDFAS of his move, so he stopped receiving his W-2s. As a result, he decided not to file \nseveral years\u2019 worth of state and federal income tax returns (2011-2016). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b). Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax debt from those years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \u2013 1.j, \n1.l) resulted from his failure to adjust his exemptions after his divorce to reflect that he \nwas no longer married. Both circumstances were preventable, and implicate AG \u00b6 19(b), \ngiven Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to act responsibly. SOR \u00b6 1.j, a 2015 wage garnishment \nby the IRS, is also established. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a), (c), and (f) also apply. \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961).5   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d concern two tax liens issued against Applicant, by the state \nand the IRS, respectively, in 2010. Applicant denied both, stating he did not recognize \none and he paid the other. Both are referenced in a JPAS incident report (GE 5), and \nare therefore established, since they existed at one point. The 2010 federal tax lien was \nresolved in 2011, when Applicant paid it in full with a check. The 2010 state tax lien was \nlikely also resolved around then as well, though this is undocumented. Both liens \npredate the 2011 tax year, the first year Applicant failed to timely file his returns, and the \norigin of those tax debts is unclear. The above AGs also apply to those allegations. \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to perform simple due diligence after he divorced by updating his \naddress and his tax exemptions. Rather than investigate the matter when he did not \nreceive his Navy W-2s, he did nothing, and chose instead not to file his state and \nfederal income tax returns for several years. These circumstances were of Applicant\u2019s \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nown making, and he failed to act responsibly in addressing them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply.  \n \n \nEven before Applicant\u2019s tax filing issues, he had significant tax debt, as shown by \nthe two liens issued in 2010. SOR \u00b6 1.d was paid and resolved in 2011. There is no \nrecord evidence to establish that SOR \u00b6 1.c, the state tax lien, has been resolved. \nExactly how much Applicant currently owes in past-due federal tax debt remains \nunknown, as there are no state or federal tax returns in the record. However, Applicant \nacknowledged that he has enough ongoing federal tax debt to warrant a six-year \npayment plan at $600 a month, meaning he likely owes about $43,000. Applicant paid \nthe $500 he owed in state taxes from 2011 to 2016, so SOR \u00b6 1.l is resolved. No other \nstate tax debt is evident.  \n \n \nApplicant has not established good-faith compliance with his tax requirements to \nshow that his prior tax issues are unlikely to recur or no longer cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness and judgment. Significant federal tax debt remains ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has not sought credit counseling or tax \nassistance. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \nAfter years of being irresponsible and inattentive, Applicant was finally energized \nto address his overdue tax returns and tax debt when he received the Government\u2019s \nInterrogatories. The fact that he acted only when his clearance was imperiled raises \nquestions about his willingness to follow the sometimes complex rules governing \nclassified information when his personal interests are not at stake.6 Even if Applicant \nhad documented that he filed all his returns in May 2018, I cannot simply adopt a \nposition of \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d or \u201call\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d7 AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant provided no documented evidence of any tax returns, and showed \nevidence of one payment towards his federal tax repayment plan. The mere fact that \nApplicant made belated arrangements with appropriate tax authorities to file his returns \nis insufficient to apply AG \u00b6 20(g).  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n                                                          \n6 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016). \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has spent his entire adult life \nin honorable service to his country, first in the Navy for 20 years, and then for many \nyears since then, in the defense industry. However, he has also spent his entire adult \nlife making his living from the federal tax dollar. That background provides both \nmitigating and exacerbating evidence when considering his long and ongoing record of \ntax problems. Applicant\u2019s tax issues are also entirely self-created, and were resolvable \nwith simple due diligence after his divorce. Applicant\u2019s demonstrated pattern of \nunwillingness to comply with his legal obligations until his eligibility for a security \nclearance was at stake raises serious security concerns. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Applicant did not mitigate financial security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \ncontinued access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \nDecision \nGregg A. Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 27, 2017. On \nMarch 14, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline H.1\nApplicant answered the SOR on June 8, 2018, and elected to have the case decided \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief with \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017.\n01/15/2019\n\n2 \n \nsupporting documents, known as the File of Relevant Material (FORM), was submitted by \nDepartment Counsel on July 13, 2018. A complete copy of the FORM was provided to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on July 31, \n2018, but did not submit a response within the time provided. The Government\u2019s exhibits \nincluded in the FORM (Items 1 through 5) are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on January 9, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old computer programmer for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 2017. He was fired from a previous position in 2016 due to \u201cdrug issues,\u201d although \nApplicant denied using drugs while with that employer, and denied that he departed for \nthat reason. He received a general education degree (GED) in lieu of a high school \ndiploma. He is unmarried, but has lived with his fianc\u00e9e since 2012. He has never held a \nDOD security clearance. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from October 2001 to at least February 2017. The SOR also alleged an arrest in \n2002 for possession of marijuana and driving under the influence of drugs; a 2003 arrest \nfor possession of narcotic equipment and possession of marijuana with intent to sell; a 2007 \narrest for unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and possession of one ounce of \nmarijuana; a 2015 arrest for interference with the arresting officer, use or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and possession of a controlled substance (marijuana/spice); and a \n2017 arrest for speeding, possession of controlled substance (marijuana/spice) and two \ncounts of use or possession of drug paraphernalia.  \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations, but denied using marijuana after about October \n2015. He noted some charges from the 2003 arrest were dismissed, and all of the charges \nfrom the 2015 and 2017 arrests were dismissed. Applicant provided a document from the \nrelevant court with his Answer to the SOR, showing that he entered guilty pleas to the 2017 \ncharges of possession of controlled substance, and use or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \n \nApplicant discussed his history of marijuana purchases, possession, and use during \nhis personal subject interview (PSI) by a Government investigator. He stated that he began \nexperimenting with marijuana in about 2001, and continued to purchase and use it about \n150 times between 2001 and 2015. He noted that while using marijuana, it would affect his \nability to hold confidences and that it caused him to often call in sick to work. He has never \nreceived drug treatment and his fianc\u00e9e is aware of his drug-use history. \n \nIn 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of marijuana, which \nwas dismissed while the driving under the influence of drugs charge resulted in a conviction. \nHe was unable to recall the circumstances because of the time elapsed since the incident. \nIn 2003, Applicant\u2019s car was searched incident to a traffic stop after the officer smelled \nmarijuana. Applicant and the driver were arrested for possession of marijuana with intent \nto sell and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was convicted and sentenced to serve \n\n3 \n \n365 days in jail (all but 60 days suspended), fined, and three years\u2019 probation. \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was charged with possession of drug paraphernalia and unlawful \ndistribution of a controlled substance. He was convicted of possession of marijuana and \nunlawful distribution. He was sentenced to 180 days confinement and fined. In 2015, \nApplicant was again involved in a traffic stop when the officer searched his vehicle and \nfound marijuana. Applicant claimed it was for his personal use. The charges of obstruction \nof justice and possession of marijuana were dismissed because the officer failed to obtain \na search warrant. In 2017, an officer smelled marijuana incident to a traffic stop, and \ndiscovered marijuana in a backpack in Applicant\u2019s car. Applicant claimed that someone, \nwhom he refused to name, used his car and left the backpack in it. Despite his claim, \nApplicant pleaded guilty to charges of possession of a controlled substance and use or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; however, the plea was held in abeyance for six months \nand dismissed if Applicant refrained from similar offenses and paid a fine. Applicant asked \nthe court to terminate his \u201cplea in abeyance\u201d early because of his pending security \nclearance investigation. \n \nApplicant noted that his career, fianc\u00e9e, and intent to start a family were more \nimportant than using marijuana. He thought the medical aspects of marijuana would help \nhim with anxiety, but it had the opposite effect of making him paranoid and more anxious. \nSince Applicant elected to have this case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing, \nI was unable to further inquire into these allegations or evaluate his demeanor or credibility \nin response to questions. He did not submit documentary evidence of drug abuse \ncounseling, changes in lifestyle, or a signed statement of intent to abstain from further drug \ninvolvement. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) in a Security Executive Agent Directive, effective on June 8, 2017. These AGs are \napplicable to this decision. \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \u201ccontrol \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access \nto classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n\n4 \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from being \neligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or rational \nconnection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an \napplicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, \n2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they \nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in  \nAG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n\n5 \n \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 25. \nThe disqualifying condition potentially applicable in this case includes: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \nApplicant has a long history of illegal drug purchase, use, and possession, including \nintent to sell, particularly from 2001 to 2017. Although he claims to have stopped using \nmarijuana in 2015, his 2017 guilty plea for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia \nshows continued illegal drug involvement and casts doubt on the veracity of his claims of \nrecent abstinence. The record is devoid of a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue \nmarijuana use and illegal drug involvement. Disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 (a), (c), \nand (g) are applicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n\n6 \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He began \u201cexperimenting\u201d with marijuana in 2001, and \ncontinued use for at least 14 to 16 years. By his own estimate, he used marijuana about \n150 times. His claim to have refrained from drug use since 2015 is not supported by credible \nevidence and is unconvincing given his 2017 guilty pleas for possession of marijuana and \ndrug paraphernalia. He has not shown a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue \nfurther drug use or illegal drug involvement, or to change the environment where illegal \ndrugs are being used or disassociation from drug-using associates. He has not attended a \ndrug treatment program or submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. Applicant\u2019s stated history of drug use, and recurring \narrests for drug-related crimes raises questions about his truthfulness, reliability, and ability \nto follow rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s failure to show rehabilitation and a change in \nbehavior toward drug involvement continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. No mitigation is warranted. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion may \nnot be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be found \nineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable \njudgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact and \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is a mature adult \nwhose history of recurring illegal drug involvement leaves me with serious questions about \nhis future intent and his willingness to follow rules and regulations. I am not convinced that \nhe fully appreciates the legal and policy implications of his actions, and he has not clearly \nand convincingly established a commitment to discontinue further illegal drug use. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  Subparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \n \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",
