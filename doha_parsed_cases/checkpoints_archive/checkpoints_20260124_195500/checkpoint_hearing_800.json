Eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline I \n(Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. She provided eleven documents, labeled as Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A-K. She denied and admitted, in part, SOR allegation \u00b6 1.a, and she admitted SOR \nallegation \u00b6 1.b. On December 31, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of Hearing, setting the hearing for January 15, 2019. On January \n3, 2019, the case was assigned to me.  \n03/26/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibit (GE) 1 \nthrough 5, and they were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel \noffered AE A through P, which I entered into evidence without objection. I held the record \nopen until February 15, 2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional \ndocumentation. On January 28, 2019, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted AE Q, which I \nentered into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 25, 2019, and the record was closed on February 15, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. She earned a master\u2019s degree in communication arts in \n2001. She married her spouse in 2011. She has a 12-year-old stepdaughter, who \ncurrently lives with Applicant and her spouse. Since May 2016, she has been employed \nfull time for a defense contractor as a contract technical writer.1  \n \nPsychological Conditions \n \n \nThe SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnosis in approximately 2005 of delusional disorder \u2013 chronic, paranoid type. In May \n2018, she was diagnosed with delusional disorder chronic - paranoid type; major \ndepressive disorder, severe, in partial remission; and unspecified anxiety disorder. Her \nprognosis was listed as poor. \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant was advised by her general practitioner to see a psychiatrist. \nShe had been diagnosed in 2002 with two sexually transmitted diseases (STD), which \ncaused her severe anxiety. She had thoughts about dying of cancer, feelings of \ndepression, and her condition caused her to excessively pick at her skin. She also \nbelieved people were talking negatively about her. She began seeing a psychiatrist in \n2004, who referred her to a psychologist in 2005. Applicant claimed she was diagnosed \nwith anxiety and depression only, and denied being aware of the delusional disorder \ndiagnosis. She claimed she learned that she had been diagnosed with that condition after \nshe received the SOR in September 2018. Applicant was prescribed an anti-depressant, \nan anti-seizure medication for her fear of flight, and an anti-psychotic drug. She believed \nthe medications prescribed were to treat her anxiety and depression. She stopped seeing \nthe psychologist in 2006, but continued her appointments with the psychiatrist.2  \n \n \nBeginning in 2007, Applicant started to wean herself from her prescribed \nmedications without consulting or notifying her psychiatrist. She claimed she had asked \nher psychiatrist why she was taking an anti-psychotic drug, but he stated he could not \nremember. She asked him how long she would continue taking all of the prescribed \nmedications, and his reply was that she would most likely remain on the medication for \nthe rest of her life. Applicant believed the medication caused her to feel obsessive, sad, \nand added stress. She began to taper off from her medications over a period of time.  She \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 17-18. \n \n2 Tr. 21-23, 26, 40, 52-56; GE 3, GE 5; AE Q. \n\n \n3 \n \nalso attributed her weight gain - almost 100 pounds, to the medication. In September \n2008, Applicant informed her psychiatrist that she had completely weaned herself from \nthe prescribed medications. She also let him know that she would not continue further \ntreatment with him.3  \n \n \n \nSince September 2008, Applicant has not treated with any other mental health \npractitioner, nor has she taken any prescribed medication for her mental health \nconditions. She attended a one-day self-help seminar in 2007. It was a 12-step program \nentitled Self Abuse Finally Ends (SAFE). Applicant was attending church at the time, and \nshe correlated Bible stories with the information she learned from the SAFE seminar. She \nasked her minister if she could start a 12-week group at the church to connect with people \nwho had similar issues. Beginning in 2008, she led five 12-week self-help sessions. One \nor two other people attended the support sessions. The sessions ended in approximately \n2009. Applicant attended a Christian-based recovery program through a different church. \nWithin six months, another minister asked her to lead the group. This support group ended \nin 2011. Applicant feels that her life is good, she is supported by her husband, and she \nclaims that she no longer suffers from any mental health-related issues.4 \n \n \nApplicant applied for a DOD security clearance in 2007. During her background \ninterview, she reported that her psychiatrist approved of her tapering off of her prescribed \nmedications. Shortly after the interview, her investigation was terminated since Applicant \nno longer worked for the employer who sponsored her for the security clearance.5  \n \n \n \nIn May 2018, in connection with her current application, Applicant was asked by \nDOD to undergo an evaluation with a licensed clinical psychologist, during the course of \nher investigation for a position of trust. After the evaluation and psychological testing, \nApplicant was diagnosed with delusional disorder, chronic, paranoid type; major \ndepressive disorder, severe, in partial remission; and unspecified anxiety disorder. During \nthe evaluation, she again expressed thoughts that others were talking about her in a \nnegative manner. Although she has been diagnosed with a STD that can lead to cancer, \nthe psychologist noted her preoccupation with having cancer bordered on delusional. \nApplicant discontinued her hobbies of exercising and going to church, which had helped \nimprove her mental health status in the past. Applicant\u2019s previous treatment records were \nalso considered in the evaluation. The DOD psychologist determined that given \nApplicant\u2019s mental health history, lack of treatment, lack of engagement of activities that \nreportedly helped stabilize her mood, and her limited insight, Applicant\u2019s prognosis was \npoor. The psychologist opined that her mental health status may impair her judgment, \nreliability, or ability to properly safeguard classified information.6 \n \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. 23-29, 39-44, 56-57; GE 3, GE 5. \n \n4 Tr. 30-33, 35-36, 45-47, 57, 63-64. \n \n5 GE 5. \n \n6 GE 3. Note \u2013 this is for a position of trust, not a DOD security clearance. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn December 27, 2018, Applicant participated a psychological evaluation via video \nteleconference at her counsel\u2019s request. The examination showed Applicant had logical, \nclear thought patterns, rational ideation, and normal perceptive processing. The evaluator \ndetermined that Applicant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) due to a \ntraumatic break-up of a relationship and the resulting STD.7 Applicant was found to be a \nwell-adjusted wife, stepmother, and employee, and has successfully overcome the \ntrauma from the past that negatively impacted her life. Applicant has not had any \ndepressive or self-harming incidents within the last decade. Applicant\u2019s diagnosis by the \ncredentialed licensed clinical social worker, certified substance abuse counselor, master \naddiction counselor, and substance abuse professional, was \u201cno disorder\u201d with\u201d no \ntreatment recommended.\u201d8 The social worker did not have Applicant\u2019s previous medical \nrecords, but she did have a copy of the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s previous psychologist, who had treated her in 2005-2006, provided a \nletter dated January 19, 2019.9 It pertinent part, it reads as follows: \n \n\u201cI am writing this treatment summary letter at the request of (Applicant). \u2026I \nsaw her for a total of 52 visits between (January 2005) and (July 2006). \u2026She \nreported that she was finally terminated because she sent a \u2018paranoid\u2019 email, \nwhich was deemed inappropriate. \u2026She indicated that she had difficulties at \nthat job because she complained that other team members were \nsurreptitiously reading the documents she was working on. As (Applicant) \nand I continued to work together, she began to reveal more overtly paranoid \nideation. For example, she complained of being watched in her home and \nthat there were cameras in her house. Because of this she felt compelled to \ndress in the dark. \u2026she reported that she overheard people talking about \nher in the places she was interviewing. \u2026she seemed to misinterpret far off \nconversations. In June 2005, she told me that she no longer wanted to see \n(psychiatrist) because she heard him playing a tape recording of herself very \nloudly in his office (while she was in the waiting room). \u2026In July 2005, \n(Applicant) reported that she was fearful she would be fired at work because \nshe contacted her supervisor and complained that people at work were \ntalking about her. (Psychiatrist) increased her medication (Seroquel) in July \n2005. By August 2005, her thinking had become much more frankly paranoid. \nShe asked me directly if I had discussed our meetings with other people. She \nalso asked me if my office was \u2018bugged\u2019 or if I electronically recorded our \nsessions. \u2026In the same session, she indicated that she felt the City of \n[Redacted] was going to pay her money because of all the \u2018torment\u2019 she had \nbeen through.   \n \nHer delusions had crystalized around a woman named \u2018Karen\u2019, who she felt \nwas orchestrating all the difficulties she was experiencing. She continued to \nbelieve that people were watching her and talking about her at work. She \n                                                          \n7 Tr. 50-53 \n \n8 AE O.  \n \n9 AE Q. During the hearing I requested Applicant provide any treatment records from her psychiatrist or \npsychologist during the 2004-2008 time period. Applicant\u2019s counsel timely submitted this letter in January \n2019. See also Tr. 57-58, 72.  \n\n \n5 \n \nthought they were taking pictures of her \u2026and circulating them. \u2026 \n(Applicant) began to become more concerned that her neighbors were \ntalking about her and that they had microphones and cameras in her house. \nShe reported that at one point she went outside and yelled at them. In March \n2006, (Applicant) got a job in [State 1]. She was there for a week and quit. \nShe told me she thought \u2018Karen\u2019 was there and was \u2018passing pictures \naround, trying to get me fired.\u2019 Similarly, she got a job in [State 2] and \nreturned within a month with similar concerns. I last saw her on July 19, 2006.  \n \n\u2026we worked on identifying her delusional thoughts and dismissing them as \n\u2018faulty processing.\u2019 \u2026During therapy, I felt (Applicant) made marginal \nprogress in dealing with her distressing thoughts, as is common with such \npatients because of the intractability of their belief system. The working \ndiagnosis in her treatment was DSM 5 Delusional Disorder (297.1). \nDelusional Disorder is characterized by at least one month of delusions, but \nno other psychotic symptoms. Delusions are false beliefs based on incorrect \ninferences about external reality that persist despite the evidence to the \ncontrary. Since I have not seen (Applicant) since July 2006, her condition \nand/or her circumstances may have substantially changed.\u201d \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted several character reference letters from her current employer, \npast co-workers, associates and friends. These individuals described Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter traits to include \u201coutstanding, invaluable, professional, team player, and \ntrusted.\u201d She also provided documentation of numerous awards, medals, and positive \nperformance evaluations she has received over the years. Applicant submitted records \nof her volunteer services during 2008-2011.10  \n \nPolicies \n \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may be \nmade. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \n                                                          \n10 AE D, AE E, AE G, AE J. \n\n \n6 \n \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.11 Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.12 An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government.13 An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \nThe Concern. Certain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can \nimpair judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a \ndisorder is not required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly \nqualified mental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or \npsychiatrist) employed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment, should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. (AG \u00b6 27) \n \n \n \n The medical information and reports in evidence raised the following \nPsychological Conditions Disqualifying Conditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n \n                                                          \n11 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n12 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n13 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, or \ntrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed \nmedication or failure to attend required counseling sessions.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges psychological conditions security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s \ndiagnosis in approximately 2005 of delusional disorder \u2013 chronic, paranoid type. In May \n2018, she was diagnosed with delusional disorder chronic - paranoid type; major \ndepressive disorder, severe, in partial remission; and unspecified anxiety disorder. Her \nprognosis was listed as poor. She admitted that she stopped following the psychiatrist\u2019s \ntreatment plan in 2008, which included taking prescribed psychotropic medications. \n \n \nI considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer has indications of emotional \ninstability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nApplicant has not received professional treatment for her diagnosed psychological \nissues since late 2008. Her support group counseling through the church ended in 2011. \nShe does not have any plans to seek mental health counseling in the future. In May 2018, \na qualified mental health professional determined that Applicant\u2019s condition was not under \ncontrol and her prognosis was poor. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29 (a), (b), and (c) do \nnot apply.    \n \n \nThere is a contradictory psychological report from a social worker stating that: \nApplicant\u2019s mental health issues were temporary; she no longer shows signs of emotional \n\n \n8 \n \ninstability; and the security concerns are therefore resolved. The social worked reported \nin the December 2018 psychological evaluation that Applicant presented symptoms of \nPTSD. The final conclusion was that Applicant did not have any other diagnosis and was \nnot in need of further treatment. The social worker had obtained a copy of the SOR, but \ndid not review Applicant\u2019s previous treatment records from 2004-2008, unlike the \npsychologist who performed the May 2018 evaluation.  \n \n \nI find that the information obtained from her earlier treatment record documents \nthat Applicant\u2019s delusions were a consistent and serious problem over a long period of \ntime. The information also revealed new details than what were not disclosed during her \nhearing. Lastly, the credentials of the social worker, who performed the December 2018 \nevaluation during a video-teleconference, focused her training in the area of substance \nabuse or addiction issues, and not in psychological testing, diagnoses, and disorders. I \ngive more weight to the May 2018 evaluation, which included Applicant\u2019s previous \ntreatment information and testing, and the evaluation was conducted by a licensed clinical \npsychologist. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 29 (d) and (e) are not applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline I and the AG \u00b6 \n2(d) factors in this whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to positions of trust. In deciding whether to grant \nor continue access to sensitive information or sensitive duties, the Federal government \ncan take into account facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed \nlight on the person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security \nclearance decisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work \nor duty hours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, her off-duty conduct or \n\n \n9 \n \ncircumstances can have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the \napplicant's trustworthiness eligibility. Moreover, to the extent that Applicant's personal \nconduct sheds any light on her mental condition, it could be relevant to the Guideline I \nissues in this case. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s history of mental illness, which has been \nuntreated since 2008 is serious and concerning, and is not outweighed by positive \nrecommendations from friends, colleagues, or her employer. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental health problems have persisted since 2005, and there is no \nevidence that these problems are under control or unlikely to recur. After evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe psychological conditions security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public \ntrust position. Eligibility for public trust position is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 20, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on April 25, \n2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned \nto me on June 24, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on August 8, 2019.  \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which \nwere admitted without objection.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Sudan. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that Sudan has been a state \nsponsor of terrorism with a dismal human rights record. Terrorists groups are active in \nSudan. Armed conflicts have raged in and around Sudan, and the government was \nrecently overthrown, resulting in a national state of emergency.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He will \nbe hired if he receives a security clearance. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from a \nLebanese university and a master\u2019s degree from a university in the United States. He \nmarried in 1989 and divorced in 2017. He has three children. (Tr. at 23, 26-27, 34; GE \n1-4) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He came to the United States \non a student visa in 1989. He became a U.S. citizen in 1995. His ex-wife is a native-\nborn U.S. citizen. His children were born in the United States. (Tr. at 27; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant parents are deceased. His five siblings are citizens and residents of \nSudan. None of his family members have any direct connection to the Sudanese \ngovernment. He provided some financial support to his family in Sudan when he had the \nmeans to do so. He last visited his family in Sudan in 2014. He communicates with his \nfamily in Sudan through electronic media. He inherited some property in Sudan with his \nsiblings after his father passed away, but he thought his siblings sold the property. He \ndoes not own any other property in Sudan. He owned a home in the United States, but \nhis ex-wife received it in their divorce. He credibly testified that he is loyal to the United \nStates, and that his family in Sudan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into \nrevealing classified information. (Tr. at 25-26, 35-36, 50-57; GE 1-4) \n \n \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist in support of the U.S. \nmission in Iraq from about 2004 until 2013. He held a security clearance at the time. \nLike the U.S. military forces he supported, he came under fire. He submitted documents \nand a letter from U.S. military and other personnel attesting to his excellent job \nperformance while at risk to his own safety. (Tr. at 20-21, 28-29; GE 1-3; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from about February 2013 through November 2013 \nand November 2015 until at least October 2017. He also went through extended periods \nof underemployment, and he was unemployed as of the hearing date. He indicated that \nhis ex-wife did not pay all their bills while he was working overseas, and his divorce also \ncontributed to his financial difficulties. He was unable to pay all his bills, and a number \nof debts became delinquent. (Tr. at 21-22, 29-34, 44-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 2)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling $11,062. Four of the debts, \ntotaling $3,362, are defaulted student loans. The allegations are established through \ncredit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that he took out six student loans in 2001 and \n2002. The high credit on those six loans totaled more than $81,000. Two loans, with \nhigh credit totaling about $45,000, appear to have been paid off in 2011. The remaining \nfour loans are the loans alleged in the SOR. The high credit on those four loans totaled \nmore $40,000. Because of interest, the high credit amounts could be more than the \namount that was actually borrowed. As indicated in the SOR and the most recent credit \nreports, the balances on the four loans were paid down to a total of $3,362. Applicant \ntestified that he was in recent contact with the creditor handling his student loans. He \nstated that his income tax refund was withheld to pay his student loans, and the balance \ndue on the loans is now about $2,600. The creditor will settle the debt for $2,050 if it is \npaid within 90 days. (Tr. at 40-41, 50-51; GE 5-7) \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a nonprofit debt-management organization in July 2019 \nto assist him in resolving his debts. He agreed to pay $110 per month, which will be \nused to pay his debts. He stated that within a few months of getting his job and working \noverseas, he will easily be able to pay his delinquent debts and student loans. He \ncredibly testified that he will do so. (Tr. at 24-25, 36-43, 49; AE-B) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nSudan has been a state sponsor of terrorism with a dismal human rights record. \nTerrorists groups are active in Sudan. Armed conflicts have raged in and around Sudan, \nand the government was recently overthrown, resulting in a national state of \nemergency. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Sudan. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas in support of the \nnational defense. His children are U.S. citizens and residents. He credibly testified that \nhis family in Sudan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing \n\n \n6 \n \nclassified information. The Appeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing \nalone, is of limited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in \na similar manner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a \nprevious track record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the \ncontext of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant \ncontribution to the national security. See, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nJune 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nI find that Applicant\u2019s ties to Sudan are outweighed by his deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is unlikely he will \nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the United States \nand the interests of Sudan. There is no conflict of interest, because he can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. The above mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant \nattributed \nhis \nfinancial \nproblems \nto \nhis \nunemployment, \nunderemployment, his ex-wife\u2019s failure to pay all their bills while he was working \noverseas, and his divorce. \n \nApplicant retained the services of a nonprofit debt-management organization in \nJuly 2019. He has done little of consequence to actually pay the debts since the SOR \nwas issued. However, he is unemployed and has been unable to address his debts \nbeyond his promise to take care of them after he receives a security clearance and \nreturns to working overseas. The Appeal Board has held that intentions to pay debts in \nthe future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013).  \n \nApplicant does not have a track record of debt repayment since the SOR was \nissued, but inspection of his student loans provides insight. He took out six student \n\n \n8 \n \nloans in 2001 and 2002. The total balance of those loans was more than $81,000 at one \ntime. While working and able to pay them, he paid around $78,000 in principal and an \nunknown amount in interest. He reduced the balance to about $3,362 at the time the \nSOR was issued. That is a track record of debt repayment. The balance was further \nreduced by a withholding of his income tax refund. I am convinced that once he is fully \nemployed, Applicant will pay the remainder of his student loans as well as his other \ndebts. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s work overseas in support of the national defense. The Appeal Board has \nheld that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the United States is very \nimportant and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d \nISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). The complicated state of affairs in \nSudan places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nforeign family members do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has met that \nburden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence and financial considerations security concerns.1 \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nissues are completely mitigated, and that Applicant will address his financial issues without additional \nmonitoring.  \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.u-1.kk. She stated that the state tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c had been paid, and that the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u-1.kk were disputed and removed from her credit record. At the hearing, Department Counsel conceded that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c had been paid and withdrew that allegation. (Tr. 9.) Applicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old customer-service auditor employed by a defense contractor since March 2017. She married in July 2004 and divorced in October 2011. She has two children, ages 15 and 10.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2019. \nFindings of Fact2 \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.d-1.t, and 1.ll. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.u-1.kk. She stated \nthat the state tax lien alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c had been paid, and that the medical debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u-1.kk were disputed and removed from her credit record. At the \nhearing, Department Counsel conceded that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c had been \npaid and withdrew that allegation. (Tr. 9.) Applicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the \nSOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old customer-service auditor employed by a defense \ncontractor since March 2017. She married in July 2004 and divorced in October 2011. \nShe has two children, ages 15 and 10. (Tr. 20.) She has been employed continuously in \nvarious jobs since at least January 2007, the period covered in her e-QIP. She has \nnever held a security clearance or eligibility for a public trust position. \nApplicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May 2015. It was \ndismissed in February 2016 for failure to make the required payments. (Tr. 23.). When \nthe petition was dismissed, $400 had been disbursed to creditors and $689 had been \ndisbursed for administrative expenses. (GX 4; GX 5.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.ll allege debts \nreflected in Applicant\u2019s credit reports from April 2017 (GX 2) and June 2018 (GX 3) and \ntotaling about $40,000. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.kk are medical debts \ntotaling about $2,000. The evidence pertaining to the debts alleged in the SOR is \nsummarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: judgment for $1,710 filed in July 2017. This judgment was for \nunpaid rent. Applicant has taken no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 24.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: deficiency after repossession of a car, placed for collection of \n$9,528. Applicant has taken no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 27.) \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: student loan placed for collection of $3,801. Applicant incurred \nthis loan when she attended college from August 1997 to May 1998. She has made no \npayments on this debt. (GX 1 at 14; Tr. 27.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: credit-card account past due for $2,692. The last activity on this \naccount was in October 2013. (GX 2 at 5.) Applicant has made no payments since that \ndate and has taken no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 28.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $453. Applicant \nhas taken no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 28.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: past-due rent placed for collection of $3,554. Applicant incurred \nthis debt in January through July 2016. She has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 29.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.n, 1.p, 1.s, and 1.t: medical bills in various amounts. Applicant \ntestified that she believed these bills were covered by Medicaid. She contacted the \ncreditors and gave them her Medicaid account number, but she did not know whether \nthe creditors submitted any of the bills to Medicaid. She has not contacted these \ncreditors since March 2017, has not made any payments on these bills, and has not \nfiled disputes with the credit bureaus or taken any other action to resolve them. (Tr. 32\u00ad\n34.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: gym membership account placed for collection of $947. \nApplicant was uncertain when she incurred this debt, but she believed it was in 2014. \nShe has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 33.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.r: cellphone bills placed for collection of $520 and $416. \nThese bills were incurred at the same time for two different lines. Applicant has taken no \naction to resolve them. (Tr. 33-34.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u-1.kk: various medical bills placed for collection. Applicant \ntestified that she disputed the debts online on the ground that the bills should have been \ncovered by Medicaid. (Tr. 35.) The debts are not reflected in her March 2019 credit \nreport. (AX A.) They are resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.ll: past-due rent placed for collection of $4,478. Applicant testified \nthat she contacted the creditor in early 2018 and disputed the amount due. She testified \nthat she owed rent for two months, totaling $1,600, but the creditor claimed that she \nowed more because of trash in the apartment. (Tr. 49.) She testified that the creditor \nwould not accept less than the full amount. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant lived in this apartment \nuntil June 2018, when she moved into a house that she inherited from her father. (Tr. \n38-39.) She has not made any payments, established a payment plan, filed a dispute \nwith the credit bureaus, or taken any other action to resolve this debt.  \nApplicant earns between $1,000 and $1,200 per month, depending on how many \nhours she works. Her son receives $140 per month because his father is disabled. She \nhas no savings or investment accounts. Her medical expenses are now covered by \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMedicaid. She receives no child support from the fathers of her two children. She has \nnever sought or received financial counseling, other than what was required for her \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. She suffers from diabetes and chronic migraines, which are \nsometimes severe enough to keep her from going to work. (Tr. 39-46) \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the Manual and the adjudicative \nguidelines for assignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness are such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal  is a fair,  \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nAn applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establishes \nthe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s diabetes and chronic migraines are \nconditions largely beyond her control, but she has not acted responsibly. She has not \ntaken any action to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.h, 1.o-1.r, and 1.ll. She \ninitially disputed the medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.n, 1.p, 1.s, and 1.t, but she \nhas taken no further follow-up action since March 2017. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received any financial \ncounseling except the financial counseling required in connection with her Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition. Her financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments or \npayment agreements for her delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u-1.kk. It is \nnot established for the other debts alleged in the SOR. She has not submitted \ndocumentary evidence showing the basis for disputes of the medical debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.n, 1.p, 1.s, and 1.t, and she has not followed up on her contacts with the \ncreditors since March 2017. She testified that she disputed the amount of the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ll, but she submitted no documentary evidence of the basis for the \ndispute, and it has not been resolved. She has not disputed the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.h and 1.o-1.r. Although she disputed some of the non-medical debts with the \noriginal creditors, she submitted no evidence that she filed disputes with the credit \nbureaus. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2.d. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn\n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.r: \n \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \nSubparagraphs 1.u-1.kk:  \n \n \nFor\n \nApplicant\n \nSubparagraph 1.ll:  \n \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

Thompson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \nMay 22, 2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nOn December 20, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(SF-86). On September 7, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.) The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 26, 2018. She admitted all of the SOR \nallegations concerning her delinquent debts, and requested that her case be decided by \nan administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 2.) On November \n30, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ncopy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, was mailed to \nApplicant on December 4, 2018, and received by her on December 14, 2018. The \nFORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant failed to respond to the FORM.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. (Item 1 at page 7.) She is divorced, and has two adult \nchildren. (Item 1 at pages 15, and 18~19.) \n \n \n1.a.~1.hh. Applicant admits to 34 past-due debts totaling about $28,601. (Item 2.) \nShe offers nothing further in this regard. These allegations are found against Applicant. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness that she has yet to address. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes seven conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of these apply. Applicant has not acted responsibly in addressing any of \nher past-due debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance.

National security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 6, 2017. On \nSeptember 7, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse. Applicant answered the SOR on October 9, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (Answer). On October 30, 2018, the Government sent \nApplicant an amendment to the SOR alleging security concerns under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. Applicant answered the amendment on November 12, 2018, which I \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.  \n \nI was assigned to the case on March 8, 2019, and on April 3, 2019, I issued an \norder to both parties to produce their documentary evidence by April 29, 2019. On April \n8, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for May 15, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted, without objection. Applicant \ntestified, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B were admitted, without objection. I \nreceived the complete transcript (Tr.) on June 3, 2019, and the record closed.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 59 years old, single, and has no children. He lives with his mother \nand is her primary caregiver. Applicant received a high school diploma in 1978 and has \nattended approximately three years of college. He served in the U.S. Navy (USN) from \n1986 until 1992, when he was honorably discharged. Applicant also actively drilled in \nthe U.S. Navy Reserve (USNR) in 1995. (GE 1 at 16; GE 2 at 23-24; GE 3 at 4; AE A; \nTr. 10-15, 21-23) \n \nApplicant held a secret security clearance when he served on active duty in the \nUSN. He has worked for defense contractors since 2005, and he has held a clearance \nsince 2007. He currently works casually for a defense contractor as an electrician \ntechnologist and requires a clearance for his continued employment. (GE 1; GE 2; GE \n3; AE A; Tr. 10-15, 21-23) \n \n \nApplicant started using marijuana in 1977 while he was in high school. (Tr. 26) \nFrom 1980 until he joined the USN in 1986, he used marijuana once every two to three \nmonths. He did not use marijuana again until he left active duty in 1992. (Tr. 26) After \nhe was discharged from the USN, Applicant returned to his family\u2019s farm and resumed \nusing marijuana socially with friends. From 1992 until 1995, he was in the USN\u2019s \nindividual ready reserve (IRR), and he was not required to drill or take urinalysis tests. \n(GE 3 at 8; Tr. 26, 27-30) \n \n \nIn June 1995, shortly after Applicant joined the USNR, he took a random \nurinalysis, which tested positive for marijuana. As a result of the positive test, Applicant \nwas discharged from the USNR with an other than honorable discharge (OTH). He \ntestified that he never received the discharge paperwork from the USN; therefore, he \nwas unaware that he received an OTH discharge. However, at the hearing, he admitted \nthat he was ashamed of his positive urinalysis, and he did not investigate or request the \ndischarge paperwork from the USNR. (Answer; GE 3 at 8; GE 4; Tr. 27-29) \n \n \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after his 1995 discharge from the USNR, \nand he was arrested for possession of marijuana in 2000 or 2001 and fined. (GE 1 at \n42; GE 2 at 28; GE 3 at 7-8; Tr. 31, 53) As stated above, Applicant started working for \ndefense contractors in 2005. After he received a clearance in 2007, he continued to use \nmarijuana. In 2008 and 2010, Applicant changed employers but continued to work for \ndefense contractors and maintained a security clearance. (HE I; Tr. 32-33)  \n \nThroughout his time working for defense contractors, Applicant has worked for \nextended periods in various locations overseas and within the United States. He \ntestified that while working at these temporary locations, he did not use marijuana, and \nhis use was only when he was home and near his friends. Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana socially despite being aware of the federal laws and his various employers\u2019 \n\n \n3 \n \npolicies regarding drug use while holding a clearance. (Answer; GE 1 at 9; GE 3 at 2-3, \n8; Tr. 13, 31-34, 37, 42, 44-47)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he stopped using marijuana in 2014 due to a scare \nassociated with a work-related urinalysis before a deployment to Pakistan. He did not \ntest positive for marijuana and \u201cfell through the cracks.\u201d He admitted that this was the \nonly urinalysis he had taken since 1995, other than a pre-employment urinalysis for a \nprevious employer. (HE I; Tr. 39-44, 49) \n \nPrior to the hearing, Applicant reported his marijuana use in a November 2007 \nSCA, a July 2007 SCA, and in an October 2017 personal subject interview (PSI). \nApplicant was inconsistent in his reporting of his marijuana use. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3) \n \nIn his November 2007 SCA, Applicant reported that he used marijuana 10 to 15 \ntimes between 1994 and 2001. At the hearing, he claimed that he was not trying to be \ndeceptive in the 2007 SCA. He testified that his failure to disclose the full extent of his \ndrug use in the 2007 SCA was the result of potential mental fatigue or misinterpretation \nof the relevant questions. (HE I; GE 2 at 29; Tr. 34, 36-38) \n \nThe following colloquy occurred during the hearing regarding Applicant\u2019s \ndisclosure of drug use in his 2007 SCA: \n \n \nAJ: Do you think you minimized the number of times you used [marijuana]? \n \nApplicant: I downplayed it. Really I don\u2019t know how many times I\u2019ve used \n[marijuana]. I never thought I had problem other than the fact that I, you \nknow, I think I stated this that my problem was taking this too lightly. And \nthinking there was at time and place when it wasn\u2019t bad. (Tr. 38) \n \n \nIn his July 2017 SCA, Applicant reported that he used marijuana 25 to 30 times \nbetween 1980 and 2014. At the hearing that he claimed he forgot what he had reported \nin his 2007 SCA regarding his drug use but was not trying to be deceptive. He also \nadmitted during questioning that his use of marijuana was \u201ccloser to 100 times then \ncloser to 25.\u201d (GE 1 at 43-44; HE I; Tr. 35, 39, 54-55)  \n \nIn his October 2017 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he used marijuana \none time in 1977; he used marijuana once every two to three months between 1980 and \n1986; he did not smoke marijuana between 1986 and 1992 while he was on active duty \nin the U.S. Navy; he used marijuana two to three times a year between 1992 and 2010; \nand he used marijuana fifteen times between 2010 and 2014. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. 26, 35-36, \n39) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he did not disclose to his current and \nformer employers and facility security officers that he used marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 49-50) In his response to the SOR amendment, Applicant wrote, \n\u201cDuring the process of background questionnaires and interviews I did not want to \nappear to have a problem with marijuana, but I\u2019m basically very honest. I understated \n\n \n4 \n \nthe frequency of marijuana use.\u201d He acknowledged that he used to have a problem with \nmarijuana, but he has never sought treatment or counseling related to his marijuana \nuse. (HE I; Tr. 52-53)  \n \nApplicant submitted an October 7, 2018 statement of intent to abstain from the \nuse of drugs and testified that he intends to abstain from using marijuana in the future. \n(AE B; Tr. 49) At the hearing, Applicant testified that his drug use was immature, he is a \nchanged person, and he regrets using marijuana as an adult. At this point he \ninfrequently sees his friends with whom he used marijuana. (Answer; HE I; Tr. 17, 38, \n48) \n \nApplicant received the following awards and decorations when he was \ndischarged from active duty in 1992: Good Conduct Medal; Humanitarian Service \nMedal; Southwest Asia Service Medal with bronze star; National Defense Service \nMedal; Sea Service Deployment Ribbon; and Joint Meritorious Unit Sward with oak \ncluster. (AE A; Tr. 15, 18-20) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic \nterm adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed \nabove. \nThe record evidence established the following disqualifying conditions under AG \n\u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n \n(f) any illegal use while granted access to classified information or holding \na sensitive position. \n\n \n6 \n \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to rebut or prove mitigation of the resulting \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in \nthis case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not fully established. Although it has been approximately five years \nsince he last used marijuana, Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of using marijuana while \nholding a clearance is concerning. His use occurred over an almost 40-year-period, and \nextended into his fifties, while he worked for multiple defense contractors and the \nUSNR.  Applicant\u2019s use of illegal drugs did not occur under unusual circumstances, \neach use occurred in a social setting.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant has expressed his intent not to use \ndrugs in the future and provided a letter of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse. However, his promises to abstain from illegal drug use are \nundercut by his testimony and the record evidence. Applicant used drugs while he was \nin the USNR and in 1995 tested positive for marijuana. Despite being ashamed by the \npositive urinalysis and subsequent discharge, Applicant used marijuana after he applied \nfor and received a DOD clearance in 2007.  \n \nApplicant chose to use illegal drugs, and his decision to do so continues to reflect \nnegatively on his current security worthiness. Applicant\u2019s decision to use illegal drugs, \nespecially after being granted a security clearance, cannot be considered a minor lapse \nin judgment, but is, instead, a pattern of behavior that indicates an unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations. Security clearance decisions are not limited to conduct \nduring duty hours;1 off-duty conduct, especially where it reflects poor judgment, \n                                                          \n1 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0620 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 22, 1999). \n \n\n \n7 \n \nprovides a rational basis for the government to question an applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness.2 Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s eventual self-reporting of his illegal drug use does \nnot change the security significance of the underlying conduct. At this time his \nsupervisor and facility security officer are still unaware that Applicant used marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance. Applicant engaged in an activity he knew to be in \ndirect contravention of federal law and his responsibilities as an individual holding a \nsecurity clearance. His behavior showed a disregard for the law, regulations, and the \nfiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered into with the Government when he was \ngranted access to classified information. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or \n                                                          \n2 See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 U.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. \n320, 321 n.1 (1989). \n \n\n \n8 \n \nstatus, determine national security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose the full extent of his marijuana use in his November \n2007 SCA. Although he claimed that he did not intend to deceive the Government, the \ntotality of the record evidence demonstrates that he purposely minimized the length of \ntime that he used marijuana and the frequency of his use. The evidence established the \nabove disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant held a clearance while he served on active duty in the USN and he did \nnot use marijuana during his service from 1986 until 1992 while he held a security \nclearance. However, when he applied for a clearance in 2007, Applicant did not provide \nan accurate description of the history and frequency that he used marijuana. Although \nhe provided some explanations that he was suffering from mental fatigue or \nmisunderstood the relevant questions, upon further questioning, he admitted that he \nminimized his marijuana use in the 2007 SCA.  \n \nThe SOR did not allege that Applicant falsified his 2017 SCA; however, the \nrecord evidence demonstrated that he minimized the frequency of use in his second \nsecurity application as well. His failure to be honest in the second SCA further \nunderscores that the failure to report was purposeful and not a mistake. \nThe SOR also did not cross-allege Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a \nclearance under Guideline E; however, his decision to use marijuana after he received a \nsecurity clearance further demonstrates a pattern of behavior that indicates his \nunwillingness to follow rules and regulations. The evidence does not establish \npersuasive mitigation under AG under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c).     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the drug \ninvolvement concerns and the personal conduct concerns. Accordingly, Applicant has \nnot carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings  \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n__________________________ \nCaroline E.

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/21/2019 \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 25, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on February 21, 2019, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 24, \n2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on August 7, 2019.  \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iraq. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer for almost two years. He has the equivalent of a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nHe is married with two children. (Tr. at 31, 70; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He performed 18 months of \nmandatory military service from 1998 to 1999. His wife and two children were also born \nin Iraq. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother applied for his family, including Applicant, Applicant\u2019s \nwife, and Applicant\u2019s children, to immigrate to the United States as refugees. The \npetition was approved. Applicant, his wife, and their children immigrated to the United \nStates in 2009. They all became U.S. citizens in 2015. (Tr. at 19-20, 52-53; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents have been separated for a long time. His mother and four \nsiblings have all immigrated to the United States and are U.S. citizens. Two of his \nsiblings work as linguists supporting the U.S. military; one in Saudi Arabia and one in \nSyria. His brother in Syria has a DOD security clearance. A third sibling served in the \nU.S. military. Applicant and most of his family are dual citizens of the United States and \nIraq. (Tr. at 23-29, 58-60, 71; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father at one time was relatively senior in the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs, but he left that position more than 30 years ago. He has lived in Turkey for about \n15 years. Applicant is not close to his father and only has sporadic contact with him. He \nhas not seen him in about 15 years, and he has not had any other contact with him \nsince about 2015. (Tr. at 25-26, 38-42, 53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is deceased. His mother-in-law and siblings-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq. His brother-in-law who submitted the refugee petition \ndecided not to immigrate to the United States. He served in the Iraqi military for about \n18 years and currently works in an administrative position in the Iraqi government. \nApplicant\u2019s other sibling-in-law works for the Iraqi government in the health section. (Tr. \nat 21, 37, 60-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \n \nApplicant has worked under dangerous conditions in Iraq as a linguist for the \nU.S. military for about 16 months. A U.S. military officer wrote a glowing \nrecommendation for Applicant to obtain a security clearance. He wrote that Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cperformance has been exemplary in every way,\u201d and that he is confident to serve with \nApplicant \u201cin garrison or in combat.\u201d Applicant credibly testified that his family in Iraq \nand Turkey could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. (Tr. at 43-51; AE A) \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is an Iraqi citizen living in Turkey. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law \nand siblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. The potential for terrorist violence \nagainst U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it continues to have human \nrights problems. The same is true for Turkey. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and through his wife. The above \ndisqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s brothers are dual citizens of Iraq and the United States. Two of his \nbrothers work in Saudi Arabia and Syria as linguists supporting the U.S. military. Their \n\n \n5 \n \nwork in those countries does not raise security concerns. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are \nconcluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq and Turkey. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \nand Turkey could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. The Appeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of \nlimited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar \nmanner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous \ntrack record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the \nnational security. See, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In \nISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed \nthis issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n\n \n6 \n \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant has worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist for the U.S. \nmilitary in Iraq for about 16 months. A U.S. military officer who worked with him praised \nhis service. I find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him high praise from a U.S. \nmilitary officer. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action \nin defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for \nan applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). \nThe complicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his foreign family members do not pose an unacceptable \nsecurity risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He is praised for his trustworthiness, honesty, \nreliability, dependability, professionalism, work ethic, dedication, and integrity.9 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 32-33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4; AE P, S, T. \n \n8 Tr. at 31-39, 42-52; AE J-M. \n \n9 Tr. at 13-23; AE G-I. \n\n \n4 \n \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant did not file his federal income tax returns when they were due for tax \nyears 2012 through 2016, and he did not file his state income tax returns when they \nwere due for tax years 2013 through 2016. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying condition.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter has had significant medical problems since birth, resulting \nin multiple surgeries and periods where she could not physically go to school. She had \nto be homeschooled at one point. His wife missed worked while she stayed home to \ncare for their daughter, and his wife also has had persistent medical problems. \n \n \nApplicant let his finances and taxes languish while he and his wife cared for their \ndaughter. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns and pay his taxes when required \nraises some questions about his judgment. However, he filed all the tax returns before \nthe SOR was issued. He owes the IRS, but he has an installment agreement with the \nIRS, and he is in compliance with that agreement. His daughter\u2019s health is better; she is \nin high school; and Applicant\u2019s wife returned to full-time employment in January 2019. \nApplicant and his wife credibly testified that they are committed to their installment \n\n \n6 \n \nagreement with the IRS and that all future income tax returns will be filed when \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were the result of conditions that were beyond his \ncontrol. He has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant actions \nto implement that plan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) are applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nare partially applicable. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s excellent character evidence. He is a hard-\nworking man who was overwhelmed by his daughter\u2019s medical problems. She is doing \nbetter, and his finances are back on track. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Perry, Esq.  \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the foreign influence and foreign preference security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 7, 2016. \nOn September 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline C, foreign preference. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 7, 2018, denying all of the SOR \nallegations under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline C, foreign preference. \nApplicant also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on January 25, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n03/20/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 26, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 - 3 were admitted into evidence without objection. At \nthe hearing, Applicant testified, and he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 N, which \nwere admitted without objection. He had a character reference witness testify on his \nbehalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 6, 2019.  \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nrelating to Turkey. Applicant did not object and the request was approved.

Some of the facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact below.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice - Turkey \n \nThe request listed supporting documents to show detail and context for those \nfacts. A risk assessment in this case necessitates administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Turkey. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the HE 1 \nsource documents, and incorporated them by reference. The facts are summarized in \nthe written request and will not be repeated in this decision. However, of particular note \nare the following salient facts from HE 1: \n \nNotwithstanding the long-time strategic U.S. \u2013 Turkey relationship, current \ncountry conditions are problematic.  The U.S. State Department urges citizens to avoid \ntravel to Turkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups explicitly \ntarget Western tourists and expatriates for kidnapping and assassination. The potential \nfor terrorist attacks in Turkey, including against U.S. citizens and interests, remains \nhigh. The U.S. Government does not allow family members to accompany personnel \nassigned to the U.S. Consulate in Adana unless they are working in the Consulate. \nTurkey is a transit country for foreign terrorist fighters wishing to join the Islamic State of \nIraq and Syria (ISIS) and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq. Since a July \n2016 coup attempt, the Turkish Government has operated under a state of emergency, \nwith far reaching effects on the country\u2019s society and institutions, restricting the exercise \nof many fundamental freedoms. Profound and significant human-rights abuses persist.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old.

(Tr. 77)  \n \n \nApplicant presented testimony from his supervisor who was also simultaneously \nserving as a military reservist. The witness testified that he was a master sergeant in the \nU.S. Army reserve with 17 years of active duty. He hired Applicant and directly \nsupervised him on the job as a federal contractor. (Tr. 38-40) He testified that Kurds are \ncommonly persecuted in Turkey, and they are in disfavor. He testified that Applicant is \nhonest, reliable, and loyal to the U.S. He would have no hesitation recommending \nApplicant for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that his Turkish passport expired in 2014 and he affirmatively \nrenounced his Turkish citizenship in 2018 through the Turkish Embassy in the U.S. (Tr. \n34, 54, 61) He currently works for one federal contractor, but he is sponsored for a \nsecurity clearance by another contractor to be a linguist. (Tr. 42) He testified credibly \nthat Kurds are not allowed to keep their own names in Turkey and there is widespread \nprejudice against them. (Tr. 45-49) He has no real estate interests, bank accounts, or \nother financial interests in Turkey. (Tr. 50) He has no plan to live in Turkey again. (Tr. \n79) He has never been approached by government \u2013 intelligence services during his \nvisits to Turkey. (Tr. 53)  \n \n \nApplicant was married previously from 2002 to 2009, and he came to the U.S. on \na student visa, sponsored by his first wife. She was a U.S. citizen.

(Tr. 82) His two brothers are in the cleaning business. He \ncontacts them, and his sister, about once every three months. (Tr. 85) He does not \nstand to inherit anything from his parents. (Tr. 85)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 7, 2016.2 \nIn section 19 (Foreign Contacts) of his SCA, he disclosed his foreign family members \nliving in Turkey. In section 20B (Foreign Activities) he disclosed that he was involved as \npresident of the People\u2019s Democratic Union (\u201cHDP\u201d) political party from January 2016 to \nJuly 2016. He explained that it was the third largest political party in Turkey. He \naccepted the unpaid position to bolster his resume with volunteer experience.3 He \n                                                          \n2 GE 1. \n \n3 GE 1, p. 63. \n\n \n4 \n \nmajored in political science in college. He was contacted by a citizen of Denmark to \noperate this organization because that individual needed Applicant\u2019s social security \nnumber to set up the non-profit organization. (Tr. 99) His duties were primarily \nadministrative. The stated goals of this non-profit organization were to promote human \nrights and it was generally opposed to the Turkish government.

Essentially, he voted because he \ndisagreed with the incumbent Turkish government\u2019s human-rights abuses and policies. \nHe now votes in U.S. elections. His parents are retired professionals and were never \ninvolved with the Turkish Government or politics. His family members believe that \nApplicant is in the information technology industry, and he does not discuss his work \nwith them.

(AE D,E,H) He also \nprovided a letter from the dean of his university stating that Applicant was on the dean\u2019s \nlist for one semester (AE I), plus copies of his college transcript and diplomas from his \nundergraduate and master\u2019s degrees. (AE K,L,M)  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n\n \n6 \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, sister, and two brothers, are citizens and residents of \nTurkey. He contacts his mother weekly as a dutiful son via Skype, and his siblings less \nfrequently. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are \nimplicated by the evidence. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents and \nsiblings, who are citizens and residents of Turkey, creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a long-standing preference for working and living in \nthe U.S. for the last 22 years. He is sponsored by a federal contractor for employment \noverseas as a linguist and he expressed a willingness to serve in dangerous conditions. \nHe has the background, upbringing, and understanding of languages and culture that is \ninvaluable to U.S. foreign interests. Although he is presumed to have strong bonds of \naffection with his parents and siblings in Turkey, these bonds are not sufficient to offset \nor overcome his demonstrated, long-term commitment to the U.S. and intention to \ncontinue in its service under dangerous conditions.4  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \n                                                          \n4 The Appeal Board has held that \u201can Applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the United States \nis very important and can lead to a favorable result for an Applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case \n04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. March 20, 2007). \n \n\n \n7 \n \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.5  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations \nagainst the U.S., or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are Turkish citizens residing in Turkey, and his siblings are \ncitizens and residents of Turkey, which is an unstable regime. His contact with them is \ninfrequent by Skype. There is no indication that any of his family members are affiliated \nwith the Turkish government or intelligence services. Applicant\u2019s foreign family \nmembers do not pose an unacceptable security risk. His wife and child are in the U.S., \nand his future lies here. He has no plan to return to Turkey. There is sufficient evidence \nto conclude that Applicant would report contacts with his relatives by foreign intelligence \nagents, and that he has a long-term commitment to the U.S. All of the mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6 8 are applicable to the contacts with family members, which are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.b.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the security concern about foreign preference stating: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including: \n \n                                                          \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by any \ncountry other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment,        \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests; \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 lists some examples that raise foreign preference concerns. Applicant \nvoted in a Turkish election one time, he was president of HDP for a six month period, \nand he previously possessed a Turkish passport. If his fleeting participation in HDP \nwere determined to be participation in foreign activities, then \u00b6 10(d) might be applicable \nto demonstrate foreign preference and raise a security concern.     \n \nAG \u00b6 11 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; \n \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference; \n \n(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign \ncitizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; \n \n(d) the exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen; \n \n(e) the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not \npresent a national security concern; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(f) the foreign preference, if detected, involves a foreign country, entity, or \nassociation that poses a low national security risk; \n \n(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or \nthe employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. \nlaw; and \n \n(h) any potentially disqualifying activity took place after receiving the \napproval by the agency head or designee. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b), (c) and (e) apply. Applicant was born to Turkish parents and came \nto the U.S. at age 19. He expressly renounced his Turkish citizenship and he has \napplied for a job as a linguist overseas serving the United States. He is patriotic towards \nthe United States and is willing to sacrifice for the United States. He voted one time in a \nTurkish election with the hope that Turkey would adopt democratic values. That did not \nconflict with U.S. foreign policy or present a national security concern. He also had  \nfleeting involvement with the HDP, but did not view that as contrary to U.S. foreign \npolicy. I do not construe it as participation in foreign activities. He produced \ndocumentary evidence that he renounced his Turkish citizenship. His oath of allegiance \ncontains a renouncement of foreign allegiance. If they ever existed, foreign preference \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline. Applicant is 40 years old. He submitted \ncharacter references from his supervisors attesting to his allegiance to the U.S. Virtually \n\n \n10 \n \nall of his adult work life was spent supporting U.S. interests. He has stepped forward to \nserve as a linguist overseas. He is married with a child and committed to his life here.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no serious questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has  \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns and foreign preference security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                      Paragraph 1, Guideline B:                         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n  FOR APPLICANT \n \n                      Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n               Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n      Robert J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all but one of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., and 1.e.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of defense contractor (A), serving as a linguist, currently deployed to Iraq until the end of 2019. He initially served as a linguist with the U.S. Army in Iraq, training at the Iraqi Police Academy through defense contractor (B) and other unidentified contractors with the U.S. Army in Iraq from July 2006 until December 2008. He subsequently joined defense contractor (B) again in the United States in July 2017, where he remained employed until sometime after he was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in late August 2017, at which time he joined defense contractor (A). All of Applicant\u2019s formal education, including elementary, high school, and college, was received in Iraq. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984. In 1985, during the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Applicant was drafted into the Iraqi Army for the required compulsory military service. Although he was wounded in combat in 1987, he remained on active duty in a non-combat role until he was medically discharged as a 1st lieutenant in 1992. ",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign influence. Eligibility for \na security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 1, 2017, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application (SF 86).1 The Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him on October 9, \n2018, under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered \nindividuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n1 Item 3 (SF 86, dated March 7, 2014). \n04/19/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and \ndetailed reasons why DOD was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The DOD adjudicators \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on October 26, 2018. In a sworn statement prepared \nwith the assistance of his attorney, dated November 12, 2018, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel \nindicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 26, 2018. On January \n2, 2019, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Pre-hearing \nGuidance, and he was advised that his case would be scheduled for a hearing. On \nJanuary 3, 2019, Applicant responded and indicated that he was currently deployed to \nIraq; he was no longer represented by an attorney; and that he would not be available for \na hearing until early 2020. Accordingly, he withdrew his request for a hearing and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He confirmed his \nrequest on January 14, 2019.  \n \nA complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was \nprovided to Applicant on January 15, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity, within 30 \ndays after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non February 12, 2019, signing receipts on that day and on February 18, 2019. A response \nwas due by March 20, 2019. Applicant timely submitted a statement to the FORM which \nwas marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE G), and it was added to the materials \nthat had been attached to his Answer to the SOR, and marked and admitted as AE A \nthrough AE F. The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge on January \n11, 2019, but was reassigned to me on March 26, 2019. \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq), appearing in 11 U.S. \nGovernment publications that were published by the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, as well \nas two citations to public law, on the Internet, but no hard copy of any of those publications \nwas furnished. Facts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable \nby an authorized source and relevant and material to the case.  \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts,2 as set forth below \nunder the Iraq subsection. \n                                                          \n2 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative \nproceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd.

After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration \nof same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of defense contractor (A), serving as a linguist, \ncurrently deployed to Iraq until the end of 2019. He initially served as a linguist with the \nU.S. Army in Iraq, training at the Iraqi Police Academy through defense contractor (B) \nand other unidentified contractors with the U.S. Army in Iraq from July 2006 until \nDecember 2008. He subsequently joined defense contractor (B) again in the United \nStates in July 2017, where he remained employed until sometime after he was \ninterviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in \nlate August 2017, at which time he joined defense contractor (A). All of Applicant\u2019s formal \neducation, including elementary, high school, and college, was received in Iraq. He \nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984. In 1985, during the Iran\u2013Iraq War, Applicant was \ndrafted into the Iraqi Army for the required compulsory military service. Although he was \nwounded in combat in 1987, he remained on active duty in a non-combat role until he \nwas medically discharged as a 1st lieutenant in 1992. He has never served as a member \nof the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance. \n \nAs a linguist, in 2008, Applicant emigrated from Iraq to the United States under the \nSpecial Immigrant Visa for Iraqi Translators Program. He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in 2014.3 In his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he had renounced his Iraqi citizenship:4 \n                                                          \n12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for \nadministrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources \nfrom the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous \ndocuments). In this instance, although Department Counsel has selected only certain facts appearing in \nthe identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered the publications \nin their entirety. \n \n3 The oath of citizenship is as follows: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance \nand fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have \nheretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and \nlaws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United \nStates when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed \nForces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national \nimportance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God. \n \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-united-\nstates-america \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \nI willingly renounce any and all allegiance to previous country of citizenship, \nsurrender my active/expired passport(s) and pledge my loyalty exclusively \nto the United States of America. I take these actions to demonstrate my \nloyalty to the United States and my responsibility to protect sensitive \ninformation and those sensitive circumstances that I may encounter as I \ncarry out my duties and responsibilities to the United States of America. \n \nApplicant was married in 1988. In 2009, Applicant\u2019s wife and their children joined \nApplicant in the United States. He and his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, have three \nchildren: his oldest daughter, born in 1990, is in her second year of medical school at a \nU.S. university, and is a naturalized U.S. citizen; his son, born in 1991, graduated from a \nU.S. university with an engineering degree, and works for a municipal utility in the United \nStates, and is a U.S. Green Card holder;5 and his youngest daughter graduates this year \nas a civil engineer and geologist from a U.S. university, and is a naturalized U.S. citizen. \n \nForeign Influence6 \n \nAs noted above, Applicant was born, raised, educated, and worked in Iraq. His \nfather, now deceased, was an Iraqi-born clerk, and his mother, also deceased, was an \nIraqi-born housewife. They had six children, including Applicant. Applicant\u2019s three, as \nopposed to the alleged four, brothers are Iraqi-born citizens and residents. One brother \nis a self-employed steelworker; one is an accountant with the Iraqi Government; and the \nother is a retired enlisted man with the Iraq military. Applicant\u2019s two sisters are also Iraqi-\nborn citizens and residents. One is a teacher and the other is a housewife. None of \nApplicant\u2019s siblings was ever associated with the Iraqi intelligence service. As of August \n2017, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings varied. He generally spoke to his sisters by \ntelephone on a monthly to quarterly basis. He last spoke to one brother in May 2018, but \nhad not had any contact with his other two brothers in about a year. In early 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his brothers became strained following a falling out when \nthey demanded Applicant\u2019s financial support, something Applicant declined. As a result, \nhe cut all ties with them.7 Two of Applicant\u2019s brothers are married to Iraqi-born wives, both \nof whom are teachers. Applicant initially spoke with them when he spoke with his brothers, \nbut communication with them now is much more limited. \n                                                          \n4 Item 2 (e-QIP, dated August 1, 2017), at 8-9. \n \n5 A Green Card holder (permanent resident) is someone who has been granted authorization to \nlive and work in the United States on a permanent basis. As proof of that status, U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services (USCIS) grants a person a permanent resident card, commonly called a \"Green \nCard.\" \n \n6 General source information pertaining to the foreign influence issues discussed below can be \nfound in the following exhibits: Item 2, supra note 3; Item 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated August 24, \n2017); Item 4 (Developed Relatives and Associates, dated August 7, 2017); Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, \ndated November 12, 2018); AE C (Statement, undated); AE E (Sales Contract, dated February 20, 2018); \nAE F (Typewritten format of Item 4).  \n \n7 Response to the FORM, undated. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nAfter Applicant completed his military service, and started receiving a monthly \nmilitary pension of approximately $320, he worked in a number of different entrepreneurial \njobs ranging from driving a taxi, selling hand-woven rugs, to running a chicken farm. By \nthe mid-1990s, he managed to save enough money to purchase a house in Iraq for \napproximately $4,000. After the United States invaded Iraq, his military-subsidized \nchicken-farm income plummeted with the collapse of the Iraqi Army, so Applicant \nsearched for another job. He finally obtained a position as an interpreter for the U.S. \nmilitary, initially out of desperation to make money despite the dangerous nature of the \njob. Because it was considered an extremely dangerous job, Applicant had to keep his \njob a secret from all but his closest family members. Applicant described his experience \nas follows:8  \n \n. . . as I got to know the fine men and women of our military, it became a \ncalling. I was inspired by their dedication for their country and their desire \nto do good. They served their country with honor and deserved all the \nadmiration that I could give them. \n \nUpon immigrating to the United States, Applicant briefly resided first with a former \nU.S. colleague in Baghdad \u2013 and then with the family who had been sponsoring \nApplicant\u2019s son as an exchange student. He went back to Iraq briefly in 2009, and \nreturned to the United States with his wife and other children. He rented his house in Iraq \nto family members for $400 per month. He went through periods of unemployment in the \nUnited States, and he eventually became a taxi driver, before being able to, once again, \nbecome a linguist. The rental money and his military pension provided some continuing \nincome for him that was sufficient for him to place a down payment for the family \nresidence in the United States. Applicant sold his Iraqi house for approximately \n183,000,000 Iraqi Dinars in February 2018, and he used the funds to pay off his mortgage \non his residence in the United States.9 When he severed all ties with his brothers, his \nmilitary pension, which had been obtained on his behalf by one of his brothers, stopped \nbeing sent to him.10 Applicant no longer has any financial interests in, or coming from, \nIraq.  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States was expressed, as follows:11 \n \nThe United States took me and my family in, gave us safety, opportunity, \nand the greatest honor of citizenship.

My allegiance for my \ncountry is paramount and unwavering. \n                                                          \n8 AE C, supra note 6. \n \n9 AE E, supra note 6; Response to the FORM, supra note 7. \n \n10 Response to the FORM, supra note 7. \n \n11 AE C, supra note 6. \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n \nHe subsequently added:12 \n \n. . . . I would like to mention that I understand I left behind blood relatives in \nIraq, however, the only people I care about are with me in [the United States] \nnot in Iraq. When I took the citizenship oath, I swore an unwavering \nallegiance to the United States, and this will not change under any \ncircumstances. \n \nIraq \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The outcome of the 2014 \nparliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair elections \nand led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi. \n \nIn August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait and declared its annexation into \nIraq. Despite United Nations (UN) disapproval of the action, Iraq refused to withdraw from \nKuwait. In January 1991, a coalition of nations, led by the United States, launched military \noperations against Iraq, called Operation Desert Storm. The Iraqi Army was crushed. No-\nfly zones were established in Iraq, banning Iraq from using all aircraft in the designated \nno-fly zones. After several years of Iraqi non-compliance with established UN resolutions \nand requirements, in March 2003, the United States and another coalition of nations \nlaunched another assault on Iraq, called Operation Iraqi Freedom. Some military \noperations ceased in May 2003, and a provisional government under a governing council \nand an American Chief Civilian Administrator was established to decide all Iraqi affairs. \nOver the ensuing years, hostilities and terrorism continued, and U.S. military operations \nincreased. In 2003, outlawed mid-level and lower level officials of the Ba\u2019ath Party were \npermitted to return to their previous posts. By late 2010, over 90,000 U.S. troops were \nwithdrawn from Iraq, leaving only a transitional military force to advise and assist security \nforces, counterterrorism missions, and protect U.S. civilians. \n \nThe U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with \nIraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked \na milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and \nself-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the U.S. in the region as well as a voice \nof moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning government \ninstitutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly constructive role in \nthe region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass pre-Saddam \nproduction levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains vigorous and \nbroad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues in \naccordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA). \n  \n                                                          \n \n12 Response to the FORM, supra note 7. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nThe SFA between Iraq and the U.S. provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral \nrelationship. It covers the range of bilateral issues including political relations and \ndiplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement \nissues, services, science, culture, education, and environment. Efforts to implement the \nSFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination \nCommittees, which meet periodically.  \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current travel \nadvisory level is Level 4: \u201cDo not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.\u201d The \nU.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. Government \npersonnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict \nsecurity guidelines.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by improvised explosive devices (IED) occur in many areas of the country, \nincluding Baghdad. Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators \n(EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed \non or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire \nweapons. Such attacks may take place in public venues such as cafes and markets. \n  \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL). In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest \nterrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number \nof foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically \neroded in the past two years. According to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for \nIraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than \n12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from \nISIL, drastically reducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Nevertheless, anti-\nAmerican/anti-western sentiment exists throughout Iraq. Human rights violations continue \nto be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other abuses being made against \nthe Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces. \n  \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces \nkilling, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the overwhelming \nmajority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly \nShia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic minorities; \nwomen; and children.  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due \nto violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking \nin persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, \ntransgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and \nlimitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and Iraq \ngovernment problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraq Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nWhile most of the official U.S. commentary regarding Iraq focuses on human rights \nviolations and terrorist activities, there is little, if any, evidence that Iraq is an active \nparticipant in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violator \nof export-control regulations. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d13 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d14   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \n                                                          \n13 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n14 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d15 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.16  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d17 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d18 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n                                                          \n15 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern under the Foreign Influence guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \nThe SOR focused on Applicant\u2019s five siblings, and their Iraqi citizenship and \nresidence; two sisters-in-law, and their Iraqi citizenship and residence; his home \nownership in Iraq with an approximate value of $130,000; and his monthly $320 Iraqi \nmilitary pension. Before 2018, Applicant was bound to his family in Iraq by mutual \naffection. In addition to the citizenship and residence issues, the property owned in Iraq, \nand the military pension, other facts of particular note in the Government\u2019s argument in \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nthe FORM are generally as follows: the frequency of contacts that Applicant has with his \nsiblings and sisters-in-law; the presence of Islamist radical groups in Iraq; the increased \nlevels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency in Iraq; significant human rights problems in \nIraq; and the current U.S. Department of State travel advisory level stating: \u201cDo not travel \nto Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.\u201d All of these facts concerning country \nconditions in Iraq demonstrate a potentially heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or \nduress are present due to Applicant\u2019s close ties to family members who reside in Iraq.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d19  \n \nThere are safety issues for residents of Iraq primarily because of terrorists and \nanti-U.S. sectarian militias operating in Iraq. The mere possession of close family ties with \nrelatives or in-laws living in Iraq is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under the foreign \ninfluence guideline. However, if an applicant has such a relationship with even one person \nliving in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of sensitive information.20 These \ntypes of relationships could create a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. Furthermore, as a matter of common sense and \nhuman experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection \nfor, or obligation to, their immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws.21 Because of the SOR allegation associated with Applicant\u2019s two sisters-in-law, the \nin-law presumption concerning foreign influence is relevant here.  \n  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for foreign influence cases, \u201cthe nature of \nthe foreign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence \nand must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d22 Another important \nconsideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with the United States. \nThese factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members \nliving in that country are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement.  \n \n                                                          \n19 See Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd.

Mar. 13, 2017)). \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of Iraq with \nthe United States, and the situation in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationship with any family member living in Iraq does \nnot pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nForeign influence security concerns are not limited to countries hostile to the \nUnited States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d23 Friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security, and we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields.24  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nIraq seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or \nhis family, it would not be wise to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state \nintelligence services, and Iraq, like many countries, has a problem with terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s family in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which Applicant comes to the \nattention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and who would attempt to \nexert coercion upon him.\u201d25 Nevertheless, as noted above, because of the citizenship and \nresidence issues of his family members; the property owned in Iraq; his military pension; \nand the other facts of particular note in the Government\u2019s argument, the issues of potential \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation have been raised, and AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) \napply. Inasmuch as the property in Iraq has been sold, and he is no longer receiving his \nmilitary pension, AG \u00b6 7(f) minimally applies. However, further inquiry is necessary to \ndetermine the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d as well as the application of any mitigating \nconditions. \n                                                          \n23 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n24 See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)). \n \n25 ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAs noted above, since October 2001, when U.S. forces and coalition partners led \nmilitary operations in Afghanistan, there has been first an interim government, essentially \nunder U.S. control by the Chief Civilian Administrator and a governing council, and then \na democratic government in Iraq. Nevertheless, many daunting challenges remained \nlargely because of Islamic terrorists and unfriendly forces continue to assert power and \nintimidation within the country. It is less likely that the Iraqi government would attempt \ncoercive means to obtain sensitive information. The real concern in this instance is not \nthe Iraqi government, but rather the Islamic terrorists and anti-U.S. sectarian militias.  \n \nDepartment Counsel argued that the presence of Islamist radical groups; the \nincreased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency; and human rights problems in \nIraq demonstrate that a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present \ndue to Applicant\u2019s close ties to his siblings and in-laws. Based on their various \nrelationships, and the locations of Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws, there is obviously a \npotential, if not substantial, risk \u2013 a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security \nclearance.  \n \nHowever, that risk is not generated by the Iraqi government, but rather by Islamic \nterrorists striking out against the central Iraq authorities and all foreigners. Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings and in-laws are not unlike members of the U.S. military stationed in Iraq, for they, \ntoo, are potential targets in this war on civilized humanity. The presence of Islamist radical \ngroups and increased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency in Iraq have also been \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \ndescribed for events occurring on September 11, 2001, and more recently in Fort Hood, \nBoston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, and New York City.  \n \nThere are U.S. military forces stationed in Iraq, and Applicant\u2019s continued presence \nthere as a linguist assisting the U.S. forces, while faced with the high-risk dangers \ninvolved there, would be of significant assistance to those U.S. forces in fulfilling their \nmission.26 Such evidence clearly demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing \nto assume a high level of personal risk on behalf of the United States and shows his ties \nand sense of obligation to the United States could be sufficiently strong enough to support \na favorable application of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b).27 \n   \nAs far as Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are concerned, their relationships have \nsubstantially soured over time. As recently as August 2017, Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nsiblings were that he generally spoke to his sisters by telephone on a monthly to quarterly \nbasis; he last spoke to one brother in May 2018; and had not had any contact with his \nother two brothers in about a year. In early 2018, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brothers \nbecame strained following a falling out over financial support. As a result, he cut all ties \nwith them. Two of Applicant\u2019s brothers are married to Iraqi-born wives, both of whom are \nteachers. Applicant initially spoke with them when he spoke with his brothers, but \ncommunication with them now is much more limited. Applicant clearly acknowledged: \u201cI \nunderstand I left behind blood relatives in Iraq, however, the only people I care about are \nwith me in [the United States] not in Iraq. . . . I swore an unwavering allegiance to the \nUnited States, and this will not change under any circumstances.\u201d  \n \nFurthermore, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s siblings and in-laws are or have \never been political activists, challenging the policies of the Iraqi government; that terrorists \nhave approached or threatened them for any reason; that the Iraqi government or any \nterrorist organization have approached them; or that they currently engage in activities \n                                                          \n26 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd.

As such, there is a reduced possibility that they \nwould be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Iraqi government or the terrorists, \nwhich may seek to quiet those who speak out against them. Under these circumstances, \nthe potential heightened risk created by their residence in Iraq is greatly diminished. \nUnder the developed evidence, it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States. \n \nApplicant has substantial connections to the United States, having lived in the \nUnited States for over a decade. His wife and two of his children are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens residing in the United States. Two of the three children have university degrees, \nwith one of them in her second year of medical school, His third child is in her final \nsemester of a U.S. university. He owns a residence in the United States.  \n \nApplicant no longer owns a residence in Iraq, having sold it in 2018 after it had \nbeen for sale for some time. Furthermore, since his falling out with his brothers, he no \nlonger receives the Iraqi military pension. But, even if he were still receiving that pension, \nit is  highly unlikely that $320 a month would result in a conflict that could be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure him. Applicant has met his burden of \nshowing there is little likelihood that relationships with his siblings and in-laws could create \na risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Furthermore, considering what he previously \nsaid about the United States (\u201cSeeing [his children] grow, prosper, and journey \nsuccessfully towards their American dream make me proud to be an American. My \nallegiance for my country is paramount and unwavering;\u201d and \u201cWhen I took the citizenship \noath, I swore an unwavering allegiance to the United States, and this will not change \nunder any circumstances.\u201d); as well as his professional activities as a linguist for U.S. \nforces in Iraq, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast \nand undivided, and that he has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(f) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n16 \n                                      \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.28       \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation, because his three \nbrothers, two sisters, and two sisters-in-law are Iraqi citizen-residents, they are at risk from \nIslamic terrorists and anti-U.S. sectarian militias operating in Iraq. The Iraqi government \ndoes not fully comply with the rule of law or protect civil liberties in many instances. A \nformer 1st Lieutenant in the Iraqi Army, he was medically discharged, and he received a \nmonthly military pension of $320.  \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as a linguist \nwith U.S. forces in Iraq, where he is scheduled to remain until the end of 2019. He \npreviously served in the same capacity during a period of increased hostilities and military \naction, and he contributed to the missions of the United States at personal risk on behalf \nof U.S. combat forces in Iraq. The United States and Iraqi governments are allies in the war \non terrorism. Applicant has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States. \nHis past and current honorable service as a linguist weighs heavily towards mitigating the \nforeign influence security concerns. These circumstances increase the probability that \nApplicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist \ngroup, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him.29 Furthermore, he is no longer close \nto his family members who reside in Iraq; he no longer owns a house in Iraq; and he no \nlonger receives his military pension.  \n \nMoreover, while the \u201cheightened risk\u201d of terrorist activities occurring in Iraq are also \nactive in the United States, creating a \u201cheightened risk\u201d here as well. With his wife and \nchildren residing in the United States, there is a reduced \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Under the evidence \npresented, I have no questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) through AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n28 See U.S. v.

Gregorian, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  I deny Applicant\u2019s clearance.\n1\nOn 22 October 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the\n2\nSOR, requesting a decision without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA). The record in this case closed 6 February 2019, when Department\nCounsel stated no objection to Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. DOHA assigned the\ncase to me 1 March 2019.\nConsisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-5, and Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM\n1\n(Response).\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent\nDirective 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017. \n1\n03/14/2019\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, but denied the falsification\nallegation. He is a 53-year-old information technology support specialist employed by a\ndefense contractor since February 2017. He was previously employed in a similar\nposition, at a much higher salary from December 2006 to June 2015, when the\ncompany shut down, and he remained unemployed until February 2017. He received a\n$23,000 lump-sum pension payment from the company. He has not previously held a\nclearance.\nThe SOR alleges, Items 3-5 establish, and Applicant admits 43 delinquent debts\ntotaling over $31,000. The debts comprise 25 delinquent medical bills totaling over\n$17,000, 5 delinquent education loans totaling over $3,000, and 13 delinquent\nconsumer credit accounts totaling nearly $11,000. Applicant\u2019s Response shows that the\nstate educational loan authority obtained a $5,291.89 garnishment order against\nApplicant\u2019s wages in December 2017, which Applicant\u2019s employer began deducting at\nthe end of January 2018.3\nApplicant disclosed no financial problems on his October 2017 clearance\napplication (Item 2), but discussed most of the SOR debts during a May 2018 interview\nwith a Government investigator (Item 3). Applicant acknowledged that the debts were\nhis. He stated that he knew he had extensive problems when he completed the\nclearance application, but claimed that he had no intent to mislead the Government\nbecause he knew the issue would come up during the investigation. However, he also\nstated that he omitted his financial problems from the clearance application because he\nfeared that reporting the debts would jeopardize his getting and keeping the job. Now\nthat he has stable employment, he hopes to have his finances straightened out within\nthe next two years.\nApplicant has been paying some of his medical bills as finances permit. He\noffered a screen shot of some claimed payments (Response), but nothing in the screen\nshot connects the putative payments to any SOR debts. Applicant expects to finish the\ngarnishment payments on his education loan within the next two-to-three months,\nHowever, he does not appear to have been in contact with any of his creditors aside\nfrom the education loan authorities.\nApplicant traces his financial problems to his 20-months\u2019 unemployment, his re-\nemployment at a substantially reduced salary, and his continued medical expenses (not\notherwise explained). However, he has not undertaken any action to contact his\ncreditors to discuss addressing his debts. The only creditor he has documented regular\npayments for obtained a garnishment order to enforce payment. Moreover, most of the\nAt which point the balance owed had grown to $5,298.36. Applicant provided copies of the January, February,\n3\nMarch, and July 2018, and January 2019 creditor statements. The January 2019 statement reflected regular\npayments and a current $896.08 balance. Applicant also provided records from the collection agent for the\nGovernment loans. However, the relationship between the two sets of documents is not established.\n2\n \n\nalleged medical debts are held by two collection agents, and could presumably be\nconsolidated into a repayment plan.\nApplicant has not documented any credit or financial counseling. He provided no\ncurrent budget. He provided no work or character references, and provided no evidence\nof community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case\ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or \ndenial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the\nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, but\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant debt\nwhile he was unemployed, but has undertaken no independent efforts to address those\ndebts after regaining employment in 2017.5\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n19(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \u00a9 a history\n5\nof not meeting financial obligations;\n3\n \n\nThe mitigating factors for financial considerations provide little help to Applicant.\nThese financial difficulties are recent and frequent, and given his decrease in income\ncannot be considered unlikely to recur.  Applicant\u2019s unemployment, underemployment,\n6\nand ongoing medical issues are clearly circumstances beyond his control. However, he\nhas not been responsible in dealing with these debts since becoming re-employed.  It is\n7\nnot that he has not completely resolved his debts. It is that he has not documented any\nefforts to organize his debts or keep his creditors advised of his current situation.\n It may be that Applicant lacks the means currently to do more than he is\npresently doing. That is impossible to know because Applicant did not provide a\nfinancial statement or budget that would show if he had the means to begin to address\nhis debts. The debts are clearly not being resolved.  Moreover, Applicant has\n8\nundertaken no actions on the bulk of his debt that could be construed as a good-faith\neffort to resolve the debts, and repayment by garnishment does not constitute such an\neffort.  \n9\nThe Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt\nalleged in the SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all\ndebts simultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic\nplan to resolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement\nthe plan.  Applicant\u2019s actions do not constitute such a plan. I conclude Guideline F\n10\nagainst Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant was aware of his significant\ndebt, but deliberately chose to omit that fact from his clearance application.  He says\n11\nhe knew the Government would find out about his debts, and so lacked the intent to\nmislead the Government. However, he omitted his debts because he feared he would\nlose, or not get, the job he was being considered for. This hardly improves his position.\nAs a cleared employee, there is a wide variety of adverse information that an applicant\nis required to report to the employer, so the employer can comply with its obligation to\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . ;\n\u00b6 20 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20 (c) person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n8\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n9\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. 21 May 2008).\n10\n\u00b6 16 (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n11\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n4\n \n\nreport the information to the Government, if required. The Government must have\nconfidence that an applicant will self-report so the security significance of the conduct\ncan be assessed, and corrective action taken. Applicant\u2019s conduct here constitutes a\ndeliberate omission or evasiveness inconsistent with the candor required of applicants.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

When Applicant\u2019s father graduated, Applicant was about two or three months old, and his parents moved him and his siblings back to Saudi Arabia. Applicant grew up and was raised in Saudi Arabia. With a desire to return to the United States someday, in 2006, while in high school, Applicant\u2019s father arranged for Applicant to live with a Canadian family in Canada for a while, where he studied English and western culture.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and is not married.  He has a Master\u2019s degree in \nAerospace Engineering, and currently holds the position of Engineer.  Applicant is \napplying for a security clearance in connection with his employment with a defense \ncontractor.  He began working for his current employer in May 2016. \n  \n \nApplicant was born in Mesa, Arizona in March 1989.  He and his family are of \nSaudi Arabian ancestry, and were in the United States because Applicant\u2019s father had \nbeen granted an educational scholarship from an oil company in Saudi Arabia (Saudi \nAramco) to pursue his degree at a University in the United States.  When Applicant\u2019s \nfather graduated, Applicant was about two or three months old, and his parents moved \nhim and his siblings back to Saudi Arabia.  Applicant grew up and was raised in Saudi \nArabia. With a desire to return to the United States someday, in 2006, while in high \nschool, Applicant\u2019s father arranged for Applicant to live with a Canadian family in \nCanada for a while, where he studied English and western culture.  Following that, \nApplicant lived with an American family in North Carolina, where he studied English and \nlearned the American culture.  Applicant then went back to Saudi Arabia and graduated \nfrom high school in 2007.   \n \n \nThat same year, Applicant applied for an educational scholarship in Saudi \nArabia, made available to Saudi Arabian citizens, who are students with good GPA\u2019s; \nand who graduate from high school in Saudi Arabia, to be able to study and pursue his \ncollege degree in the United States.  Applicant was awarded the scholarship and \nattended the same University his father had attended.  When Applicant finished his \nBachelor\u2019s degree in 2012, he applied for a scholarship to obtain his Master\u2019s degree, \nwhich he completed in 2014.  After finishing that, he applied for the Ph.D. program.  \nApplicant completed his first year of the Ph.D. program, and then suspended it, and \n\n \n3 \n \nstarted working for his current employer in 2016.  He has now closed his scholarship \naccount with Saudi Arabia.  If he decides to complete his Ph.D. in the future, he will \nhave to pay for it himself.   \n \n \nApplicant explained that in Saudi Arabia everything is basically owned by the \nGovernment.  They own the oil industry as well as the hospitals.  They also distribute \nmoney earned by the Government back to the people to help them obtain their \neducation.  In total, Applicant received approximately $200,000 in educational funds \nprovided to him from the Saudi Arabian Government scholarship to obtain his \nundergraduate and graduate degrees in the United States between July 2008 and May \n2016.  Applicant states that he has no duty, responsibility or obligation to pay back the \nSaudi Arabian Government for the scholarships.      \n \n \n \nApplicant has a number of family members who are citizens and residents of \nSaudi Arabia.  Applicant\u2019s father, his mother, four of his five brothers, four sisters, four \nbrothers-in-law and three sisters-in-law, and numerous extended family members, \nincluding aunts, uncles, and grandmothers.  They are happy for the Applicant, and \nconsider him lucky to be able to live and work in the United States. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is now retired for eight years, but before that was employed by \nthe state-owned oil company of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Applicant\u2019s mother has \nalways been a housewife.  Applicant calls his parents once or twice every two weeks.  \n(Tr. p. 40.) \n \n \nApplicant has five brothers.  Four of them are citizens and residents of Saudi \nArabia, and one is a dual citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia.  His oldest \nbrother is an accountant.  Another brother is a banker, and two are doctors.  The \nyoungest brother is a middle school or high school student.  Applicant speaks to his \nbrothers by phone about once a month or so.  (Tr. p. 45.)   \n \n \nApplicant has four sisters, all of them are citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia.  \nOne is an English teacher, who is married to an Engineer, who is receiving a \nscholarship from Saudi Aramco (the oil company Applicant\u2019s father used to work for).  \nAnother sister is a dentist.  She is married to a male nurse.  His next sister, recently \ngraduated from school and is looking for a job.  She is currently a child care provider.  \nHer husband is a dentist. Applicant\u2019s youngest sister is still in school, trying to become a \ndoctor.  Her husband is an Engineer.  (Tr. p. 48.)  \n \n \nApplicant currently earns about $89,000 annually, and lives comfortably on that \nsalary.  He has no delinquent debts.  (Tr. p. 55.)  He has about $90,000 in savings in his \npersonal bank account, and about $50,000 in his 401k retirement account.  (Tr. p. 56.) \n \n \nApplicant has received security training from his employer, and is aware of his \nforeign contacts and the possibility of foreign influence.  Applicant has never been \napproached or confronted by anyone seeking to obtain protected information from him \non any level.  He states that he would never reveal any protected information to any \nforeign entity seeking to obtain information under any circumstances.  If he is \n\n \n4 \n \nthreatened with death, or if someone in his family or his friends are threatened with \ndeath, he states that he will never disclose U.S. protected information.  (Tr. p. 58.)  \nApplicant is currently a dual citizen of Saudi Arabia and the United States.  He \nmaintains his Saudi Arabian citizenship because he wants to make sure that he is able \nto pass easily through customs when he travels to Saudi Arabia to see his family.  (Tr. \np. 62.) \n \n \nPerformance Evaluations of the Applicant for 2016, 2017, and 2018, are \nfavorable and reflect that he has always either \u201cmet expectations\u201d or \u201cexceeded \nexpectations\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, and C.) \n \n \nIn assessing the heightened risk created as a result of a security clearance, the \nApplicant\u2019s ties to a hostile country are important.  However, even countries friendly to \nthe United States have attempted to gain unauthorized access to classified information. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, I have taken administrative notice of the \ninformation provided concerning the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia is a \nmonarchy ruled by King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud, who is both head of state and \nhead of government.   The government bases its legitimacy on its interpretation of \nshalia (Islamic Law) and the 1992 Basic Law, which specifies that the rulers of the \ncountry shall be male descendants of the founder, King Abudulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al \nSaud.  The most significant human rights issues include unlawful killings, including \nexecution for other than the most serious offenses and without requisite due process; \ntorture; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of lawyers, human rights activists; and \nantigovernment reformists; political prisoners; arbitrary interference with privacy; \nrestrictions on freedoms of peaceful assembly, association, movement, and religion; \ncitizen\u2019s lack of ability and legal means to choose their government through free and fair \nelections; trafficking in person; violence and official gender discrimination against \nwomen, although new women\u2019s rights initiatives were announced and criminalization of \nsame restrictions on freedoms of expression, including on the internet, and the \ncriminalization of libel; and antigovernment reformists.  The U.S. Department of State \nhas issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory regarding Saudi Arabia advising U.S. travelers to \n\u201cexercise caution\u201d while visiting Saudi Arabia due to terrorism and the threat of missile \nattacks on civilian targets.  Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Saudi \nArabia.  Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, \ntransportations hubs, markets/shopping malls and local government facilities.  (HE.1.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n\n \n5 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference \nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States.  Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \njudgement, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it.  By itself: the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment.  The same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11 including: \n \n(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference. \n \nApplicant maintains his Saudi Arabian passport to be able to travel more \nconveniently to see his parents in Saudi Arabia, and for no other reason. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members include his mother, father, five brothers, four \nsisters, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, cousins, and other extended family, who are \ncitizens and residents of Saudi Arabia.  Based upon the evidence presented, they do \nnot threaten or influence Applicant\u2019s choice of interest as a native-born United States \ncitizen.  Applicant\u2019s contact with them is casual, minimal, and not out of the ordinary.  \nThey have no interest in or knowledge of Applicant\u2019s security clearance or work product.  \nAll of Applicant\u2019s family in Saudi Arabia are either in school or are established \nprofessionals in their own right.  They clearly do not need the Applicant for upward \nmobility or financial support.  Under the particular circumstances here, the risk-benefit \nanalysis is applicable, and this contact does not pose a significant security risk to the \nU.S. government.  There is nothing here that may manipulate or induce the Applicant to \nhelp a foreign person or government in a way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests.  \nAll of Applicant\u2019s assets are in the United States.  He is a proud American-born citizen \nand has worked hard since high school to learn the American culture and its ways in \norder to assimilate into the American lifestyle comfortably.  Applicant feels lucky to be \nan American, and only for the fact that his parents and siblings are of Saudi Arabian \nancestry and reside in Saudi Arabia has this issue even surfaced.  Applicant has not \nsubjected himself to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest from his connection with his family.  However, the evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nThe nature of Applicant\u2019s relationships with his family do not pose a security risk.  \nThere is no conflict of interest.  No one in Applicant\u2019s immediate family has ever been \nthe victim of terrorism in Saudi Arabia.  His family is not disturbed with where Applicant \nlives, what Applicant does, nor do they show any interest in the Applicant or his work.  \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen and his relationship with his family does not result \nin a divided allegiance.  Full mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has been \nestablished in regard to his family members.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines C and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nUnder the particular facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s familial Saudi Arabian \nconnections do not pose a risk to the U.S. government.  Applicant is an intelligent \nAmerican citizen whose only connection with Saudi Arabia at this point in his life is his \nparental upbringing, which occurred from the early age of two months old through high \nschool.  Since then, he has been educated in the United States, and is committed to the \nAmerican culture.  He is now dedicated to living his dream of developing technology for \nthe American government.         \n   \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence security \nconcerns.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Applicant is 34 years old and works as an aerospace engineer for a large corporation \nin support of a federal contract. She obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2007. She \nwas hired by her current employer in April 2008. At that time, she lived in State A. In \nJanuary 2008, she transferred to State B, where her family lives. In 2014, Applicant \ntransferred to State C. (GX 1) \n \n \nIn 2013, while living in State B, Applicant helped her family set up and run a small \nbusiness unrelated to her work as an engineer. Applicant was a named partner in the \nbusiness, which was organized as a Subchapter S corporation. Her role in the business \nwas as a bookkeeper, to include making sure taxes were filed properly. As a named \npartner, she received a modest flow-through income she was required to report on her \npersonal income tax returns along with her full-time income as an engineer. When \nApplicant transferred to State C, she could no longer help with bookkeeping and tax duties \nfor her family\u2019s business. Unfortunately, her family was not very well organized in such \nmatters. This impacted Applicant\u2019s ability to file her income tax returns for 2014 and 2015 \nbecause she could not obtain the paperwork needed to correctly file her personal tax \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nreturns. This circumstance continued through the 2015 tax year, when the business \nclosed. (GX 2; Tr. 25 \u2013 29, 32) \n \n \nApplicant has since been able to file her 2014 and 2015 federal and state tax \nreturns. She filed her 2014 return in February 2017 and paid the resulting taxes with \ninterest and penalties at that time. She was unable to file her 2015 returns until November \n2018. She owes $14,607 for federal taxes and $2,300 for state taxes from 2015. Applicant \nhas sufficient funds in her retirement savings with which to satisfy both accounts; \nhowever, she is waiting to hear from the IRS and State C tax authority regarding \nrepayment options before she decides how to resolve her 2015 taxes. Her income and \npersonal finances are otherwise sound, and she has sufficient resources to satisfy any \nreasonable repayment plan. (AX A \u2013 D; Tr. 29 \u2013 30, 33 \u2013 35) \n \n \nThe record does not reflect any other financial problems. Applicant has been \nworking to resolve her late filing status since well before the SOR was issued, and \notherwise has always filed her income tax returns as required. (GX 2) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,2 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n                                                 \n2 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nApplicant did not file her federal and state income tax returns on time for the 2014 \nand 2015 tax years. This information reasonably raised a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n                                                 \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying \ncondition at AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely comply with her tax obligations arose through no fault \nof her own. She was unable to file on time for 2014 and 2015 because she did not yet \nhave the requisite information to complete her tax returns. Applicant has since filed her \n2014 and 2015 returns. She paid all of the taxes due from 2014, but she has not \ncompleted arrangements for paying about $16,000 in federal and state taxes from 2015. \nApplicant has the resources with which to resolve those accounts. She will either make \nlump sum payments using retirement savings or negotiate a monthly repayment plan, \nchoosing whichever option makes the most financial sense. Finally, aside from the 2014 \nand 2015 tax years, Applicant has always and timely fulfilled her income tax reporting and \npayment obligations. All of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 \nmitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised in the SOR. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been working to resolve her unfiled returns since well before \nthe SOR was issued, and the facts established in SOR 1.a were an aberration. Applicant \nwas candid and straightforward about her late tax returns, and her conduct in this regard \ndoes not adversely reflect on her overall judgment and reliability. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the record evidence as a whole shows the security concerns about her \nfinances are mitigated. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nOn August 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant timely answered the SOR and elected to have her case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on September 27, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on October 9, 2018, \nand had 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and she provided a \none-page response to the FORM dated October 24, 2018, and attachments including: a \ndebt-management agreement with a credit-counseling company requiring a first \npayment of $205 in November 2018; income and expense information; and a university \ntranscript. The Government\u2019s evidence, identified as Items 1 through 6, and the FORM \nresponse are admitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me \non January 17, 2019.  \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. She obtained her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010 and she is \ncurrently enrolled online in a master\u2019s program in criminal justice. She has been \nemployed as a detective on the campus police force of a prominent college since May \n2015, and as a federal contractor since 2011. She reported no military service and she \nwas divorced in 2011 after seven years of marriage. She has no children. Her former \nhusband handled all of their finances. They were compelled to file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy protection in 2008 because Applicant suffered serious health problems. \nApplicant reported no previous security clearance. She answered all of the financial \nquestions in section 26 (Financial Record) of her security clearance application (SCA) \nnegatively, failing to disclose her delinquent student loans and medical debts.    \n \nThe SOR alleges the 2008 bankruptcy, five debts for overdue student loans, and \neight delinquencies for medical debts. The delinquent debts alleged total $43,306 \nincluding $38,989 for past-due student loans placed for collection. Applicant admitted all \nof the SOR allegations in her answer to the SOR on September 10, 2018, and she \nprovided a one-page explanation. She explained that they were advised to file \nbankruptcy for their small business once Applicant became ill in 2007-2008. She was \nenrolled in a master\u2019s program in September 2018 and stated her intention to contact \nthe Department of Education about her financial aid and a repayment plan. She also \nclaimed she committed funds to take care of her medical debts and she would start the \nprocess on September 10, 2018. No documentary evidence was provided to show her \nprogress, if any.    \n \nIn her April 2018 personal subject interview (PSI) with a clearance investigator, \nApplicant stated that she thought she was entering into a one year contract with the \nfitness company creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.o, but the employee signed her up for three years \ninstead. (Item 5) Applicant stated her plan to contact this creditor to set up a payment \nplan and finish paying this debt off. No documentary evidence of follow-through was \nprovided to show that she did this. With respect to her student loan debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.c., 1.d, 1.m, and 1.n, Applicant told the clearance investigator that they became \ndelinquent because her former husband said he would take care of paying them. She \nclaimed to be in the process of setting up a payment plan to resolve these debts, but \nprovided no evidence of a track record or stream of payments on her student loans.    \n \nApplicant has a health condition that requires her to travel to a specialized \nhospital for care. This has been a burden financially, and she is unable to make \npayments timely on a single income. (Item 5) Again, she stated her plan to set up a \nrepayment plan for the resulting delinquent medical debts listed in the SOR. In late \n2018, Applicant entered into a debt-management agreement (attached to FORM \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s April 18, 2017 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) (Item 3), or her personal security interview (PSI) on April 20, 2018. \n(Item 5)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nresponse) but provided no evidence of actual payments pursuant to that plan. She also \nprovided budget information and evidence of financial counseling in late 2018. Her loan \nrehabilitation, income and expense information shows her monthly income of $2,883 \ncompared to expenses of $2,110 in October 2018. (FORM Response) The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are all corroborated by her credit reports. (Items 4 and 6) She \nhas no automobile loans or credit-card debts.  \n \nApplicant grew up as a military dependent of a senior officer, and she has been a \nsworn police officer in Commonwealth A since 2010. She provided no character \nreferences or performance evaluations. Applicant attached a college transcript to her \nFORM response showing that she maintains a 3.8 grade point average in her master\u2019s \nprogram. She produced evidence that she has taken the first step by entering into a \ndebt-management plan to resolve her numerous student loans and medical debts, but \nshe has provided no evidence of compliance or actual payments. It is unclear whether \nany of her SOR debts have been paid or disputed.  \n \n                                                              Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines recognize the complexities of human behavior, and are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period \nand a careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an \naffirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2008 bankruptcy and the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are \nconfirmed by her credit reports and answer to the SOR. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to support the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and \n19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.2 Applicant has not met that burden.   \n \n         The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant endured a divorce, and a life-threatening illness. These conditions were \nbeyond her control. Yet, despite her knowledge almost a year ago that her \ndelinquencies might affect her eligibility for a security clearance when she had her \nclearance interview, she has done very little to resolve these delinquent accounts. She \nalso stated her intention to make payment arrangements during her clearance interview. \nShe has produced no relevant or responsive documentation either with her answer to \nthe SOR, or in response to the FORM, except for the debt management agreement and \nattendant documents. This was too little, too late. She has not demonstrated that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. These delinquent debts are longstanding \nfrom her college days, and continuing. She had previous financial distress when she \nfiled for bankruptcy protection in 2008. Applicant has the burden to provide sufficient \n                                                          \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nevidence to show that her financial problems are under control, and that her debts were \nincurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. She admitted her delinquent \nmedical debts and student loans and her credit reports confirm these debts. Applicant \ndid not provide enough details with documentary corroboration about what she did to \naddress her SOR debts. She did not provide documentation relating to any of the SOR \ndebts: (1) proof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of \nchecks, or a letter from the creditor proving that she paid or made any payments to the \ncreditors; (2) correspondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of \ncontact;3 (3) credible debt disputes indicating she did not believe she was responsible \nfor the debts and why she held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate \npayment plans, such as settlement offers or agreements to show that she was \nattempting to resolve these debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for \nher to provide corroborating or supporting documentation of resolution of the debt in the \nSOR. (FORM at 3) Aside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements of intent, there is \nno documentary evidence that Applicant paid, settled, compromised, or otherwise \nresolved the SOR debts. She did provide evidence of recent financial counseling and \ninformation about her budget. Yet, the record lacks corroborating or substantiating \ndocumentation such as receipts or bank statements showing an actual stream of \npayments and detailed explanations of the causes for her financial problems and other \nmitigating information.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n                                                          \n3 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or his] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has struggled to overcome a \nserious health condition and she served as a sworn law enforcement officer for almost \nnine years. She is continuing her education online and she made initial overtures toward \nresolving her financial problems. Most importantly, Applicant has not addressed the \nspecific allegations in the SOR with concrete documentation. Instead, she has made \nhollow statements of her intent to repay her delinquent debts. She has not met her \nburden of production.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. She has not met her \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.o:               \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 8, 2017. \nOn September 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 3, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \nnotice of hearing on May 16, 2019, and the hearing was convened on June 4, 2019. \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 with an exhibit list were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. A department counsel discovery letter was marked as HE 1 and \nappended to the record. Applicant testified at the hearing. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit any documentary evidence in mitigation. He submitted an e-mail \nnarrative, and several receipts, statements and copies of money orders, on June 25, \n2019. These exhibits were marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted into \nevidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on June 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old security officer for a defense contractor, employed since \n2014. He is also a part-time military police officer in the Army National Guard.  Applicant \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree in 2017, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018, and is currently \nattending school for a graduate degree. He was previously married for six months. He \nremarried in 2008 and does not have children. He honorably served on active duty in the \nU.S. Army from 1982 to 1992, and in the Army National Guard from 2006 to present. He \ndeployed to Kosovo for one year while in the National Guard. He currently has a security \nclearance.  \n \nIn December 2009, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. It was \ndischarged in March 2010. In November 2010, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was \nsuspended and an SOR was issued alleging under Guidelines F and E for two financial \njudgments, delinquent and charged-off credit accounts, and for failure to respond to \ngovernment inquiries regarding the bankruptcy and the status of delinquent debts. In \nDecember 2010, a final clearance was granted with a \u201cwarning notice\u201d that subsequent \nunfavorable information may result in the suspension of his security clearance. \n \n \nThe current SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted to the state \nfor a tax lien for about $10,417; a medical account for about $4,610; and four collection \naccounts totaling about $998; a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged in 2010; and under \nGuideline E for failure to report financial delinquencies on his 2017 SCA, and for \nreceiving unemployment benefits from the state, knowing that he was not entitled to \nthem. Applicant admitted the two large debts, one small debt, the 2010 bankruptcy, and \nthe SCA falsification and unemployment benefits allegations, with explanations. He \ndenied three small debts listed as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.e, with explanations.  \n \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.a (state lien), Applicant explained that the lien resulted from \nhim receiving unemployment benefits for which he was not entitled to receive. From \n2010 to 2013, Applicant worked full time as a counselor for a company. (GE 1) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, he claimed that he worked part time, and collected unemployment \nbenefits so that he could \u201cmake ends meet\u201d and buy and repair a trailer house that was \nin \u201cbad shape.\u201d (Answer) The state obtained a judgment against him for about $10,417, \nand Applicant claimed he forfeited about $4,000 in tax refunds that were applied toward \nthe debt. He also testified that in mid-2017, he agreed to pay $160 per month toward \nthe debt to avoid a garnishment of his pay, but that he missed two to three payments \nsince then. Applicant testified that he was unsure how much he owed on the debt, or \n\n \n3 \n \nhow much he has paid to date. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided a \nreceipt showing a payment of $163 on June 10, 2019, but no other documents were \nprovided to show the current status of the debt or payment history. Applicant did not list \nthis lien on his 2017 SCA or his other financial delinquencies because if he had, he \nwould lose his clearance. (Tr. 51-52) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a medical debt for $4,610 that is in collection. Applicant testified \nthat he believed the debt may have been charged off. He did not provide evidence of \nthe resolution of the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.c is a finance company debt for $442 that was \nplaced for collection. Applicant testified that he has been paying about $15 per month in \na garnishment from his pay, and believes the debt has been satisfied, but he was not \nsure. He did not provide evidence of the garnishment payment history or the current \nstatus of the debt. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are medical debts in collection by a collection \ncompany. In testimony, Applicant claimed that he could not inquire about these debts \nbecause he could not find the phone number for the collection agent. SOR \u00b6 1.e is a \ncollection account for $147. In his Answer, Applicant claimed he would satisfy this debt, \nbut he has not provided evidence of such. \n \nIn testimony, Applicant admitted that he had not paid his 2018 Federal income \ntaxes as required. He indicated that as a result of a vehicle repossession, he received a \ncancellation of debt (1099-C) notice that unexpectedly raised his income tax liability that \nhe was unable to pay when he filed his income tax return. In his post-hearing \nsubmission, he provided a copy of a June 2019 cashier\u2019s check to the \u201cDepartment of \nthe Treasury\u201d for $1,549, to satisfy the debt. Applicant did not provide the IRS notice of \ndebt or other government document to show satisfaction of the debt. Applicant also \nadmitted that he owed on school loans, but was unsure of how much, other to say \nmaybe $35,000, but that they were in deferment. Of note, he indicated that current \nschool loan disbursements would be used to pay non-school related debts, leaving it \nunclear how his tuition payments will be made. \n \nApplicant failed to report his delinquent debts and state lien on his 2017 SCA. \nWhen the investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) asked \nApplicant about any debts during his interview, Applicant again claimed he had nothing \nto report. When confronted with the SOR debts, past Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and tax \nlien, Applicant explained that he knew of the debts and discussed the efforts he was \ntaking to resolve them. (GE 2) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had \nfiled bankruptcy, had two vehicles repossessed, was paying on the state debt, and that \nhe knew of credit card debts but thought they were charged off or paid. (Answer) \nApplicant also admitted that he intentionally took state unemployment benefits for which \nhe was not entitled to receive. He received benefits despite being employed, because \nhe needed the money. (GE 2) \n \nIn testimony, Applicant stated that he was delinquent on credit card debts that \nwere not listed in the SOR because of other financial obligations. He was unsure how \nmuch he owed, but in his post-hearing submission, he provided evidence of \napproximately $2,200 in credit card accounts, and one with statements listing it as \n\n \n4 \n \n\u201cseverely past due.\u201d He was forced to use a credit card to fund a vehicle repair, but he is \ngiving his other credit card to his mother for safekeeping or will shred it, so that he \nwould not be tempted to use it. He also testified that he was behind on rent, utilities and \ncredit card payments, but showed payments toward those debts in his post-hearing \nsubmission.  \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had about $205 in checking and savings \naccounts, and that his spouse is working part-time and helps with family expenses. He \nused a credit repair company in February or March 2019 to aid him with his debts, but \nthey only sent letters to creditors and did not make any payments on his behalf. \nApplicant stated in his OPM interview that his debts resulted from living outside of his \nmeans, unexpected expenses to repair his trailer home, and his spouse\u2019s propensity for \nonline shopping. Applicant hoped to receive an advance on his inheritance from his \nmother and use student loan disbursements to pay his debts and expenses. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n\n \n5 \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a) and (c). \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances have been neglected for many years, resulting in a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2010, with a continuation of debt accumulation and an inability to satisfy \ndebts. Applicant has not submitted sufficient evidence to mitigate the SOR debts or to \nshow that his financial problems are under control and will not recur. Applicant\u2019s behavior \ncasts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant admitted his own lack of financial stability and lives paycheck-to- \npaycheck while attending school for a graduate degree. His income appears to be \ninsufficient to meet his financial obligations, and he does not have a reasonable plan to \npay delinquent debts or to prevent further indebtedness. Overall, Applicant\u2019s financial \nstatus raises significant doubts about his financial management decisions and personal \nfinancial responsibility. He is unable to meet current financial needs and cannot pay past \ndebts with his current family income. He borrows from credit cards and student loans to \nmeet life expenses and pay toward his most recent debts, not to mention his SOR debts. \nIn addition, Applicant owes the state for improperly claiming unemployment benefits that \nhe was not entitled to receive. I am not convinced Applicant is financially responsible or \nmakes good financial decisions, and he has not resolved the SOR debts. No mitigation \nfully applies. \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as here, the Government has the \nburden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. (See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)) An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010)) \n \n  \nApplicant intentionally failed to report his delinquent debts on his SCA, as required, \nlargely because he was concerned about the effect on his security clearance. He also \nwrongfully and intentionally claimed substantial state unemployment benefits for which \nhe was not entitled to receive, and intentionally withheld his employment status to the \nstate to continue to wrongfully receive benefits. There is sufficient evidence that Applicant \nknew of the delinquent debts and state lien, and that he knowingly omitted them from his \nSCA. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n8 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s omissions from his SCA were knowing and intentional, and he made \nno effort to acknowledge the error when confronted by an OPM investigator. He also \nknowingly and willfully received state benefits to which he was not entitled. Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior casts significant doubt on his trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. No \nmitigating condition fully applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E, in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service, recent efforts to pay toward current debts, and monthly \npayments toward his state debt. However, besides the unresolved SOR debts, I find \nApplicant\u2019s intentionally claiming unemployment benefits from the state when he was not \nentitled to them, is particularly egregious. I remain unconvinced of his trustworthiness, \nfinancial responsibility, and ability and willingness to meet his financial obligations. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His SOR admission, and those at the hearing, are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including his testimony and demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 48-year-old owner and president of a corporation doing business with the federal government. He graduated from high school in 1989, and completed some college work, but did not earn a degree. He married in 1990 and divorced in 1998. He has two adult children of this marriage. He remarried in 2005, and he has two children of this marriage. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. military in 1989 and served honorably until his discharge in 1998. He has held a clearance, for the most part, continuously since 1989. There is no evidence of any issues of security concern, except for those alleged in the SOR. In his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that his eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was revoked by another federal agency (Agency) in April 2017. Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed the circumstances that led to the revocation of his SCI eligibility that is documented in GE 2 through GE 8.

Applicant answered the SOR \non October 23, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \n \nDOHA assigned the case to me on January 16, 2019, and issued a notice of \nhearing on May 1, 2019, setting the hearing for May 17, 2019. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered nine exhibits (GE 1 through 9). Applicant testified, and submitted \ntwo exhibits post-hearing (AE 1 and 2). All exhibits were admitted without objection, \nexcept for GE 2. Applicant objected to GE 2 - an unauthenticated summary of \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s January 2018 interview with a government investigator. Consistent with \nEnclosure 3, Paragraph E3.1.20 of DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive) and DOHA Appeal Board precedent, I \nsustained the objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a. He denied all of the remaining \nSOR allegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.e). His SOR admission, and those at the hearing, are \nincorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, \nincluding his testimony and demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old owner and president of a corporation doing business \nwith the federal government. He graduated from high school in 1989, and completed \nsome college work, but did not earn a degree. He married in 1990 and divorced in 1998. \nHe has two adult children of this marriage. He remarried in 2005, and he has two \nchildren of this marriage.  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the U.S. military in 1989 and served honorably until his \ndischarge in 1998. He has held a clearance, for the most part, continuously since 1989. \nThere is no evidence of any issues of security concern, except for those alleged in the \nSOR. \n \nIn his 2017 SCA, Applicant disclosed that his eligibility for access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI) was revoked by another federal agency (Agency) in \nApril 2017. Applicant\u2019s background investigation addressed the circumstances that led \nto the revocation of his SCI eligibility that is documented in GE 2 through GE 8. \n \nThe Agency revoked Applicant\u2019s eligibility because of \u201crepeated and recent \ninvolvement in workplace violence\u201d and a 2004 psychological evaluation that raised \nconcerns about his judgment, reliability, and willingness or ability to obey laws, rules, \nand regulations. Specifically, the Agency considered Applicant\u2019s 1989 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and \nDecember 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) physical altercations, a December 2016 road rage incident \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a December 2016 work place physical altercation (SOR \u00b6 1.e).  \n \nIn 1989, when he was 17 and attending high school, Applicant was involved in a \nphysical altercation with a security guard. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The security guard grabbed him \nfrom behind when he was attempting to enter his car, and Applicant threw him against a \ncar. Apparently, the security guard had no legal basis to grab Applicant from behind \nwithout a warning. Applicant was not arrested or charged as a result of the incident. He \ndisclosed this incident in his first SCA in the early 1990s. (GE 4) \n \n \nIn December 2001, Applicant was involved in a physical altercation with the \nsecurity system administrator for the company he was detailed to work for under \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncontract. He was told he could not bring outside computers into a secured area. \nApplicant was involved in a verbal argument, became angry and made vulgar remarks \nand gestures, bumped chests with the other person, and in his way out, pushed the \ndoor so hard that it damaged the wall. Applicant received a verbal reprimand and was \nwarned that any future incidents would result in his dismissal. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \nAs a result of the above incident, Applicant was required to participate in a \npsychological assessment in April 2004. The psychologist concluded Applicant had \nseveral maladaptive personality traits that appear to be longstanding and inflexible. She \nconcluded Applicant did not have a major mental illness or a substance disorder. \nApplicant was diagnosed with a Personality Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, with \nNarcissistic and Antisocial Features. She determined Applicant was at moderate risk for \nunreliable behavior in the future. In August 2004, Applicant signed a \u201cSpecial Security \nAwareness Acknowledgement\u201d regarding his personal conduct. (GE 3)  \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant was driving his car to or from lunch with co-workers \nin his vehicle. He was cut off by another driver and was involved in a verbal altercation \nand car chase with the occupants of the other vehicle. He exhibited aggressive behavior \ndescribed by some of his co-workers as road rage. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) Applicant admitted parts \nof this allegation. He claimed that he followed the other car to obtain its license plate; \nthat his occupants were never in danger, that there was no police intervention, and that \nthe co-workers in his car have continued to go out to lunch with him. He averred that the \nincident was reported as a concern by the same person with whom he was involved in \nan altercation in 2001. He believes that the individual seeks any opportunity to take \nrevenge against Applicant. \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant also was involved in a physical altercation at the \nwork place while employed as the president of a corporation contracting with the \nGovernment. Applicant admitted the physical altercation, but claimed that he did not \nstart the altercation, and that he was defending himself. He acknowledged that he made \na judgment mistake when he failed to de-escalate the situation. \n \nI note that the Agency made a comprehensive investigation of this incident, \ninterviewing witnesses and co-workers with knowledge of this incident and prior \nincidents or concern regarding Applicant. The general sense derived from reading the \nsummary of the investigation is that Applicant had aggressive tendencies and a volatile \npersonality. Notwithstanding, the witnesses and co-workers opined Applicant could be \ntrusted and relied upon to protect classified information. (GE 3 and 6) \n \nFollowing the last incident in December 2016, Applicant sought psychological \ncounseling in July 2017, to help him learn from his mistakes and overcome the \nproblems he was having. He realized that as the owner of a corporation he needed to \nlearn to professionally manage and supervise his employees without any altercations or \nconfrontations. He now sees his interpersonal skills as pivotal part of his job and his \ncompany\u2019s success.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAfter considering all of the evidence he accumulated during his clinical \nevaluation, as well as that included in the revocation of Applicant\u2019s eligibility by the \nAgency, the psychologist concluded that the evidence failed to demonstrate \u201can \nenduring pattern that would meet the criteria for a Personality Disorder \u2013 NOS.\u201d In his \nopinion, Applicant does not have any indication of mental instability or any other form of \nmental health pathology. \n \nThe psychologist recommended Applicant participate in psycho-educational \ncounseling to help him effectively manage his reactiveness to provocations of others. \nApplicant followed the psychologist\u2019s recommendations and took an online eight-hour \nanger-management course accredited with his state\u2019s court system. Applicant found the \ncourse very helpful to help him understand his assertive personality and its effects on \nothers. It taught him to deal not only with his own anger, but also to recognize and deal \nwith others\u2019 anger so that he can defuse possible violent situations in the future.  \n \nApplicant believes that he has learned a hard lesson as a result of the Agency \nrevocation of his eligibility. He credibly stated that this type of incidents will never \nhappen again. He noted that his online anger-management course was very helpful, but \nwhat made things very clear to him was losing close to $300,000 in two years because \nof his ineligibility for a clearance. Applicant stated: \u201cI know what happened and I'm very \nclear on what happened. I'm very clear of the repercussions of what happened. I'm very \nclear on the repercussions that could happen if it ever happened again.\u201d He has not had \nany additional altercations since the last incident in December 2016. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information . . . .  \n \n \nBetween 1989 and 2016, Applicant was involved in four verbal and physical \naltercations where he exhibited aggressive behavior. The altercations in 2001 and 2016 \nwere physical altercations in the work place. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior raise the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified information or \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nThe record established the above disqualifying condition. The following mitigating \nconditions set forth by AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \n \nApplicant has held a clearance since 1989, with no issues or security concerns, \nexcept for the current SOR allegations. He disclosed the Agency\u2019s revocation of his SCI \neligibility in his 2017 SCA, and he was forthcoming at his hearing. He has established a \ngood reputation for properly handling and securing classified information. \n \n \nThe facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a occurred 30 years ago, when Applicant was 17 \nyears old, immature, and in high school. I find this incident to be dated, and it also \nappears that it was not his fault. The incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b occurred 18 years \nago, but when considered with the two aggressive behavior incidents in 2016, they call \ninto question Applicant\u2019s good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his aggressive behavior and credibly promised not to \nrepeat his questionable behavior. He believes he learned a hard lesson going through \nthe eligibility determination in which the Agency revoked his SCI eligibility because of \nhis aggressive behavior. During the process, Applicant underwent a psychological \nevaluation and received a favorable diagnosis. He also completed anger-management \ncounseling. Applicant considered the anger-management counseling to be very helpful \nfor his managerial responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant is contrite about his past aggressive behavior. He understands that his \nand his corporation\u2019s success depends on his ability to supervise, manage, and \nprofessionally deal with his employees, co-workers, and Government supervisors. I find \nthat Applicant is unlikely to continue his aggressive behavior. The revocation of his SCI \neligibility cost him close to $300,000 in two years. There is no evidence of any additional \nquestionable behavior. I find that Applicant\u2019s past aggressive behavior does not cast \ndoubt in his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The two mitigating \nconditions outline above apply and mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old president and owner of a corporation doing business \nwith the federal government. He honorably served in the military for nine years. He has \nheld a clearance since 1989 without any issues or concerns, except for the SOR current \nallegations.  \n \nApplicant is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his aggressive \nbehavior in the work place. He credibly promised to avoid any future aggressive \nbehavior concerns. I believe that he has learned a hard lesson and will not repeat his \naggressive behavior. The personal conduct security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 1, 2018, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86). On September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nOn September 25, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM), dated October 15, 2018, was provided to him by letter on \nOctober 16, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on October 31, 2018.

(Item 3) He seeks a security clearance in conjunction with his \ncurrent employment.    \nApplicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in May 1996. He married in June 1999, \nand has two minor children. (Item 3) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer accounts totaling $75,963. In his \nSOR Answer, Applicant admits each of the debts. These debts are further established \nby his March 2018 credit report, as well as by his Office of Personnel Management \nPersonal Subject Interview (OPM PSI) conducted in June 2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h.; \nItems 1, 2, 4, 5) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer, he states these debts arose after he used his \npersonal credit cards to fund a start-up company that he created with another individual. \nWhen that individual died unexpectedly in June 2017, the company dissolved. Applicant \nexplained that at the time of his partner\u2019s death, the business was working on a medical \nproduct.

Applicant reported one \ndelinquent debt in his February 2018 SF-86. He described the debt as an \u201cunsecured \ncredit card,\u201d which he estimated at $20,000, and reported this debt was the result of \n\u201creduced income.\u201d He also reported that he was \u201cdiscussing a lump sum payoff with the \ncreditor\u201d and estimated May 2017 as the date the financial issue began. (Item 3)  \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM discussed specific shortcomings of Applicant\u2019s \nSOR answer, and emphasized long-standing DOHA case law concerning the necessity \nfor applicants to provide mitigating documentation. Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer and FORM \nResponse contained no documentation that addressed his SOR debts. \n \n \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(b) \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so.\u201d Based on the evidence \ncontained in the record, AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(b) are applicable. Further review is \nnecessary.   \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially mitigating conditions under these facts: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n  \nThe Appeal Board explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility to prove applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nApplicant has not yet established any of these conditions. Although Applicant \nused his personal credit card to fund his business venture, all of the debts alleged on \nthe SOR are individual credit accounts. The death of his business partner is certainly a \ncircumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control; however, in order for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, \nApplicant must demonstrate that he has acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nBeyond the statement he provides in his SOR answer, the record is unclear when or \nhow Applicant intends to resolve the delinquencies. \n \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed for the \nmajority of his adult life, and he is presumed to be a mature, responsible citizen.  \nNonetheless, without sufficient information, including corroborating documentation, \nsuggesting that his long-standing financial problems are being addressed, doubts \nremain about his suitability for access to classified information. Protection of the national \ninterest is the principal focus of these adjudications. Accordingly, those doubts must be \nresolved against Applicant. \n \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record, but failed to submit sufficient \nevidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts regarding his \ncircumstances, articulate his position, or mitigate the financial security concerns. He \nfailed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation regarding his \nefforts to address his delinquent debt. By failing to provide such information, financial \nconsiderations security concerns remain. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant national security eligibility.

Applicant avers that she \u201cwill work on settling\u201d these past-due debts \nto Creditor Q totaling about $5,832. However, Applicant has offered nothing further in \nthis regard. These allegations are found against Applicant.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has significant tax delinquencies and other past-due debts. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes seven conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nNone of these apply. Although Applicant has made arrangements with the IRS to \npay her tax delinquencies, she has not provided anything showing Applicant is \ncomplying with those arrangements. Financial Considerations are found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n \n \n\n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. She has not met her burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d.~1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i. and 1.j.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. and 1.l.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.n. and 1.r.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor \u201cfor over 14 years.\u201d (TR at page 12 line 20 to page 16 line 16.) He is married, and attributes his alleged financial difficulties to his wife losing her job. (TR at page 30 line 23 to page 31 line 5, and at page 36 lines 1~16.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant admitted a past-due student loan debt to Creditor A in the amount of about $20,388. He mistakenly thought this private student loan, along with his other student loans, was deferred. (TR at page 17 line 4 to page 29 line 20.) This debt \u201chas been settled,\u201d with a current \u201cBalance: $0.00,\u201d as evidenced by correspondence from Creditor A. (AppX B.) This allegation is found for Applicant. 1.b. Applicant admitted past-due auto loan debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $10,013. He mistakenly though this debt was covered by his gap insurance when his vehicle was voluntarily repossessed.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 20, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 8, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 14, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 11, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which \nwere admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left \nopen until April 11, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation.  DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on February 26, 2019. On April 10, 2019, Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \noffered three sets of documents; which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through \nC, and admitted into evidence. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to both allegations of the SOR, \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor \u201cfor over 14 years.\u201d (TR at page 12 line 20 to \npage 16 line 16.) He is married, and attributes his alleged financial difficulties to his wife \nlosing her job. (TR at page 30 line 23 to page 31 line 5, and at page 36 lines 1~16.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admitted a past-due student loan debt to Creditor A in the amount \nof about $20,388. He mistakenly thought this private student loan, along with his other \nstudent loans, was deferred. (TR at page 17 line 4 to page 29 line 20.) This debt \u201chas \nbeen settled,\u201d with a current \u201cBalance: $0.00,\u201d as evidenced by correspondence from \nCreditor A. (AppX B.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admitted past-due auto loan debt to Creditor B in the amount of \nabout $10,013. He mistakenly though this debt was covered by his gap insurance when \nhis vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. (TR at page 30 line 1 to page 35 line 15, and at \npage 39 lines 1~15.) This debt has been settled for $5,000, as evidenced by \ncorrespondence from Creditor B. (AppX C.) Furthermore, this debt does not appear on \nApplicant\u2019s most recent April 2019 credit reports. (AppX A.) This allegation is also found \nfor Applicant. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \n \n  \nApplicant had past-due student loans, that he thought were deferred; and a past-\ndue auto loan, that he thought was covered by gap insurance. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by his spouse losing her job, which \nwas largely beyond his control. He has now addressed both delinquencies, and has \n\n \n5 \n \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The facts are summarized in the \nwritten request and will not be repeated in this decision. However, of particular note, are \nthe following salient facts from HE 1: \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The U.S. State Department warns \nthat U.S. citizens traveling in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist \nviolence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant (ISIL) controlled a significant portion of Iraq\u2019s territory at all relevant times. Within \nareas under ISIL control, the Iraq government has little or no ability to exercise control \nand ensure public safety. Kidnappings and attacks by improvised explosive devices \n\n \n3 \n \n(IED\u2019s) occur frequently in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Such attacks \noften take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.  \n \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies \nthroughout Iraq. Iraq witnessed a continuing surge of terrorist activity in 2016, primarily \nas a result of the actions of ISIL. Although the government of Iraq has made significant \nprogress in its campaign to retake occupied territory from ISIL, there remains a security \nvacuum in parts of Iraq. The U.S. State Department has also reported that ISIL \ncommitted the overwhelming number of significant human rights abuses, including \nattacks against civilians, especially Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL, and women \nand children. ISIL members committed acts of violence on a mass scale, including \nkillings by suicide bombings, IEDs, execution-style shootings, public beheadings, and \nother forms of execution. Sectarian hostility, widespread corruption, and lack of \ntransparency at all levels, weakened the Iraq government\u2019s authority and worsened \neffective human rights protections. \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice - Egypt \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the HE 2 source \ndocuments, and incorporated them by reference. The facts are summarized in the \nwritten request and will not be repeated in this decision. However, of particular note, are \nthe following salient facts from HE 2: \n \nNotwithstanding the long-standing strategic U.S.\u2013Egypt relationship, current \ncountry conditions are problematic.  The U.S. State Department urges citizens to use \ncaution when traveling to Egypt due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist \ngroups have committed multiple deadly attacks in Egypt. The potential for terrorist \nattacks in Egypt, including against U.S. citizens and Western interests, remains a \nconcern. Two Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) affiliates continue to pose a threat. \nEgypt also faced anti-regime violence primarily targeting security personnel. However, \nin November 2017, terrorists killed more than 312 civilians at a Sufi mosque in North \nSinai. Also, significant human rights abuses persist in Egypt. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He was married in 2005 and divorced in 2010. He \nmarried again in December 2013, and he has a two-year-old son. (GE 1, Tr. 28, 35)  \nApplicant was born, raised, and educated in the U.S. He was employed in information \ntechnology by a federal contractor in Iraq from 2004 to 2013. (Tr. 54) He has been \nemployed as a senior contracts administrator for a federal contractor since February \n2017. (Tr. 51) He met his current wife in 2013 while she was working as a contractor for \nthe United States (U.S.) from 2012 to 2014. (Tr. 43) She was born in Egypt and is a \n                                                          \n1 Unless otherwise stated, the basis for these findings of fact is Applicant\u2019s security clearance application \n(SCA) dated April 5, 2017 (GE 1) and the summaries of personal subject interviews conducted on \nJanuary 4, 2018, and April 9, 2018. (GE 2) \n \n\n \n4 \n \ndual citizen of Egypt and Iraq.  Applicant\u2019s foreign-born wife and family present security \nconcerns for him.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 5, 2017.2 In section \n18 (Relatives) and section 19 (Foreign Contacts) of his SCA, he disclosed his wife, her \nparents, and siblings, as dual citizens of Iraq (paternal) and Egypt (maternal) and \ncurrently residing in Egypt. His wife has one sister, age 23, and two brothers, ages 26, \nand 29. (Tr. 13) Although Applicant\u2019s wife and her siblings were born in Egypt, they are \nconsidered dual residents of Egypt and Iraq since their father was an Iraqi. His children \nacquired Iraqi citizenship by default. (Tr. 31-32) In 2001, her entire family moved from \nEgypt to Iraq to be with her father\u2019s extended family. (Tr. 43) They remained in Iraq for \n13 years. After college, Applicant\u2019s wife moved with her family back to Egypt in 2014 \ndue to deteriorating conditions in Iraq. (Tr. 32-33) They maintain no ties to Iraq and \nhave no desire to return to that war-ravaged country. (Tr. 33)    \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that his wife could not find a job in Iraq after obtaining \nher college degree because her mother was an Egyptian and her family were Shia. (Tr. \n33) They faced discrimination in Iraq. She obtained work in the Green Zone in Iraq \nwhere she met Applicant near the U.S. Embassy. Applicant finished his assignment \noverseeing contracts and left Iraq in 2013, but returned a few months later to marry his \nwife in December 2013. (Tr. 35) He waited so there would be no conflict of interest. \nApplicant met her family, whom he described as modern, secular, and non-political. (Tr. \n38) Her parents are elderly and do not speak English. They have no ties to the \ngovernment of Iraq or Egypt. Applicant and his wife moved to the U.S. in 2014. She has \na green card and expects to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen in about one year. (Tr. 38)    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s two brothers were college educated in Baghdad, and her sister \nwas college educated in Egypt. (Tr. 41) His wife and her two brothers all worked on a \nU.S. military installation in Iraq from 2012 to 2014, and all completed questionnaires for \nnational security positions, and were vetted by either the U.S. DOD or U.S. Department \nof State (DOS) to work in Iraq for a major U.S. contractor. (Tr. 21-24) Applicant provided \ncopies of their U.S.-issued security badges allowing access to the installation. (AE \nB,C,E,F) Applicant\u2019s wife was an administrative assistant. Her brother was a network \nadministrator with unfettered access to U.S. computer systems. (Tr. 23-24)    \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n \nApplicant testified credibly that while his wife loves her parents and siblings, his \nrelationship with them is cordial, but not like family. Her parents are elderly and retired. \n(Tr. 46) His wife contacts her parents via an application known as WhatsApp \napproximately every few days. (Tr. 44) She uses the same application to contact her \nsister every two weeks, and her brothers about once a month. (Tr. 45) His wife is a \nhomemaker and mother devoted to her family in the U.S. Her brothers are employed in \ndata processing and telemarketing in Egypt. (Tr. 47) They face prejudice in Egypt \nbecause their father is Iraqi. (Tr. 47) Applicant\u2019s wife last visited her parents in Egypt in \n2015. (Tr. 48) The parents\u2019 apartment there will likely be inherited by her brothers. (Tr. \n49) Nobody in his wife\u2019s family knows what Applicant does for work.    \n                                                          \n2 GE 1. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted AE A, which is a character reference letter for his wife written \nby the senior project manager for a federal contractor. It recognizes her for superior \nperformance, and significant contributions from 2012 to 2013, while assigned to the \nsecurity department of a major U.S. contractor in Iraq. He also submitted a copy of her \nIraqi passport that expired in August 2016. (AE D) Applicant stated that she will never \ngo back to Iraq and will not renew it. (Tr. 22) Applicant also submitted U.S. Department \nof State (DOS) travel advisories showing that Egypt poses the same level 2 (low) risk as \nFrance, Germany, and Mexico, compared to Iraq, which is a level 4 risk. (AE G)  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n(c) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, or pressure, or coercion.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents and her two brothers and sister are dual citizens of Iraq \nand Egypt, and residents of Egypt. She loves her parents and siblings. She provides no \nfinancial support to her parents, but she contacts them regularly, as a dutiful daughter. \nOn rare occasions, Applicant exchanges pleasantries with his in-laws during these \nWhatsApp calls. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts through his wife create a potential conflict \n\n \n7 \n \nof interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, and coercion, both directly and vicariously through her family members. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(c), are implicated by the evidence. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife\u2019s parents and siblings, who are dual citizens of Iraq and Egypt, \nand residents of Egypt, creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \nand  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a long-standing preference for working with and \nsupporting the U.S. He served in harm\u2019s way as a federal contractor for over 11 years \nand directly supported U.S. DOD interests. His wife and her two brothers were also \nvetted and hired as federal contractors in Iraq. They have no affinity for Iraq and are \ndetermined to never return. Their Iraqi citizenship is derived from their Iraqi father. \nHis wife\u2019s family has resided in Egypt for five years. They are not involved in \ngovernment, intelligence gathering, or politics in Egypt. That country is a long-\nstanding ally of the U.S. and it is deemed a level 2 risk by the U.S. Department of \nState, which is akin to the risk level in France, Germany and many other close \nallies. Although he is presumed to have strong bonds of affection with his in-laws in \nEgypt, these bonds are not sufficient to offset or overcome his demonstrated, long-term \ncommitment to the U.S. and self-abnegation in its service under dangerous conditions.3  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \n                                                          \n3 The Appeal Board has held that \u201can Applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the United States \nis very important and can lead to a favorable result for an Applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case \n04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. March 20, 2007). \n\n \n8 \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.4  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S., or \nthe foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant wife\u2019s parents and siblings are dual Iraqi-Egyptian citizens residing in \nEgypt. Although Iraq is an unstable regime, they have no contacts or affection for Iraq. \nEgypt is a low risk. Applicant\u2019s contact with them is infrequent, if ever, by WhatsApp. \nThere is no indication that they are affiliated with the Egyptian government or \nintelligence services. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s foreign family members do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant would \nreport contacts with his relatives by foreign intelligence agents, and that he has a long-\nterm commitment to the U.S. All of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 8 are applicable to \nthe contacts with family members, which are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u20131.d.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline. Applicant is 51 years old. He submitted a character \nreference on behalf of his wife attesting to her allegiance to the U.S. She is applying for \ncitizenship in the U.S. Much of Applicant\u2019s professional life was spent in Iraq supporting \nU.S. interests and he has minimal contact with, and little affection for his in-laws. He is \nvery low risk to ever be influenced by them.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no serious questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n                      Paragraph 1, Guideline B:                         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                             For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n               Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n ________________________ \n \n \n \n \n      Robert J.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 13, 2016. On \nNovember 28, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 2, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 6, \n\n \n2 \n \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. On April 24, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for May 9, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. At Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequest, supplemented by my own motion, I took judicial notice of relevant facts about \nPakistan. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I; HX II; Tr. 8-9.) The facts noticed are set out below in \nmy findings of fact. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX A), which \nwas admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \nand he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d in part. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old program manager employed by defense contractors \nsince February 2009. He manages programs for two U.S. Government agencies. (Tr. \n23-24.) He worked for private-sector employers in the United States from August 2000 \nto February 2009. He has never held a security clearance. \n \nApplicant was born in Pakistan. He came to the United States in August 1995 on \na student visa and obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in August \n2000. He later learned a master\u2019s degree in project management in May 2012. (AX A, \nExhibit 6 at 3-9.)  \n \nApplicant married in February 2003 and has two children, ages 14 and 9. His \nwife was born in Pakistan, came to the United States in 1998 or 1999, became a U.S. \ncitizen, and sponsored Applicant for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 21.) He became a U.S. citizen \nin October 2008. Their children are U.S. citizens. He renounced his Pakistani citizenship \nin April 2017. (AX A, Exhibit 1.) Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of the \nUnited States, and his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Canada. \n \nApplicant and his wife purchased a home in the United States in May 2003 and \nstill live there. They do not own any property or have any financial assets in Pakistan. \nApplicant testified that if he and his two siblings inherit their parents\u2019 home and \ninvestment properties in Pakistan, he would sell his share and bring the proceeds of the \nsale to the United States. (Tr. 29.) The record does not reflect the value of his parents\u2019 \nhome and investment properties. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Pakistan. His mother is not \nemployed outside the home. His father is employed by a company that was formerly \nSaudi-owned but has been privatized for the past four or five years. His father\u2019s \nemployer is an electrical power and construction company. (Tr. 27.) Both of his parents \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nhave green cards issued in April 2015, allowing them to have extended visits in the \nUnited States and to eventually retire in the United States if they choose to. (AX A, \nExhibit 5; Tr. 24-25.) Applicant testified that he previously visited his family members in \nPakistan every two or three years, but he has not traveled to Pakistan for about five \nyears. (Tr. 43.) Applicant\u2019s mother has vision problems and has received treatment in \nthe United States. If she requires additional treatment, Applicant anticipates that she \nand Applicant\u2019s father will retire in the United States as permanent residents, and his \nmother will be able to obtain the treatment she needs. (Tr. 50.) \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers, ages 46 and 44. Applicant\u2019s younger brother is a \ncitizen and resident of Canada. His older brother came to the United States in 1991, \nattended U.S. universities, and was then employed in the United States until 2002, \nwhen he returned to Pakistan. He runs a small weaving and printing business in \nPakistan. He married in Pakistan and has two children, who are U.S. citizens by virtue \nof having been born in the United States. (Tr. 32.) Applicant talks to his older brother \nabout once a week.  \n \n \nApplicant has two paternal uncles who retired from the Pakistani Army as \nbrigadiers. One is 90 years old and retired about 35 years ago; the other is 80 years old \nand retired about 25 years ago. Their children reside in the United States and Canada. \nApplicant\u2019s contact with his uncles is by telephone and infrequent. He last visited them \nin Pakistan in 2015. \n \n \nApplicant has occasional contact with middle-school classmates from Pakistan. \nHe regards one of them as a \u201cgood friend,\u201d and they exchange text messages on social \ntopics once or twice a month. (Tr. 39-40.) \n \n \nPakistan is a federal republic. It experienced election irregularities in May 2013, \nbut elections have otherwise been free and fair. Transitions in the military and judiciary \nhave been orderly. Although terrorist groups in Pakistan have been seriously degraded, \nthey continue to operate from remote locations that historically have been exploited as \nsafe havens. Pakistan suffered numerous terrorist attacks during 2016 and 2017. The \nUnited States suspended security assistance to Pakistan in August 2017, to encourage \nPakistan to prevent militant and terrorist groups from using its territory. The Department \nof State discourages travel to Pakistan due to threats of terrorism. Pakistan\u2019s most \nsignificant \nhuman-rights \nissues \ninclude \nextrajudicial \nand \ntargeted \nkillings, \ndisappearances; torture, lack of rule of law, poor implementation and enforcement of \nlaws, frequent mob violence, and vigilante justice with limited accountability. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n4 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of \nPakistan (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), one of his brothers is a citizen and resident of Pakistan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), and his two paternal uncles are citizens and residents of Pakistan and are \nboth retired generals in the Pakistan military (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The security concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. . . .  Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nAlthough the United States and Pakistan have had disagreements regarding the \nsafe havens for terrorism, Pakistan is generally regarded in the United States as a \nfriendly country. However, Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United \nStates. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. \nMay 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the \neconomic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. In considering the nature of the government, an \nadministrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to \ngrant clearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area \nwhere family members resided). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(f) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. The Applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members in Pakistan and the risk of terrorism are sufficient to establish the \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f) is not established. Although Applicant\u2019s mother has vision problems, \nboth of his parents are otherwise in good health. Applicant\u2019s potential inheritance of \nproperty in Pakistan is speculative and uncertain, both as to the likelihood of it occurring \nand its value. His potential property interests in Pakistan were not alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant, his wife, and his children are citizens and \nresidents of the United States. He has lived in the United States since 1995, worked in \nthe United States since August 2000, completed his education in the United States, \n\n \n7 \n \nowned his residence in the United States since May 2003, and has been a U.S citizen \nsince October 2008. Based on his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe United States, I am confident that Applicant would resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s contacts with his paternal uncles. \nHowever, he has not overcome the rebuttable presumption that his contacts with \nimmediate family members in Pakistan are not casual. See ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, \nsincere, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his foreign \nfamily members in Pakistan. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/05/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 14, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 12, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 16, 2019. The Government offered \n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough R. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and all were admitted into \nevidence. The record was held open until May 15, 2019, to allow Applicant to provide \nadditional exhibits. He submitted AE S through W, which were admitted without \nobjection.1 DOHA received the hearing transcript on April 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6 1.a through 1.e. He denied the \nSOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He graduated from high school in 2005 and enlisted in \nthe military. He served in the military for almost ten years and was honorably discharged \nas a staff sergeant (E-6) in 2015. Applicant deployed to Iraq in 2007 (5 months) and in \n2008-2009 (8 months). He deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 (8 months), 2011-2012 (7 \nmonths), and 2013-2014 (9 months). He participated in many major campaigns in Iraq \nand Afghanistan serving as a helicopter crew chief. He earned the following medals and \nribbons: Air Medals (six awards); Navy-Marine Corps Achievement Medal (two awards); \nPresidential Unit Citation-Navy; Navy Unit Commendation Medal; Navy Meritorious Unit \nCommendation; Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal (3 awards); National Defense \nService Medal; Afghanistan Campaign Medal (two stars); Iraq Campaign Medal (two \nstars), Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Sea Service Deployment ribbon (five \nstars); NATO Medal; Certificate of Commendation-Individual Award; Letter or \nAppreciation; Meritorious Mast; Expert Rifle Badge; Expert Pistol Badge; and the Naval \nAir Crew Insignia Badge. He held a security clearance while serving in the military.2 \n \nApplicant married in 2016. He has a two-year-old child and another child is due to \nbe born in June 2019. He also has a daughter from a previous relationship who is 14 \nyears old.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decision to leave the military was due to the well-being of his teenage \ndaughter who was living with her mother. The mother had been repeatedly arrested, and \nApplicant was contacted in February 2015 by child protective services regarding the \nwelfare of his daughter. He sought legal advice and was told by his attorney that if \nApplicant continued to serve in the military and with his likely continued overseas \ndeployments, there were minimal avenues for Applicant to pursue regarding obtaining \ncustody of his child. Applicant was concerned about his child\u2019s health and safety because \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit I is Department Counsel\u2019s email. \n \n2 Tr. 22-25, 89-90; GE 1; AE W. \n \n3 Tr. 26. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe child\u2019s mother had drug and alcohol problems. Based on these factors, he decided to \nnot reenlist so he could better address the matters related to his daughter.4  \n \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant and his wife moved to another state. His wife has a sister \nwho has cerebral palsy and needs 24-hour care. His wife had custody of her sister and \nwas providing her care. The purpose of the move was to transfer custody of her sister\u2019s \ncare to her mother, living in the state where they were moving. Her sister\u2019s financial \ndisability assistance was to be also transferred to the mother. Applicant was working at a \ncar dealership.5 When they moved he was able to stay with the same car company, but \nhe was not earning sufficient income. He attempted to obtain a different job in the new \nstate at the large military base where there were numerous federal contractors, but was \nunsuccessful. The cost of the move impacted his family\u2019s finances. The process of \ntransferring custody of his wife\u2019s sister to her mother took longer than expected. Once \ncustody was transferred, Applicant and his wife moved again in August 2016 to \nApplicant\u2019s home state so he could improve his prospects of finding better employment. \nThe cost of this move further impacted his finances.6 \n \n \nWhile Applicant was working for the car company, his child support was \nautomatically deducted from his pay. He had always maintained medical insurance for \nhis daughter, which had been required. It cost approximately $130. The car dealer \nrequired he purchase insurance through their plan, which cost $320 bi-weekly, and was \nthe only way he could comply with the medical insurance required by the state for his \ndaughter. He was also paying $320 in monthly child support. Applicant resigned from this \njob in June 2016 and went to work for a different car dealer, so he could reduce his \nmedical insurance costs for his daughter. During the time he was required to pay the \nexcessive amount for medical insurance, he fell behind on some bills. Also noted is that \nduring the time the car dealer was withholding money for medical insurance, Applicant \nwas still paying the premium for the separate insurance policy he had always maintained \nfor his daughter. Essentially, he was paying for two separate medical insurance policies. \nHe continued to be underemployed with the new car dealer, but he had to remain in the \nstate until his wife\u2019s sister\u2019s custody transfer was completed.7  \n \n \nWhen Applicant moved to his home state in August 2016, he did not have a job. It \ntook two months for him to get a job. In October 2016, he got a job as operations manager \nat a health club. His annual income was $42,000. In November 2016, the mother of his \ndaughter obtained a modification of the child support order increasing it from $320 to \n$560. This did not include the $130 he was paying monthly for medical insurance. \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 25-29.  \n \n5 Tr. 28-32. Applicant began working for the car dealership part-time before he was discharged from the \nmilitary. The child support for his daughter was being deducted from his military pay. When he began the \npart-time job, the state incorrectly deducted child support from his pay. So he was paying double the \nrequired amount. He eventually got the matter corrected.  \n \n6 Tr. 29, 32-34. \n \n7 Tr. 35-42. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the mother of his daughter has four other children and none of their \nfathers were paying child support.8  \n \nThe state where Applicant now lives is the same state where his daughter resides. \nHe received calls from the state\u2019s child protective services informing him that his daughter \nwas cutting herself and syringes were found in her backpack. Applicant withdrew money \nfrom his Thrift Saving Plan (TSP) and paid the penalty. He paid a $3,500 retainer to his \nattorney so he could obtain full custody of his daughter. He was driving every other week \nto visit his daughter and spending between $80 and $100 for the trip, and to purchase \nnecessities for her that her mother was not providing. His attorney advised him that he \nwould be required to show he had a good and stable home environment before pursuing \ncustody of his daughter. He used the remaining money of his TSP to pay the expenses \nto move into a home in February 2017. During this time, he paid some of his smaller \ndelinquent bills.9  \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant\u2019s wife miscarried. They incurred unplanned medical \nexpenses that were not covered by insurance. This impacted their finances.10  \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant got a better paying job with a government contractor. In \nNovember 2017, Applicant went to court to obtain full custody of his daughter. His \ndaughter asked him to pursue custody. He was granted custody. The mother was granted \nsupervised visitation. The mother refused to relinquish custody despite the court order \nand the daughter\u2019s wishes that she live with Applicant. In December 2017, the police \nenforced the court order. The police took her from school. His daughter did not have any \nof her belongings. Applicant had to purchase clothes and supplies for his daughter. The \nmother is required to pay $320 a month for child support and $120 for insurance. She has \nnever made a payment.11  \n \nIn February 2018, the mother of Applicant\u2019s daughter filed for custody of their \ndaughter. Applicant paid a $2,500 retainer to his lawyer. As of the date of his hearing, he \nwas waiting for a court date. He testified that his daughter does not want to return to the \nmother\u2019s home. Applicant also noted that there are criminal charges pending against the \nmother\u2019s husband, who she no longer lives with, for sexual assault on Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter.12  \n \nApplicant testified that he has attempted to manage his finances throughout these \nextraordinary events that have had a major effect on him. His wife is pregnant and due to \nnumerous complications, they have incurred additional medical expenses that continue \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 34, 41-45; AE Q. \n \n9 Tr. 45-46. \n \n10 Tr. 52-53. \n \n11 Tr. 47-51; AE O, R. \n \n12 Tr. 46, 53-56. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nto impact their finances. He indicated that the expendable income that remains at the end \nof each month has been used to pay the additional medical expenses that are not fully \ncovered by their medical insurance. He prioritized paying the medical bills for his wife. His \nwife is due to deliver the baby in June. Applicant is hopeful that after a period of \nadjustment, their medical expenses will be reduced, and their expendable income can be \nused to resolve more of their debts. He also has prepaid $4,000 for the upcoming medical \nbills for the birth of their child. He provided receipts to show his payments.13  \n \nApplicant enlisted in the National Guard in April 2019. He began paying $281 \nmonthly for medical insurance through Tricare. He explained that he is entitled to use \nTricare, but must pay monthly premiums. He anticipates being reimbursed from Tricare \nfor the amount he prepaid for upcoming medical bills associated with the birth of his child. \nHe plans to use the reimbursement money to make payments toward other debts. \nApplicant admits that he had intended to make more payments towards his debts, but the \nintervening child custody costs and his wife\u2019s pregnancy complications prevented him \nfrom doing so.14  \n \nApplicant testified that he has paid about $8,000 toward medical bills associated \nwith his wife\u2019s conditions and a credit card in her name. In his new job, he earns about \n$79,000. Because he enlisted in the National Guard, he anticipates receiving a $7,500 \nbonus in the future. He is also attending college and receives a Pell Grant. His tuition is \npaid through the GI Bill. He and his wife have one car. His mother purchased a vehicle \nfor Applicant, and he pays her the monthly amount of the loan. Applicant receives about \n$500 a month in Veteran\u2019s disability compensation. He uses this amount to pay the car \nnote and insurance. He stated that due to the cost of childcare, it is not financially sensible \nto have his wife work. He has prioritized paying his wife\u2019s medical bills.15   \n \nApplicant has been unable to begin repaying the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d due \nto the intervening family matters in his life. He intends to start making payments of $200 \ntoward the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d once he can determine where to send the money. He \ncredibly stated that he intends to begin payments on the other debt after his wife gives \nbirth and their additional medical expenses are reduced.16  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is for a vehicle lease that Applicant surrendered. He has \ndiscussed a settlement agreement with the creditor. He intends to begin paying this debt \nafter the birth of his child.17  \n \n                                                          \n13 Tr. 66-69; AE I, J, K. \n \n14 Tr. 65-67; AE S. \n \n15 Tr. 75-82. \n \n16 Tr. 56-59, 61-64, 69-70; AE S. \n \n17 Tr. 59-61, 69-70; AE S, T. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has one payment remaining on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He is resolving \nthis debt. He testified that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h are for the same debt with \u00b6 \n1.e being the collection company for the original creditor in \u00b6 1.h. He resolved this debt in \nMarch 2017. It is not reflected on his most recent credit reports.18 Applicant testified he \nresolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. They are not reflected on his most recent credit \nreports and are resolved.19  \n \nApplicant provided documents to show he was underemployed while working for \nthe car dealerships in 2015 and 2016, and he was unemployed for several months \nbetween his moves. He also provided a copy of his budget. He does not have any credit \ncards. All of his monthly expenses are current.20 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n                                                          \n18 Tr. 72-74; GE 3, 4; AE L, U, V. The debt is on his September 2017 credit report, but not the August 2018 \nor May 2019 credit reports. \n \n19 Tr. 61-64, 72-74; GE 4; AE U, V. \n \n20 Tr. 82-85; GE 1; AE C, D, E, M, N, O, T. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts, which began accruing in approximately 2015. He \nhas been unable to timely pay them, until recently. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are attributed to several major life crises, which he \nhad little or no control over. He was serving in the military when he made a decision that \nfor the safety and health of his daughter he would not reenlist. He responsibly sought \ncustody of his daughter. He had to hire an attorney and establish a stable home. His wife \nhad a miscarriage and there were medical debts not covered by insurance. She is \npresently pregnant and has significant medical issues that are not fully covered by \ninsurance. Applicant and his wife moved so they could transfer custody and care of his \nwife\u2019s disabled sister to her mother. His wife had been providing all of her sister\u2019s care. \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment. His employer required \nhim to purchase costly medical insurance through their plan, which meant he was paying \nfor two separate insurance policies for his daughter. He and his wife moved so Applicant \ncould improve his employment opportunities. When he was awarded custody of his child, \nafter police intervention, she went to live with Applicant. She had no belongings, so \nApplicant had to purchase her necessities. Her mother is seeking custody of the daughter, \nand Applicant has again incurred legal expenses. All of these events impacted Applicant\u2019s \nfinances and were beyond his control.  \n \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly by moving to find a better paying job; joining the \nNational Guard so he will receive a financial bonus and be eligible for less expensive \nmedical insurance; and prioritizing his wife\u2019s medical bills by prepaying them. The \ncircumstances that have affected Applicant\u2019s finances are unlikely to recur and do not \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant has not \nignored his debts. He has paid some smaller debts and he intends to begin repaying the \nlarger ones after his child is born and his finances are more stable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \napply. AG \u00b6 20(d) partially applies. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He honorably served our country in war and had \nnumerous overseas deployments. His reason for not reenlisting, after almost ten years of \nservice, was because he was concerned for his daughter\u2019s health and safety. He spent a \nconsiderable amount of money to obtain legal custody of his daughter, and subsequently \nprovide basic necessities for her after he gained custody. The mother is not paying her \ncourt ordered child support for their daughter, and instead is taking Applicant to court to \nregain custody.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was providing full-time care for her disabled sister. Applicant and \nhis wife incurred moving expenses so they could transfer the care of her sister back to \nher mother. He was underemployed and unemployed. They again incurred moving \nexpenses when they moved so he could find better employment prospects. His wife \nsuffered a miscarriage, and some of the medical expenses were not covered. She \npresently has a high-risk pregnancy, and Applicant has prioritized the payment of her \nmedical expenses. He paid some of his delinquent debts, but others remain. He enlisted \nin the National Guard and will receive a financial bonus. He is now eligible for less costly \nmedical care through Tricare and should be reimbursed for medical expenses he prepaid. \nHe plans to use these resources to address his remaining debts.  \n \nThis is not a situation in which Applicant has acted irresponsibly or ignored his \nfinancial obligations. Applicant has made responsible and mature decisions concerning \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncomplex life events. Under the circumstances, he has managed to pay most of his \nexpenses, protect his daughter by obtaining custody of her, and made his wife and unborn \nchild\u2019s health a priority. I found his testimony credible and believe he will repay the \nremaining delinquent debts. I do not have questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness, as exhibited by his exemplary military service for ten years. He has met \nhis burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline \nF, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Applicant timely answered \nthe SOR and requested a hearing. \n                                                          \n1This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017. \n     \n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn January 8, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On May 30, 2019, the \nhearing was held as scheduled. After reviewing Applicant\u2019s hearing transcript, \nevidence, and post-hearing evidence, I emailed the parties indicating that this case \nwas appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. Applicant did not \nobject. Department Counsel had 10 days to consider the matter and then provided \ntimely written notice that Department Counsel did not object.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed 12 allegations consisting primarily of student loans, \nconsumer debt, and credit card debt under Guideline F. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \nstem from a costly divorce in 2013. In that divorce, he lost his home, was required to \npay spousal and child support, and incurred all of the marital debt, which forms the \nmajority of the SOR allegations. Applicant has since regained control of his finances \nand has paid or is in an established payment plan for all of the SOR debts.  \n \nApplicant successfully held a security clearance during his 20 years in the U.S. \nNavy. He has an excellent reputation for trustworthiness. Based on the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude that Department Counsel presented sufficient \nevidence to establish the facts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F. I also conclude \nthat Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts \nadmitted by Applicant or proven by Department Counsel. In particular, I conclude that \nthe financial considerations security concerns are resolved in whole or in part under \napplicable mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (d).  \n \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems do not create doubt \nabout his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, \nApplicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. This \ncase is decided for Applicant.  \n \n \n \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

On September 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline F. (Item 1.) The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 25, 2018 (Answer), and requested a \ndecision on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on October 18, 2018. Soon thereafter, a complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, including documents identified as \nItems 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on \nOctober 29, 2018, and on November 8, 2018, submitted a Response. Items 1 through 6, \nand Applicant\u2019s Response are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 6, 2019. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 56, is divorced. (Item 2 at page 7, and Response at page 4.)

As he has \noffered nothing further as to the $55,000 delinquency, this allegation is found against \nApplicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant admits a charged-off \u201chome equity line\u201d debt in the amount of about \n$97,000. (Answer at page 1.) As he has offered nothing further as to this admitted \ndelinquency, this allegation is also found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.c.~1.e. Applicant admits three additional past-due debts totaling in excess of \n$714. As he has offered nothing further as to these admitted delinquencies, these \nallegations are found against Applicant. \n  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s divorce and loss of his former \nspouse\u2019s income were conditions beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly to \naddress the resulting debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM does \nnot demonstrate his efforts to resolve his delinquencies. The record is silent as to his \ncurrent ability to address his delinquent debts. His financial problems are not under \ncontrol.  \n \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n5 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nfinancial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

He claimed \nthat he received minimal income (below $8,000 annually from 2012 to 2017). He was a \nprofessional commercial tractor-trailer driver with opportunities to earn substantially more \nincome. He did not establish that he was unable to increase his income which would have \nenabled him to better address his delinquent taxes. He did not provide proof of any \npayments to address his delinquent state tax debts. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 16, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued an undated \namended SOR. (HE 3)  \n \nOn October 28, 2018, December 14, 2018, and March 1, 2019, Applicant \nresponded to the SOR and amended SOR. (HE 4) On December 14, 2018, he requested \na hearing. (HE 5) On June 28, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July \n19, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On July 19, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for July 29, 2019, using video teleconference. (HE 1) \nApplicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of the \nhearing. (Tr. 12-14; HE 5)   \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 exhibits; Applicant offered 2 \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 16-18; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-11; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE B). \nOn August 5, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.   \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR responses, he denied all of the SOR allegations. (HE 4) He \nalso provided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 4) Applicant\u2019s SOR responses \nand attached documentation are admitted into evidence. (Tr. 11-12)  \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old commercial truck driver. (Tr. 8) He has worked for a \ngovernment contractor for almost two years under a lease contract. (Tr. 8) He needs a \nsecurity clearance to enable him to deliver hazardous materials. (Tr. 8) In the late 1970s, \nhe receive a General Education Diploma (GED). (Tr. 6) He has not attended college. (Tr. \n6) Applicant served in the Army from 1983 to 1988; he left the Army as a private (E-2); \nand he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 7, 19; GE 2) He was a truck driver in the \nArmy, and he denied that he received nonjudicial punishment while he was in the Army. \n(Tr. 7)  \n \nApplicant was married twice, and his most recent divorce was in 1998. (Tr. 19) He \nhas four adult children, and they do not live with him. (Tr. 20) He has cohabitated with his \nco-driver for the past 14 years. (Tr. 20) Applicant has been a truck driver since about \n2006. (Tr. 21-22) Applicant has lived for more than three years in state M1. (Tr. 22; GE \n1) His cohabitant owns his residence, and Applicant pays part of the mortgage. (Tr. 22) \n \nApplicant left state S \u201cmany years ago\u201d possibly in 1998. (Tr. 27) He was unclear \nabout when he moved from state S. (Tr. 28-29) In 2013, Applicant moved to state M1 \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nfrom state T. (Tr. 23; GE 1) In state T, he used a post-office address because he was \noften on the road or staying with family and friends. (Tr. 23-24) He lives in state M1 with \nhis cohabitant when he in not traveling as a truck driver. (Tr. 26) His cohabitant owns the \n18-wheel truck that he drives. (Tr. 45-46) Applicant said he paid his recent state tax debts. \n(Tr. 42) Applicant does not have taxes withheld from his paycheck, and he pays his taxes \nwhen he files his tax returns. (Tr. 56) His cohabitant pays him as a private contractor. (Tr. \n56)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d allege the federal government filed tax liens as follows: in \n2014, for $161,857; in 2013, for $161,133; in 2003, for $154,534; and in 2005, for \n$51,092. Applicant\u2019s October 28, 2017 combined credit report from three credit reporting \ncompanies showed the two federal tax liens for $161,857 and $161,833. (GE 4 at 2-3) \nThe two federal tax liens for $154,534 and $51,092 were shown in LexisNexis but not in \nthe October 28, 2017 combined credit report. (GE 5; GE 6)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.h allege that state government S filed tax liens as follows: \nin 2002, for $10,987; in 2003, for $10,693; in 2003, for $17,357; and in 2003, for $11,424. \nThe four tax liens were shown in LexisNexis. (GE 7-GE 10) SOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that state \ngovernment M1 filed a state tax lien in 2007 for $13,191. The tax lien was shown in \nLexisNexis. (GE 11) \n \nThe federal and state tax lien documentation in the file do not include information \nabout which tax years resulted in the delinquent taxes in the liens. \n \nOn September 25, 2017, Applicant said in response to DOHA interrogatories that \nhe filed and owed the amounts depicted in the following table for federal income taxes. \n(GE 2 at 2) The table also shows adjusted gross income from the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS) tax transcripts he provided. (GE 2 at 5-10; AE B) The IRS tax transcripts \nfor tax years 1999, 2002, and 2012 through 2017 show an account balance of zero.

(GE 2) He did not say anything about state taxes owed in \nstate S or M1. (GE 2) \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nThe IRS tax transcript for tax year 2011 indicated \u201cRETURN NOT PRESENT FOR \nTHIS ACCOUNT.\u201d (GE 2 at 4) The SOR did not allege that he failed to file his 2011 federal \nincome tax return, and this discrepancy is not being considered as a disqualifying fact in \nApplicant\u2019s case. Applicant\u2019s claimed income, which is not part of the record, might have \nbeen too low to necessitate filing a federal income tax return. \n \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax transcript dated March 6, 2019, indicates for tax year 1999, he \ndid not pay any taxes until December 6, 2004, when he paid $5,058. In 2013, the IRS \ndetermined the tax for tax year 1999 was uncollectable, and in 2013, the lien was \nremoved. (AE B) On June 9, 2014, the IRS wrote off the $57,127 balance due, and his \ntax transcript indicates the current balance owed is zero. (AE B) \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax transcript dated March 6, 2019, indicates for tax year 2002, the IRS \nfiled a substitute return on December 1, 2003, and the only payment made was a transfer \nfrom tax year 2012 of $517. (AE B) The IRS filed liens in 2013 and 2014 seeking collection \nfor tax year 2002. (AE B) In 2014, the IRS wrote off the $56,302 balance owed and \nremoved the liens. (AE B) Applicant agreed with Department Counsel\u2019s statement that he \npreviously owed more than $300,000 in federal taxes, and he paid nothing to address his \ndelinquent tax debt. (Tr. 35) Applicant did not submit tax transcripts for several tax years, \nand tax transcripts would have been helpful for a more complete understanding of how \nmost of his federal income tax debt was generated. \n \nApplicant attributed his initial tax problems to unemployment, inability to pay, and \nletting things \u201cget out of hand.\u201d (Tr. 33-34) Applicant said his annual income was about \n$23,000, and in 2018, it was about $30,000. (Tr. 29) He did not specify the year in which \nhis annual income was $23,000. He was employed during the previous 10 years. (Tr. 29) \nHe estimated he drove about eight or nine months of the year, and about two to five days \na week. (Tr. 44) He is paid based on the miles he drives. (Tr. 44) The IRS did not audit \nhis income taxes. (Tr. 32) At his hearing, Applicant insisted that he honestly reported and \ndid not underreport his income to the IRS. (Tr. 36, 52)  \n \nApplicant pays his cohabitant $250 a month for rent. (Tr. 30) He has less than $400 \nin his checking and savings accounts. (Tr. 30) He does not have a 401(k) retirement \naccount. (Tr. 30-31) He did not receive financial counseling. (Tr. 38) \n \nApplicant provided a March 26, 2019 letter from a debt resolution firm stating \nApplicant\u2019s past due liabilities from the IRS, state M1, and state S were resolved. (SOR \nresponse) Applicant\u2019s October 2018, Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian credit reports \ndid not indicate any tax liens. (SOR response) \n \nApplicant admitted that he had several tax liens from state S and one from state \nM1. (Tr. 38-39) Applicant said some of them could be duplications because they were \nfiled the same year. (Tr. 39) Applicant said he called state S and state M1 tax authorities \nabout two months before his hearing, and he learned state S wanted a total of about \n$57,000 and state M1 wanted about $8,000. (Tr. 39, 41) The four state S tax liens in \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e through 1.h total $50,461. He did not provide proof that any of the State S tax liens \nwere duplications. He conceded the March 26, 2019 letter from a debt resolution firm was \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nincorrect about resolution of the state tax liens. (Tr. 40, 47) He learned that generally his \ndebt resolution firm does not resolve or address state tax problems. (Tr. 48) He said he \nhad been making payments of unspecified amounts to states M1 and S every year for the \nlast 10 or 15 years; however, he did not provide proof of such payments. (Tr. 46)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history \nof tax debt from 1999 to present establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nApplicant had a period of unemployment around 2003, and he reported \nexceptionally low income received from his cohabitant from 2012 to 2017. These are \ncircumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. However, these \ncircumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant was a professional commercial tractor-trailer driver with \nopportunities to earn substantially more income. He did not establish that he was unable \nto increase his income which would have enabled him to better address his delinquent \ntaxes. He did not provide proof that he diligently sought or was unable to seek higher-\npaying employment. \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nHe employed a debt resolution company, which was able to convince the IRS that he had \nvery low income and that he qualified for uncollectable status. On June 9, 2014, the IRS \nwrote off about $300,000 in delinquent federal income tax debt. I have credited Applicant \nwith mitigating his federal income tax debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to address his \ndelinquent state tax debts owed to states S and M1 as reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through \n1.i. He could have obtained more income because of his profession as a professional \ncommercial truck driver. He owes an estimated $65,000 in state income tax debt. He \nfailed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old commercial truck driver. He has worked for a \ngovernment contractor for almost two years under a lease contract. He needs a security \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nclearance to enable him to deliver hazardous materials. Applicant served in the Army from \n1983 to 1988; he left the Army as a private (E-2); and he received an honorable discharge.    \n \nFrom 1999 to 2002, Applicant received substantial income, and he did not pay his \nfederal and state income taxes in full when due. By 2014, he owed about $300,000 in \ndelinquent federal income taxes, and the tax transcripts he provided showed minimal \npayments to the IRS, except for a $5,058 payment on December 6, 2004. On June 9, \n2014, the IRS declared his federal tax debts to be uncollectable and wrote them off. For \nmore than four years, he has had no delinquent federal income taxes, according to his \nIRS tax transcripts. I have mitigated the federal tax debts listed in the SOR. \n \nApplicant admitted that state S wants a total of about $57,000 and state M1 wants \nabout $8,000 from Applicant. The primary problem here is that Applicant has known that \nhe needed to pay his state income taxes for several years, and he failed to provide \nevidence that he attempted to secure better paying employment. He kept working for his \ncohabitant who was paying him very little. For example, in 2017, he told the IRS that his \nadjusted gross income from driving an 18-wheel truck was only $1,109, and the federal \npoverty level for a single person in 2017 was $12,060. See Federal Health and Human \nServices website (https://aspe.hhs.gov/2017-poverty-guidelines). If he worked 52 weeks \na year, 40 hours a week, and earned $7.50 an hour (the national minimum wage), his \nannual income would be $15,600. Working for annual income substantially below the \nminimum wage, when such substantial state tax debts were owed, shows a lack of \nfinancial good judgment. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime.   \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e through 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant was unemployed and underemployed from 2011 to 2017. He \nfailed to file his federal and state income tax returns as required for 2015 through 2017 \nbecause he was concerned that he had insufficient funds to pay his taxes. Based upon \nthe record as a whole, his evidence was insufficient to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his failures to file his tax returns, as required. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) setting three allegations under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive \n\n2 \n \n4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions \non or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn May 8, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting two tax allegations in \nthe SOR with additional comments regarding mitigating circumstances and denying a \nthird allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.c), which was subsequently withdrawn. He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn June 20, 2019, Department Counsel withdrew the third SOR allegation, which was a \ndrafting error. On August 2, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on the same day, scheduling the hearing on August 19, 2019.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented four \nproposed exhibits, which I marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant \noffered four proposed exhibits, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D. \nI kept the record open until September 6, 2019, to give Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional evidence. He subsequently requested an extension of time until September 20, \n2019, which I granted. Applicant submitted five additional exhibits in multiple emails prior \nto the closing of the record, one of which contained duplicates of AE B through D along \nwith other additional documents. For completeness and the clarity of the record, I have \nmarked all five exhibits and the related emails from Applicant and Department Counsel \nas AE E through I. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. I, sua \nsponte, extended Applicant\u2019s time to submit additional evidence until October 25, 2019. \nOn that date, Applicant wrote in an email that he was unable to provide any additional \ndocumentation. I have marked his email and a prior thread of emails as Hearing Exhibit \n3, and additional prior emails as Hearing Exhibits 1 and 2. I received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on August 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file his 2014-2017 federal \nand state taxes as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). I have incorporated his admissions in \nmy findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 1, his security \nclearance application, dated August 3, 2017, (SCA) unless otherwise indicated by a \nparenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 67, has worked as an engineer for a defense contractor since June \n2017. Prior to that, he was unemployed since 2011, except for two temporary, low-paying \njobs. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in 1975. He held a secret \nclearance from 1986 to 1991 when he was an employee of a defense contractor. He has \nnever married and has one child (age17). (Tr. 11, 12, 23, 24, 25-26.) \n \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted that he failed to file federal and state tax \nreturns in 2014 through 2017. He wrote that this was due to the fact that he believed he \nowed taxes and could not afford to pay them. He was struggling with his unemployment \n\n3 \n \nand was scared. At the hearing he admitted that he did the worst thing he could do, which \nwas nothing. He subsequently determined that he did, in fact, file his federal tax return for \n2014 as required, and he provided a copy of that return as evidence. It reflects a filing \ndate of April 13, 2015, and that he was due to receive a refund of $1,339. The status of \nhis 2014 state tax return is unclear. He also wrote in his SOR response that he was in the \nprocess of preparing his delinquent returns, starting with the most recent year, 2018. The \nSOR does not allege that he failed to file his 2018 federal and state returns as required. \n(Tr. 31; AE C, D, G.)  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant submitted copies of his 2018 and 2017 federal and state \ntax returns, dated August 1 and 8, 2019, shortly before the hearing date. If he had filed \nfor an extension in 2018 and his federal and state returns and tax payments would have \nbeen due on October 15, 2019. He testified that he did not file for an extension, though a \nletter from his tax preparer suggests that he did. (SOR response; AE C, D, H; AE E at 45-\n46; Tr. 28-29, 47.) \n \n \nThe remaining security concerns under the SOR allegations were Applicant\u2019s \nfederal and state tax returns for 2015 and 2016. On September 11, 2019, he submitted \ncopies of the first two pages of his 2015 and 2016 federal tax returns. Both returns reflect \nthat he owed no taxes. He noted in his email that the returns were not yet filed and would \nonly be released by the tax preparer for filing once he paid the preparer\u2019s fee, which he \nsaid would \u201cbe in a few days.\u201d He never communicated or documented after the hearing \nthat these two returns had been filed. (AE H.) \n \n \nEven though Appellant incorrectly disclosed in his SCA that he owed federal and \nstate income taxes for 2015 and 2016, the SOR does not allege that he failed to pay his \nfederal and state taxes as required. In his SOR response, he volunteered that he was in \nthe process of obtaining a home equity loan to pay his delinquent taxes. As noted, \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax returns for the years 2015 and 2016 reflect he owes no income \ntaxes in those years.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 and 2018 federal tax returns reflect that he owes $340 and \n$7,161, respectively. His state returns reflect that he is due a refund for 2017 of $444 and \nowes $2,679 for 2018. He also volunteered a document from the state tax authority, dated \nMarch 20, 2019, notifying him that it was garnishing his wages to pay a tax debt of $6,364 \nfor the year 2016. The notice predates Applicant\u2019s filing of his state tax return for that \nyear, so the amount due is merely an estimate by the state and may change since he was \nunemployed in 2016. (SOR response; AE E at 2, 11, 22, 35, 43, 45-47; AE F at 3; Tr. 32, \n35, 43-45, 53.) \n \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant was in the final stage of obtaining a home \nequity line of credit (HELOC) in the amount of $75,000. He submitted at the hearing the \nlender\u2019s conditional approval letter, dated as of August 7, 2019. In an email dated August \n28, 2019, he wrote that he expected to receive the loan proceeds in about a month. He \nwrote further that he intends to pay his past due taxes to the IRS and the state tax \n\n4 \n \nauthority once the HELOC loan is finalized. After the hearing, Applicant advised that he \ndid not qualify for the HELOC. (AE B, AE G at 1; Tr. 52-60; Hearing Ex. 3 at 4.) \n \n \nDuring his extended period of unemployment, Applicant maintained financial \nstability. Presently, he is earning about $20,000 in annual income less than he did in \n2011, but is able to pay his bills. He has no delinquent consumer debt and has only one \ncredit card with a relatively small balance. His vehicle was paid off in 2010. He has \nretirement accounts worth about $600,000. It appears that Applicant is unwilling to pay \nhis tax debts with funds from these accounts. While unemployed in 2015, he refinanced \nhis home mortgage with a 15-year mortgage in the amount of $159,000. The mortgage \nloan has a current balance of about $125,000. He supported himself during his years of \nunemployment by selling assets in his personal investment account at the rate of about \n$75,000 per year for several years. He no longer has those assets, but it is clear from his \ntestimony that he manages his finances very conservatively. He loves his job and would \nlike to continue working there for as long as possible. He wants to do something \nmeaningful with his life and his current position is a good place for him to do so. He had \nintended to pay for his share of his child\u2019s college expenses with assets he has invested \nover the years in a special college investment account and with borrowing from the \nHELOC. It is very important to Applicant that his child have the opportunity to attend and \ncomplete college. (GE 3 at 5, 8; GE 4 at 3, 4; Tr. 11-16, 36-37, 49-51; Hearing Ex. 3 at 1-\n3.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a personal reference from a long-time friend and former work \ncolleague. The friend wrote that Applicant has a history of protecting his employer\u2019s \nsecrets and that despite his financial challenges due to his unemployment, he behaved \nresponsibly during that prolonged period by reducing his expense while also providing for \nhis child. (AE I at 2.) \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n6 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying condition under this \nguideline for the two remaining allegations in the SOR: AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file . . . \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns . . . as required.\u201d)  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; [and] \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s behavior was in response to the \nhighly unusual, lengthy period of unemployment he encountered and the financial stress \nthis created. He recognizes that his unemployment does not excuse his failure to file. He \nhas prepared his delinquent federal tax returns for 2015 and 2016, which reflect that he \nowes no taxes. He must pay the tax preparer before the federal returns will be released \nand filed. He provided no evidence that he has filed these returns or the state returns for \nthese two years. With his retirement funds, he has the financial resources available to \npay his tax delinquencies. For personal reasons, he has apparently declined to file his \ntwo delinquent tax returns and pay his past-due taxes. Under all of the circumstances, his \nbehavior since 2015 casts doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant experienced an unusually long period \nof unemployment or underemployment that was beyond his control. It cannot be said, \nhowever, that his failure to file his tax returns during the 2015 through 2017 period were \n\n7 \n \nlargely beyond his control. He recognizes that he made a mistake by not filing. He has \nnot remedied his filing delinquencies for 2015 and 2016, and the status of his 2014 state \ntax return is unknown. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established with respect to Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax filings. He \nhas not filed his 2015 and 2016 tax returns. It not clear why he has not paid his tax \npreparer and obtained the release of the federal forms for filing, since they are already \nprepared and they reflect that he owes no taxes for those years. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment. I have taken into \nconsideration Applicant\u2019s age, his unfortunate, long period of unemployment, and his \ndesire to continue working to support himself and to pay for his son\u2019s education.  \n \n \nThe SOR does not allege that he failed to pay federal and state taxes in any years. \nThe evidence revealed that he has some tax debts still outstanding. For purposes of a \nwhole-person assessment, it is appropriate to note that he has failed to pay these taxes. \nIt is also appropriate, however, to observe that he voluntarily disclosed these debts at the \nhearing and in a post-hearing evidentiary submission. Overall, his failure to pay these \ntaxes is part of the larger pattern of Applicant\u2019s mismanagement of his important tax \nobligations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation is insufficient to address the security concerns \nraised by his mistakes and errors in judgment. After weighing the disqualifying and \n\n8 \n \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all of the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

Smith, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/09/2019\n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n    Statement of the Case \nOn September 17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nor after June 8, 2017. On October 27, 2018, Applicant timely submitted a response in \nwhich he requested a hearing based on the written record. The Government converted \nthe case from an administrative determination to a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA).  \nOn April 4, 2019, I was assigned the case. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nMay 30, 2019, setting the hearing for June 26, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered three documents, accepted without objection as \nexhibits (Exs.) 1-3. Applicant offered testimony and three documents, accepted without \nobjection as Exs. A-C. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 8, 2019. Applicant was \ngiven through July 27, 2019, to submit any additional materials. On July 27, 2019, \nApplicant submitted one additional document, which was forwarded to me by the \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nGovernment on June 30, 2019. Noting no objection from Department Counsel, the item \nwas accepted as Ex. D. The record was then closed. Based on the exhibits, testimony, \nand record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated criminal conduct security concerns.   \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old construction worker who previously worked in the area \nof security. He hopes to return to that field. Applicant earned a diploma from high school \nand attended some college. He is single and the father of a toddler. In early 2014, \nApplicant was away from home attending college. Although he had filed to change his \naddress for mail purposes, some correspondence got misrouted. Unreceived mail \nincluded notices regarding his computerized highway toll-pass balances which, being \nneglected because of Applicant\u2019s inability to receive them, were mounting. Because of \nthe balances owed on the pass, Applicant\u2019s state suspended his driver\u2019s license.   \n \nDuring June 2014, Applicant was cited for possession of marijuana and operating \na motor vehicle on a suspended license. The next day, he addressed the issue \nregarding the toll-pass balance owed and the suspended-license. (Tr. 19) The \nmarijuana charge was later dropped and one of his passengers was charged with \npossession of the marijuana at issue. Applicant pled guilty to the suspended license \ncharge in November 2014, and was sentenced to probation before judgment. He \nsuccessfully completed a one-year period of unsupervised probation in November 2015. \n \nIn late April 2015, Applicant was playing basketball at a neighborhood park.  The \ngame was \u201cintense,\u201d and \u201call of a sudden shots had broke out, and nobody really had \nknew what happened.\u201d (Tr. 22) Upon hearing gunshots, Applicant fled and got a ride \nwith a friend, who then000 called the police. It was later determined that two of the \nplayers Applicant did not know were involved in an altercation giving rise to the \ngunshots which injured one individual. (Tr. 22) During the investigation, the names of all \nparticipants were collected by investigators.  \n \nAs part of the group at the scene, Applicant and others were ultimately indicted. \nApplicant was indicted with two felonies, acting as an accessory after the fact to first- \nand second-degree murder, and three misdemeanors: unlawfully wearing, carrying, and \ntransporting a firearm; possession of a regulated firearm by a person under 21; and \npossession of a dangerous weapon on school property. A film of the incident \ncorroborated his version of what happened. (Tr. 27-28) Later, Applicant and some other \nplayers reached a plea deal that put the matter on the inactive docket for a year, after \nwhich the matter was poised to be dropped. (Tr. 28-29)  Applicant accepted this process \nas his best way to move the matter along and not jeopardize his job or his pursuit of \nwork in the security industry. His record was expunged in 2017.  \n \nIn early 2018, Applicant began dating his former girlfriend. Their relationship \nlasted a few months, during which time he became the father of his now-toddler child \nwith another woman. During their period of intimacy, however, she saw some things on \nhis cell phone which caused her to \u201cput on all lies just to get\u201d him in trouble. (Tr. 31) In \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nApril 2018, she reported to the authorities that Applicant had entered into her home, \nassaulted her, and took her cell phone. (Tr. 31) She also reported that he has assaulted \nher on other occasions. (Tr. 32) Applicant ended the relationship because of \u201cher lying \nand everything like that, and me having this kind of job, and wanting to do better for \nmyself I couldn\u2019t associate myself with such a female like that.\u201d (Tr. 31)  \n \nApplicant was ultimately charged in May 2018 with two felonies, robbery and \nthird-degree burglary, and two misdemeanors, second-degree assault and theft of \nproperty valued between $100 and under $1,500. The ex-girlfriend later recanted her \ntale. After the hearing, she wrote a letter denying any assault had ever occurred and \nnoted that she was not in fear of Applicant. (Ex. D) Without a witness, the state \npermitted the matter to be put on the inactive docket for a year, after which the matter \nwill be dropped. (Ex. 4.d; Tr. 36-37) The matter should be dropped by September 2019 \nassuming Applicant has no further criminal issues. \n \nToday, Applicant lives a quiet life. He visits with his toddler son in another state \non weekends. He has changed his focus from old friends and his teenage \nacquaintances to working extra hours and family time. He spends his free time in a local \ngym rather than at a neighborhood park. He now associates with a more responsible \ncrowd. He timely pays $425 a month in child support for his toddler. Other than the \nissues noted above, he has had no brushes with the law. Applicant noted that these \nincidents have provided life lessons and \u201cnow I make sure I change the whole way that I \nmove.\u201d (Tr. 40) He is presently seeking to find a career path in which to learn and \nprogress professionally. He provided two positive recommendation letters. (Exs. A-B) \nHe is seeking a security clearance in order to work as a security guard or specialist.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that sny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThe three documented incidents at issue in the SOR are sufficient to give rise to \nthe following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin 6 combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nNow in his mid-20s, Applicant is a more mature individual who is in search of a \nprofessional career in security. He no longer associates with his former neighborhood \nand school peers, or hangs out at neighborhood parks for pick-up games of basketball \nwith neighbors and strangers. As a new father, he spends his weekends out of state \nwith his toddler. He is timely on his child support. Applicant works overtime and has \nbeen diligent in his pursuit of a security clearance and work in the security field. He \nsocializes with a more mature and responsible crowd. He has developed a favorable \nreputation at work. His brushes with the law are limited to the three incidents at issue, \nwith only the driving on a suspended license charge from over five years resulting in a \nconviction. In light of these considerations, I find AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I incorporated my comments under the applicable \nguideline in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s credible testimony, \ndemeanor at the hearing, age, maturation, behavioral changes, and family situation.  \n \n \nThe three incidents at issue occurred between the time Applicant was a teen and \nage 21. In the first incident, he was incorrectly ascribed to have been in possession of \nmarijuana, a charge later determined to be inaccurate. When he discovered his driver\u2019s \nlicense had been suspended due to incidents of which he had been unaware, he \nexpeditiously took care of that issue on his own initiative. The record shows he was not \npart of the basketball fracas and gunfight from which he fled.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \n \nAs for the charges regarding assault against Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, the facts \ntend to favor Applicant inasmuch as the accusations appear to have been recklessly \nmade by a jealous or scorned girlfriend, a situation further inflamed by her discovery of \npersonal information on his cell phone and the upcoming birth of his child with another \nwoman. The ex-girlfriend recanted her story to the police at the time, and has more \nrecently written a post-hearing letter continuing to recant her tale of abuse. In light of \nthese indicators, I find the allegations raised against him to be highly inflated, if not \ntotally fabricated. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude criminal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on January \n15, 2019. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to any of the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. She submitted a series of documents, which were admitted \ncollectively as exhibit (AE) A. Items 3-11 are also admitted without objection. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 28, 2019.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR with explanations, except \u00b6 1.i, \nwhich she denied. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 63 years old. She is a retired federal employee currently seeking a \nposition with a federal contractor. She is single, twice divorced, with three adult children. \nShe achieved her GED in 1985 and has taken some college courses.1 \nThe SOR alleged Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1991 (discharged); \nChapter 7 in 2002 (discharged); Chapter 13 in 2009 (dismissed); Chapter 7 in 2012 \n(discharged); and Chapter 13 in 2014 (dismissed) (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e). The SOR also alleged \nshe was delinquent on her federal income taxes in the amount of $18,717 for years  \n2010 and 2014-2016, and state income taxes in the amount of $4,754 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.g). It \nfurther alleged she owed on six delinquent collection accounts in the total amount of \napproximately $18,868. These accounts are comprised of a medical bill, utility debt, an \napartment debt, a repossessed car debt, and consumer debt. The allegations are \nsupported by credit reports from April 2018 and October 2018, Applicant\u2019s statement to \na defense investigator in May 2018, various bankruptcy filings, and Applicant\u2019s SOR \nadmissions.2 \nApplicant claimed financial hardship when she retired from her government \nposition in 2017 and had to wait several months before she began receiving retired pay. \nShe documented this delay. There is no evidence of financial counseling.3 \nBankruptcies. Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcies and was discharged from \nher debts in 1991, 2002, and 2013 as a result of those proceedings. In 2009 and 2014 \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions. Both those actions were dismissed. \nThere is no information as to the reason the 2009 petition was dismissed, but the 2014 \npetition was dismissed in 2017 for failure to make three months of payments under the \nbankruptcy plan. While Applicant was a federal employee she had $197.50 deducted \n1 Items 3-4. \n2 Items 2, 4-11. \n3 AE A. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom her paycheck twice a month.

Applicant claims she entered into a payment agreement with the IRS to \npay her federal tax debt. As proof of this agreement, she supplied a notice letter from \nthe IRS dated April 18, 2018. The notice indicated that she owed $18,717; that her last \npayment was $0; and that next payment of $242 was due on May 1, 2018. Applicant \nfailed to provide documentation showing that she has made any payments to the IRS \nstarting in May 2018. As for her state taxes, she provided an installment bill from her \ntaxing authority dated July 30, 2018, which indicated that she had a remaining balance \nof $4,754 and her monthly payment of $96 was due on August 15, 2018. She failed to \nprovide documentation showing that she made her monthly payments beginning in \nAugust 2018.5 \nCollection Accounts. SOR \u00b6 1.h: In February 2019, the creditor offered to settle \nthis debt with Applicant for approximately $1,600 with monthly payments of $75. \nApplicant failed to document that she accepted the offer or made any payments. SOR \u00b6 \n1.i: Applicant disputes this utility debt. She claims she was serviced by another \ncompany at the time of this alleged debt. She formally disputed this debt through a \ncredit reporting service. SOR \u00b6 1.j: Applicant documented that this medical debt was \npaid in August 2016. SOR \u00b6 1.k: Applicant claims this debt was included in her 2014 \nChapter 13 bankruptcy and she was making her required payments until the case was \ndismissed. She did not provide documentation showing any payments since the  \nChapter 13 dismissal. SOR \u00b6 1.l: Applicant claims her payment on this debt was \naffected by not timely receiving her retirement payments. She claims she will make $20 \nmonthly payments on this account, but she failed to document any payments so far. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: Applicant claims her payment on this debt was affected by not timely \nreceiving her retirement payments. She claims she will make $10 monthly payments on \nthis account, but she failed to document any payments so far.6 \nCharacter Evidence. Applicant presented statements from seven co-workers \nand colleagues. In her former government position, she occupied a position of trust as a \npretrial services officer. Her co-workers recognized her as a professional and \ntrustworthy employee. They noted her dedication to her job and her great integrity.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n4 Items 7-11; AE A. \n5 Item 4; AE A. \n6 Item 2; AE A. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary  \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple bankruptcy filings over the years demonstrate her inability \nand unwillingness to pay her debts. She has federal and state tax debt, and other \ndelinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of these mitigating conditions fully apply. Except for two debts, Applicant\u2019s \ndebts are recent and remain unresolved. She has filed five bankruptcy petitions since \n1991, with the most recent in 2014. Her federal and state income tax debt remains \nunresolved. She did not provide sufficient evidence to show that her financial problems \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s delayed receipt of her \nmonthly retirement pay may be considered a condition beyond her control, however, \nshe failed to take responsible actions to address her tax and other debts. I find AG \u00b6 \n20(b) partially applies. Except for one debt, Applicant also failed to address her SOR \ndebts through payments or establishing payment plans. There is no evidence of \nfinancial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. Aside from one debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i), Applicant failed to document any disputed debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) partially applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s previous \nfederal employment and the recommendation of her co-workers and colleagues. \nHowever, Applicant has not established a track record of financial stability.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.7 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST\n \nAPPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.j: \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \n \n \n \nFor\n \nApplicant\n \n \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n7 I considered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, \ndated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \n7 \n",

On December 7, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and E \n(personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn February 8, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn June 5, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and on June 6, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor June 26, 2019.  Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three Government Exhibits (GE \n1-3) and Applicant offered the three exhibits that were attached with his SOR response, \nwhich I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. There were no objections and \nall proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. I held the record open until July 26, \n2019, in the event either party wanted to submit additional documentation. On July 7, \n2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. No other documents were received, \nand on July 26, 2019, the record closed.  \n \n Request for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the Federal Republic of Iraq. Applicant did not object, and I have taken notice of \nfacts contained in the documents.  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he is seeking employment overseas as a linguist.  \nHe was born in Iraq, and in 2009, he immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 22 with his \nparents, three brothers and a sister. His father had been a driver for the United Nations, \nand felt threatened by local insurgents for speaking with a U.S. member of the United \nNations. Applicant lives with his parents, sister, and two brothers, and they became \nnaturalized U.S. citizens in 2014. Applicant is a dual citizen of Iraq and the U.S. He \nattended college in the U.S., and in 2016, he earned an associate\u2019s degree in business \nmanagement. Applicant is not married and does not have any children. He is currently \nemployed as a merchandiser for a beverage company. His government contractor \nemployment as a linguist is contingent on obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 21-\n26, 37-39, 42; GE 1, GE 2) \n \nThe SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant maintains contact with various aunts, uncles \nand cousins who are citizens and residents of Iraq. In March 2016, Applicant returned to \nIraq for vacation. He used his Iraqi passport to enter Iraq, and he renewed his Iraqi \nidentification card while visiting. He stayed in Iraq just under four weeks with extended \nfamily members. He has five uncles, three aunts, and three cousins. He maintains \nregular contact with these family members on approximately a monthly basis. Applicant \nwas uncertain if his uncles were employed by the Iraqi Government. He would like to \nreturn to Iraq in the future for vacation. His Iraqi passport expired in September 2016, \nand Applicant stated he had no intentions of renewing this passport. (Tr. 26-31, 34, 50-\n51, 53; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; AE A, AE C)  \n \nThe evidence in the record contained conflicting statements made by Applicant. \nDuring his September 2017 background interview, Applicant stated that he had no plans \nof renouncing his Iraqi citizenship. In September 2017, however, he presented a signed \nstatement from his potential DOD employer indicating that he was willing to renounce \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nhis Iraqi citizenship. During his November 2017 security-screening interview, he stated \nhe would not renounce his Iraqi citizenship because he wanted to continue visits to Iraq. \n(Tr. 35-42; GE 2, GE 3; AE D) \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant reportedly stated that he was uncertain if he would \nstay in the U.S. since Iraq is his home and he believes Iraq will someday be a better \nplace to live. His intentions were to maintain his Iraqi and U.S. citizenships, but he \neventually planned to live in Iraq in the next five to ten years. When initially asked which \ncountry he is more loyal to, Applicant responded with Iraq. He later changed his \nresponse and stated that he is loyal to the U.S. first, but still considers himself loyal to \nIraq because that is the country where he was born and raised. (Tr. 35-42; GE 2, GE 3; \nAE D) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied stating in November 2017 that he was more \nloyal to Iraq than the U.S. He believed the interviewer misunderstood his responses. He \ntold her to change some of his recorded responses that were incorrect, but she did not \ndo so. He denied stating that he wanted to live in Iraq, but mentioned instead that he \nwanted to visit Iraq in the future for vacation. Applicant admitted that he continued to \nmaintain his dual citizenship. (Tr. 35-42; GE 2, GE 3; AE D) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his September 2017 SCA by failing to \nreport his foreign relatives in Iraq, as required. At the hearing Applicant denied \nintentionally omitting this information on the SCA. He misunderstood the question and \nthought he was only to report any connections to foreign organizations or governments \nthat were a threat to the U.S. During his September 2017 background interview, the \ninterviewer asked Applicant if he had ongoing contact with any foreign nationals, and he \nresponded \u201cNo.\u201d During his November 2017 security-screening interview, Applicant \nprovided detailed information about his extended family members in Iraq. (Tr. 31-33; GE \n1, GE 2, GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified his September 2017 SCA \nby failing to report that he renewed his Iraqi identification card in 2016. In September \n2017, Applicant provided the investigator his Iraqi identification card during his \nbackground interview. Applicant also provided a copy of his Iraqi identification card with \nhis SOR response. It was not his intent to intentionally omit this information on the SCA. \n(GE 1; AE 2; SOR response) \n \nIraq \n \n \nThe U.S. mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership \nwith Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq \nmarked a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, \nstable, and self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the U.S. in the region as \nwell as a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East. Iraq has functioning \ngovernment institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly \nconstructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \npre-Saddam production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains \nvigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and \nsecurity issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement. \n \nThe Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the U.S. provides \nthe basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral issues \nincluding political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, \nenergy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, education, and \nenvironment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating \nCommittee and several Joint Coordination Committees, which meet periodically. \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current \ntravel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.  \n \nThe ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens \noutside Baghdad is limited given the security environment. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and \nattacks by improvised explosive devices (IED) occur in many areas of the country, \nincluding Baghdad. Methods of attack have included explosively formed penetrators \n(EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines \nplaced on or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various \ndirect fire weapons. Such attacks may take place in public venues such as cafes and \nmarkets.  \n \nIraq witnessed continued terrorist activity in 2016, primarily as a result of the \nactions of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL). In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest \nterrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number \nof foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL\u2019s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically \neroded in the past two years. According to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission \nfor Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more \nthan 12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory \nfrom ISIL, drastically reducing ISIL\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human \nrights violations continue to be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other \nabuses being made against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.  \n \nIn its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nsevere human rights problems were widespread. Sectarian hostility, widespread \ncorruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened \nthe government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections. Iraqi \nSecurity Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some \nhuman rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization \nForces killing, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIL committed the \noverwhelming majority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: \ncivilians, (particularly Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other \nreligious and ethnic minorities; women; and children. \n \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \nObservers also reported other significant human rights-related problems: harsh \nand life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; arbitrary arrest and \nlengthy pretrial detention, denial of fair public trial; insufficient judicial institutional \ncapacity; ineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; arbitrary \ninterference with privacy and homes; child soldiers; limits on freedom of expression, \nincluding press freedoms; violence against and harassment of journalists; undue \ncensorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \nlimits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom \ndue to violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and \ninternally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs \nfrom returning home; discrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, \nreligious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; \ntrafficking in persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due \nprocess; and limitations on worker rights. \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Iraq is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and Iraq \ngovernment problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top national \nsecurity goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and \nsupport of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Guideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant admitted his aunts, uncles and cousins are residents and citizens of \nIraq, and he maintained approximately monthly contact with them. His frequent contacts \nwith relatives in Iraq are manifestations of his care and concern for relatives living in that \ncountry.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Iraq is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq, the nature of its government, \nits relationship with the United States, and its human rights record, all of which are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion or duress is markedly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or \ndependent on the government, the country conducts intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq because of \nterrorists and criminals. Thousands of United States and coalition armed forces and \ncivilian contractors serving in the Middle East are targets of terrorists, along with their \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \nfamilies. Numerous linguists, supporting U.S. forces, have family living in countries that \nhave continuing issues with terrorists. The relationship of Iraq with the United States, \nand the situation in that country places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant \nto demonstrate that his relationships with any family member living in Iraq does not \npose a trustworthiness or security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position \nwhere he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire \nto assist a relative living in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s extended family members in Iraq \u201ccould be a means through which \nApplicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or technology and \nwho would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, 2015)). His \nrelationships with relatives who are living in Iraq create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause terrorists could place pressure on his family in an effort to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department \nCounsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Iraq \nand has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any \nmitigating conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists the following conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security \nconcerns including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nApplicant maintains regular and continuing contact with his uncles, aunts and \ncousins in Iraq. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d There are conflicting statements in \nevidence that Applicant is more loyal to Iraq than the U.S., and that he intends to return \nto Iraq to live in the near future. In 2016, he chose to use his Iraqi passport instead of \nhis U.S. passport when he entered Iraq for vacation, and he also renewed his Iraqi \nidentification card during his visit with extended family members. \n \nApplicant has close relationships with extended family members in Iraq, and they \nare at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations from that country\u2019s \ngovernment. Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically \nadd risk to his relatives living in Iraq. In sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives \nliving in Iraq are too significant to mitigate in the circumstances Applicant presented. His \nconnections to the United States taken together are not sufficient to overcome the \nforeign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during national security investigative \nor adjudicative processes. \u2026 \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable under the established facts in this \ncase: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant failed to list his foreign relatives and his possession of an Iraqi \nidentification card he renewed in 2016 on the SCA he completed in September 2017. I did \nnot find the omission intentional. The above disqualifying condition does not apply.  \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant has consistently stated that the SCA questions were confusing to him, \nand that he did not intentionally omit relevant and material information when he filled out \nthe security clearance paperwork in September 2017. During his background interview \nthat same month, he brought his Iraqi identification card with him to show the DOD \ninvestigator. During his security-screening interview, Applicant brought detailed \ninformation about his Iraqi extended family members. I noticed during the course of the \nhearing, many questions needed to be repeated or rephrased so Applicant could \nunderstand the question. The evidence supports that he made good-faith efforts to \nprovide the information only after he fully understood the need to report the information. \nHis failure to initially provide relevant information happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it does not cast doubt on the Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he is seeking employment overseas as a linguist.  \nIn 2009, he arrived in the U.S. with his parents, a sister, and three brothers. In 2014, he \nbecame a U.S. citizen. He is a dual citizen of Iraq and the U.S. \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with his extended family members, who are \nresidents and citizens of Iraq. Frequent contacts with relatives in a foreign country are \nmanifestations of one\u2019s care and concern for those family members. There is no \nevidence that his relatives are current employees of a foreign government or foreign \nmilitary personnel. His relationship with his extended family members in Iraq are \npositive character traits; however, they raise important foreign influence security \nconcerns. Connections to a foreign country must be balanced against connections to \nthe United States.      \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there. Iraq is dangerous due to on-going violence \nfrom terrorists, and the government does not respect the full spectrum of human rights. \nTerrorists continue to threaten the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, \nand those who cooperate and assist the United States.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude personal conduct security \nconcerns are mitigated; however, foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He and his wife have been married for five years. He has three children, ages 27, 21, and 16, from prior relationships, and a 16-year-old stepson. Applicant joined the Navy after high school, and served for 20 years, from 1989 to 2009. He retired as a petty officer second class (E-5). He held a clearance during his entire Navy career.

He did not provide sufficient information to \nmitigate personal conduct security concerns, which relate to falsifications about his \nillegal drug use and involvement during the security clearance process. Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

DOHA received the \ntranscript on January 2, 2019.  \n \n Findings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a-2.c, and 2.e-2.h, all with explanations. \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 2.d, also with an explanation. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He and his wife have been married for five years. He \nhas three children, ages 27, 21, and 16, from prior relationships, and a 16-year-old \nstepson. Applicant joined the Navy after high school, and served for 20 years, from \n1989 to 2009. He retired as a petty officer second class (E-5). He held a clearance \nduring his entire Navy career. (Tr. 43-47, 52-54, 74, 76, 147-148; GE 1; GE 3; \nAttachments (Att.) B & H to GE 9)  \n \n \nAfter retiring from the Navy, Applicant was a full-time student at a community \ncollege for about a year (2009-2010). During that time, he was unemployed. He worked \nat a computer help desk for two defense contractors in 2010 and 2011. He spent much \nof the next two years (2011-2013) working in Afghanistan supporting U.S. military \nforces. (GE 1; Att. B to GE 9) \n \nApplicant returned from Afghanistan in December 2013, when his employer\u2019s \ncontract ended. He was then unemployed from about January to March 2014. He was \nbriefly employed from March to June 2014, and was then unemployed again until \nOctober 2014. Since then, he has worked for his current employer, in the field of \ninformation technology. (GE 1) He does not currently hold a clearance. (Tr. 159-160) He \nearns $45,000 annually, and gets $1,200 a month in retirement pay. (Tr. 46-49, 51-52, \n144-145; GE 1; Attachment (Att.) B to GE 9)  \n \nAfter he left the Navy, Applicant used marijuana on social occasions with friends \nabout seven times between November 2009 and November 2014. (Tr. 93-94, 114-115; \nGE 1; Answer). He used marijuana twice in late 2009, while in school after leaving the \nNavy; several times between January and May 2014, and once at a wedding in \nNovember 2014. He also purchased marijuana on one occasion, in mid-2014. (GE 10-\n11, 16) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) His marijuana use occurred after he had been granted a security \nclearance. (SOR \u00b6 1.b)  \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nIn connection with his employment, Applicant submitted an SCA for a high-level \nclearance with another government agency (AGA) in August 2014. (GE 5) He did not \ndisclose his marijuana use or the one-time marijuana purchase, all of which occurred \nwithin the previous seven years, the timeframe of the questions at issue. (GE 5 at Q. 23; \nTr. 100-106) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.c)  \n \nAt the same time, Applicant signed an acknowledgement concerning his \nunderstanding of AGA policy that drug use was illegal. (GE 6) He last used marijuana in \nNovember 2014, at a wedding. (GE 3 at 10-11) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n \nApplicant submitted another SCA, in October 2014 for a job with another defense \ncontractor. (GE 2). He again failed to disclose his usage and purchase of marijuana, in \nanswering questions that called for disclosure of that information. (GE 2 at 33; Tr. 100-\n106). (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e. 2.f)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, which Applicant admitted, alleges that Applicant used marijuana after \nhe had been granted a security clearance. He had a clearance in the Navy, and all of \nhis marijuana use came afterwards. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.g, which Applicant also admitted, \nconcern his alleged failure to disclose, on both of his SCAs in 2014, that he used \nmarijuana while possessing a security clearance. (GE 2 at 33; GE 5 at Q. 23b) \n \nDepartment Counsel represented on the record that the DOD\u2019s Joint Personnel \nAdjudication System (JPAS) indicated that Applicant\u2019s clearance was \u201cdenied\u201d on June \n29, 2015. (Tr. 74, 146) (See discussion below). However, there is no official \ndocumentation in the record, either from JPAS or otherwise, about whether Applicant in \nfact held a clearance, or was working in a cleared position, when he used marijuana at \nany time.  \n \n \nOn December 2, 2014, Applicant had a background interview for the clearance \nwith the AGA. He initially denied any involvement with illegal drugs. After further \nquestioning, he admitted using marijuana at social gatherings twice in 2009 (after \nleaving the Navy) three or four times between January 2014 and May 2014, and once in \nNovember 2014. He also disclosed his one-time purchase of marijuana, in March 2014. \n(GE 4 at 2; GE 7 at 6; Tr. 100, 121-122) \n \n \nFour days later, on December 6, 2014, Applicant had another interview with an \nAGA representative. In that interview, he disclosed only two uses of marijuana: once \neach in 2009 and 2014. He denied any further involvement with illegal drugs. (GE 4 at \n2; GE 8 at 2; Tr. 121-122) His failure to disclose the full extent of his illegal drug use in \nthe December 6 interview is alleged as SOR \u00b6 2.h. \n \n \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana and related false statements on \nhis August 2014 SCA and during subsequent background interviews, the AGA denied \nApplicant eligibility for access in a June 2015 clearance decision statement (CDS). \nUnder the drug involvement guideline, the AGA applied the drug involvement \ndisqualifying condition for \u201cany drug abuse.\u201d The AGA\u2019s decision did not address \nwhether Applicant\u2019s drug use, either in 2009 or 2014, had occurred while he held a \n\n4 \n \nclearance. (GE 4) Applicant appealed the denial and had a hearing. (Tr. 73-74; GE 9) \nThe AGA upheld the denial on appeal in September 2015. (GE 10)  \n \nApplicant submitted his most recent SCA in July 2016. He disclosed that he used \nmarijuana about seven times on social occasions between 2009 and November 2014. \nHe also disclosed his one-time purchase of marijuana, in 2014. He disclosed that his \nclearance had been revoked in June 2015 for failing to disclose his drug use. He also \ndisavowed any future drug use because he said he did not want to put his clearance in \njeopardy or put his livelihood at risk. He acknowledged that his prior drug use had been \na mistake (GE 1) He discussed his drug use in background interviews in September \n2016 and January 2017. (GE 3 at 10-11, 16) He testified that his intentions in disclosing \nhis drug use was to be \u201cone hundred percent honest\u201d going forward, and to \u201ccome clean \nabout everything.\u201d (Tr. 112, 136)  \n \nConcerning the single drug purchase, Applicant purchased a $10 bag of \nmarijuana on one occasion in either March 2014 (GE 1 at 37; GE 3 at 17) or a few \nmonths later. (Tr. 97; GE 3 at 11) He kept the bag of marijuana in his garage. He initially \ntestified that he had the bag \u201cmaybe a month.\u201d (Tr. 98). He also testified \u201conce my \nclearance got revoked, and I found out what I got revoked for, I got rid of it.\u201d (Tr. 96-98) \nOnce it was pointed out to Applicant at hearing that his clearance was revoked in late \nJune 2015, he admitted keeping the marijuana in his garage for about 15 months, \ninstead of only one. (Tr. 122-129) \n \nApplicant said in his September 2016 background interview that he did not \ndisclose his marijuana use on his earlier applications out of fear that doing so would \nimpact his eligibility for a clearance. He decided later to admit to his use since lying \nabout it was too much of a burden and that he wanted to do the right thing. (GE 3 at 10) \n \n \nIn 2013, while working in Afghanistan, Applicant sent an unsolicited personal e-\nmail to a female Marine he worked with. The e-mail was not well received, and she \ncomplained to his supervisor. (Tr. 49-51, 89-93; GE 7 at 3) In SOR \u00b6 2.d, the \nGovernment alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose on his October 2014 \nSCA that he had been reprimanded or disciplined as a result of this incident. (GE 2 at \n12-13; GE 3 at 9, 15; Tr. 117-120) Appellant denied SOR \u00b6 2.d, on the grounds that he \nhad not been given a written reprimand or otherwise disciplined as a result of the e-mail. \nHe acknowledged being told by his supervisor not to contact the woman again, and he \ncomplied. (Tr. 113) He denied being given a reprimand, written or otherwise. There is \nno written reprimand in the record.  \n \nApplicant disclosed this incident on his most recent SCA, in 2016. (GE 1 at 16) \nHe said he did so to clear his conscience, and out of the abundance of caution. (Tr. \n120)  \n \nIn 2007, Applicant was a petty officer first class (E-6) and a leading petty officer \n(LPO) in charge of about 17 other sailors on his ship. In applying for chief petty officer \n(E-7), Applicant submitted documentation falsely representing that he had obtained \ncertain qualifications necessary for promotion. On the documentation, he forged or \nfalsified his senior chief petty officer\u2019s signature. He submitted the documentation to the \n\n5 \n \nvery senior chief whose signature he had forged, and she noticed the discrepancy right \naway. Applicant was charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with \nmaking a false statement. He received non-judicial punishment (NJP) and was reduced \nin rank to E-5. He was allowed to remain in the Navy so he could retire after 20 years. \n(Tr. 78-88, 141-144; GE 8 at 3) This incident is not alleged in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant disclosed his NJP on his July 2016 SCA. He did so despite the fact that \nit occurred in 2007, and, thus, need not have been disclosed, since it was beyond the \nseven-year time frame of the employment questions on the form. (GE 1 at 20-21) \n \nIn late August 2018, following a recommendation from his doctor, Applicant \nbegan attending counseling with a licensed clinical social worker (LSCW). (AE A) He \nattends counseling and has his medication evaluated every three months. (Tr. 132-135) \nApplicant testified that he accepts full responsibility for his actions and is very \nremorseful. His counselor noted this as well. (AE A) He sought counseling so as to put \nthings behind him and \u201cget my life back together.\u201d (Tr. 71-72, 158; Answer) He accepted \nfull responsibility for his actions and said he has learned his lesson. (Tr. 158; AE A) \n \n \nIn 2015, when he appealed the denial of his clearance application with the AGA, \nApplicant submitted a statement of intent not to use illegal drugs in the future, and he \nconsented to automatic revocation of his clearance should he do so. (Att. E to GE 9) \nApplicant reaffirmed that statement during his testimony. (Tr. 135) \n \n \nA former co-worker of Applicant\u2019s testified as a character witness. They worked \ntogether from October 2017 at October 2018 and had daily professional contact. She \nattested to Applicant\u2019s honesty and integrity. She trusts Applicant implicitly, which she \nrarely does with others. If she owned her own business, she would hire him. (Tr. 51-69) \n \n \nTwo senior executives at Applicant\u2019s employer praised his work ethic and \nprofessional expertise. They regard Applicant as motivated, responsible, and a devoted \nemployee. They stated that he has a high degree of integrity. They are aware of \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct, and noted that he is remorseful and regretful. They believe \nApplicant made a mistake and has faced up to it. They recommend Applicant for a \nclearance. (AE B; AE C) Applicant\u2019s security manager provided a similar strong \nendorsement, as did a longtime friend and fellow sailor. (AE D; AE E)1 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d2 \n \n                                                          \n1 I also considered the recommendation letters provided in 2015, when Appellant appealed the denial of \nhis eligibility for a clearance with the AGA. (Att. A to GE 9) \n \n2 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n  \n\n6 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \n\n7 \n \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nMarijuana is a Schedule 1 drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Use and \npossession of marijuana are illegal under federal law. Applicant used marijuana on \nseveral occasions between November 2009 and November 2014. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nHe purchased a $10 bag of marijuana at some point in mid-2014. AG \u00b6 25(c) applies.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges, and Applicant admits, that he used marijuana after having \nbeen granted a DOD security clearance. However, for AG \u00b6 25(f) to apply, Applicant \nmust be shown to have used illegal drugs while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred after he left the Navy. He used it twice \nin late 2009, shortly after he retired. While his Navy clearance may have been \u201ccurrent\u201d \nat the time, Applicant was also unemployed and taking classes. He joined the defense \nindustry in 2010. He used marijuana several times after returning from Afghanistan (in \nDecember 2013), between about January 2014 and May 2014. During part of this \nperiod, he was unemployed, and during part of this period, he was employed in the \ndefense industry. Thus, it is not entirely clear from the record that any of these incidents \nof marijuana use occurred during periods when he was employed in a cleared capacity.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent marijuana use was in November 2014, at a wedding. \nThis was after he signed an acknowledgment of his understanding that drug use was \nillegal, in August 2014, after submitting SCAs, in August and October 2014, and after \nbeginning work for his current employer. While he had recently applied for a clearance, \nit is not clear from the record that he had one at the time, notwithstanding his \nadmissions. \n \nMost importantly, notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admissions, there is no \ndocumentary record evidence to confirm that Applicant had a clearance during any of \nthe times when he used marijuana, either in 2009 or 2014. In particular, the CDS from \n\n8 \n \nthe AGA does not address whether Applicant used marijuana with a clearance \u2013 \nsomething which one assumes the AGA would address in the CDS if they had \nsupporting record evidence. I find that there is insufficient record evidence to apply AG \n\u00b6 25(f). \n \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana with friends, both at home, and in other social \nsituations. There is little evidence that he has disassociated himself from his drug-using \nassociates, or changed the environment where drugs are used. Applicant provided a \nstatement of intent in 2015, and reaffirmed it at his hearing. AG \u00b6 26(b) therefore \npartially applies.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana twice in 2009 and several times in 2014, about seven \ntimes in total. He purchased marijuana on one occasion in mid-2014, and kept it in his \ngarage until after his clearance was denied, in June 2015. After that, he disposed of it. \nThus, Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana continued until about three and a half \nyears before the hearing. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was, nonetheless, infrequent. He \nhas not used marijuana since November 2014. He has expressed remorse and regret \nsince then, in counseling, to his supervisors, and at hearing. Additionally, he has \nalready had a security clearance denied, in part because of his drug use. Thus, he is \nwell aware of the consequences of future involvement with illegal drugs. For that \nreason, I conclude that Applicant is unlikely to use illegal drugs in the future. I find that \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n\n9 \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, . . . determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, [or] \nsecurity official, . . . in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \n \nApplicant submitted two SCAs, and had a related background interview, for a \nclearance with the AGA in 2014. He deliberately failed to disclose his marijuana use and \nhis one-time purchase of marijuana. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.c, 2.e, and 2.f.  \n \nDespite being more candid about his drug use in a background interview only \ndays earlier, Applicant deliberately underreported his drug use (acknowledging only two \nincidents) in his December 6, 2014 interview with the AGA representative. AG \u00b6 16(b) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 2.h.  \n \nAs discussed in Guideline H, above, there is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat any of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred \u201cwhile possessing a clearance.\u201d Since \nthat is not established, it is also not established that Applicant deliberately falsified the \nquestions on his August and October 2014 SCAs, calling for disclosure of illegal drug \nuse \u201cwhile possessing a clearance. Thus, notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admission, there \nis insufficient evidence to conclude that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to either SOR \u00b6 2.b or \u00b6 2.g. \nThose allegations are found for Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d is not established. Applicant sent an unsolicited e-mail to a female \nMarine in 2013. The e-mail was unwelcome, and she complained to his supervisor. \nApplicant was told to break off contact with the woman, and he did so. He denied \nreceiving a written warning, or official reprimand, suspension or discipline at work as a \nresult. There is no written reprimand in the record. Applicant had no duty to disclose the \nincident on his October 2014 SCA (or on his 2016 SCA, even though he did so). AG \u00b6 \n16(a) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 2.d. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline E: \n  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n\n10 \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant had multiple opportunities in 2014 to be fully candid about his drug use.  \nHe prepared two SCAs, in August and October 2014. He had used marijuana several \ntimes earlier that year, and knew that his recent use might affect his clearance eligibility. \nHe then used marijuana in November 2014, after acknowledging the AGA\u2019s policy about \nillegal drug use and agreeing to abide by it.  \n \n \nApplicant had a background interview on December 2, 2014 with an AGA \nrepresentative. He initially denied any involvement with illegal drugs. After further \nquestioning, he admitted his use and purchase of marijuana, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  \n \n \nFour days later, he underreported his drug use, acknowledging only single uses \nof marijuana in 2009 and 2014. He denied any further involvement with illegal drugs. \nApplicant has a duty to be truthful and candid with the Government at all times. Prior \ndisclosures do not mitigate subsequent omissions. The fact that he had disclosed his \nmarijuana use only days before, does not mitigate this minimization. \n \n \nApplicant was most fully candid about his illegal drug involvement on his 2016 \nSCA, and subsequently. However, this subsequent candor does not constitute \u201cprompt, \ngood-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has admitted his prior misconduct, and has expressed remorse and \nregret for his actions. He recently entered counseling, and is participating actively and to \nhis benefit. Applicant is therefore given some credit in mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, are not minor. They are also not \nisolated. Though they are now several years old, they are also part of a pattern of poor \njudgment and lack of candor. This is evidenced not only by the multiple falsifications \nalleged in the SOR, but by the false official statement Applicant made in the Navy.  \n \n \nWhile not alleged, that prior instance of falsification is appropriate for \nconsideration in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person concept. In 2007, \nwhile serving in the Navy as an LPO and with a clearance, Applicant falsified \nqualification documents necessary for his promotion to chief petty officer. He did so in a \nparticularly foolish way \u2013 by falsifying the signature of his supervisor, to whom he then \nhanded the document. Not surprisingly, he was caught. This led to a charge under the \nUCMJ of falsifying an official document. Applicant was reduced in rank to E-5, the rank \nat which he retired a few years later.  \n\n11 \n \nAs I told Applicant at hearing,3 this incident cannot be considered as disqualifying \nconduct since it was not alleged in the SOR. However, it is appropriate to consider this \nincident in weighing mitigation or changed circumstances, whether Applicant has \ndemonstrated sufficient rehabilitation, under the whole-person concept, and in weighing \nApplicant\u2019s credibility.4  \n \nApplicant\u2019s falsification in the Navy is now many years old, but, coupled with his \nfalsifications on his 2014 SCAs and during his 2014 interview, it weighs heavily against \nmitigation. Applicant\u2019s falsifications, as alleged, are part of a pattern, and are not \nisolated. They are not attributable to a lack of maturity or a failure to understand the \nseriousness of the process. In light of the multiple falsifications in this case, including \nthe unalleged prior, similar conduct, I cannot conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) fully \napply in this case to mitigate the security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s pattern of \nsecurity-significant personal conduct.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana several times, but infrequently, several years ago. \nSecurity concerns over his drug involvement is mitigated. However, Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence that he has mitigated personal conduct security concerns \nover his multiple falsifications.  \n \n                                                          \n3 Tr. 140-141.  \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \n \n\n12 \n \nThis is not a case about punishing Applicant for his prior transgressions. This is a \ncase about whether or not Applicant is a security risk, and whether he has carried his \nburden of establishing that he is again a suitable candidate for access to U.S. \nGovernment classified information. Applicant has a long record of falsifications, going \nback to his Navy service. Multiple falsifications were alleged in the SOR and established \nin the record. The fact that Applicant has belatedly chosen to be more fully candid on \nhis most recent SCA, has expressed remorse and regret for his prior falsifications, and \nhas pursued counseling, is simply not enough to mitigate security concerns over his \nsuitability for a clearance. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 5, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 13, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 19, 2019. The Government offered \n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There \nwere no objections to any of the exhibits offered, and they were admitted into evidence. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript on April 30, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibit I, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Iraq. Applicant did not object, and I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported by source \ndocuments from official U.S. Government publications.1 The facts are summarized in the \nFindings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and denied 1.d \nand 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. He was born in Iraq and graduated from high school \nthere in 1989. He was conscripted into the Iraqi Army and went through basic training. He \nhad an option to work in a factory for ten years instead of military service. He chose to \nwork in the factory and did so until he fled to Jordan in 1998. He worked there for a year \nbefore returning to Iraq in 1999. He testified that he paid a bribe to be released from his \nfactory contract. He was then self-employed.2  \n \nApplicant married in 2002. He has three children, ages 16, 14 and 11, who were \nall born in Iraq. From 2003 to 2006, he worked for the United States Government in Iraq. \nFrom 2007 to 2010, he worked as an interpreter for United States military forces in Iraq. \nHe served with the forces until there was a drawdown, and he was laid off.3 \n \nApplicant provided letters of recommendations from some of the U.S. military \npersonnel with whom he served in Iraq from 2007 to 2010. He was praised for his service \nand guidance on cultural matters. It was noted he was dedicated to his duty and \ncompletely devoted to the mission of securing and rebuilding Iraq. He was excellent at \nhis job and a consummate professional. The letters also reflected that Applicant \nparticipated in daily patrols in high threat areas and combat operations, which put him \nconsiderable risk to his safety and security. He was responsible for tactical questioning \nof suspected insurgents and translation of confiscated documents. He assisted \nimmeasurably in communication with the Iraqi local nationals and Iraqi Security Forces. \n                                                          \n1 Source documents are attached to Hearing Exhibit I. \n \n2 Tr. 18-22; GE 1, 2. \n \n3 Tr. 18-22, 73-79. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDespite these constant threats, he served the U.S. forces with distinction.4 One of the \nletters stated the following:  \n \n[Applicant] was an invaluable asset to 1st Platoon during his three-month \ntenure. He enabled the successful conduct of over 150 combat operations \nin [city] and [city] Iraq. His mastery of the English language and \nunderstanding of the local dialect, customs, and idioms provided a \nseamless link between Coalition Forces and the local populace, supporting \nboth combat and stability operations. Furthermore, his ability to translate \nthe United States Army\u2019s technical jargon into terms Iraqi Security Forces \ncould understand was essential for rapid commands on the battlefield.  \n \n[Applicant] has an unparalleled work ethic. The difficult missions and long \nhours involved in translating for a United States Army Infantry platoon \ndemand only strong, skilled, responsible men. [Applicant] is a prime \nexample of such a man.5 \n \nIn 2010, Applicant and his family immigrated to the United States as refugees. \nApplicant had applied for a Special Immigration Visa (SIV) because of his service to the \nUnited States Government. He had already immigrated and was living in the United \nStates with his family when an SIV was approved, so he chose to not change his \nimmigration status. He attempted to enlist in the American military because he liked \nworking with them. He was told he was too old. In July 2016, he became a naturalized \ncitizen of the United States. He testified that after he became a U.S. citizen, he applied to \nwork as a linguist Iraq.6  \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in 2006. Applicant returned to Iraq to visit his \nmother in 2012, 2014, and 2018. Applicant maintains close contact with his mother, and \nspeaks with her by phone regularly. He does not know her exact age, but she is at least \nin her 90s. He has three sisters. His mother lives with two of his sisters and two nephews. \nApplicant communicates with them when he calls his mother. One sister is single and the \nother is a widow. His single sister works as a technician. His widowed sister works in a \nfactory. His mother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. His widowed sister \nhas two sons, one who is a severely handicapped teenager. They both live with her. His \nnephew contacts Applicant regularly due to the isolation caused by his disability. \nApplicant\u2019s third sister is also a widow who has six children. Applicant was unsure if any \nof them live with her, but thought perhaps one did. She is a citizen and resident of Iraq \nand supports herself with her husband\u2019s pension. He last saw her in 2014 and has \noccasional social media contact.7 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 80. \n \n5 AE A. \n \n6 Tr. 22-27, 79-80; GE 1, 2. \n \n7 Tr. 27-33, 41-48; GE 1, 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers, one is a permanent resident of the United States and \nthe other is a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant sponsored his brother, his brother\u2019s \nwife and their one minor child for immigration to the United States. Their other children \nwere over 18 years old and remained in Iraq. Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s wife is also a \npermanent resident. Applicant\u2019s other brother is married with children. He is a citizen and \nresident of Iraq. He is a tailor. Applicant sometimes communicates with him through social \nmedia. Applicant visited him during his last visit to Iraq in 2018, but had not seen him for \nmany years before that.8  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Iraq. She contacts them \nregularly. She has returned to Iraq twice to visit, once with the children. She works in a \nrestaurant. She sends her parents money. Her father is not employed. In about 2013, \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s brother died from an improvised explosive device. He was in the Iraqi \nArmy, but was not on duty at the time. Her father receives the brother\u2019s pension. She also \nhas another brother and three sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. His wife \nintends to visit her family in Iraq in the future.9  \n \nApplicant testified that he has a big family and most of his contact with them is \nthrough social media and consists of a casual greeting. He believes some of his relatives \nare jealous that he is now an American citizen. He has told them to stop contacting him \non social media. He does not have anything in common with them anymore. Applicant \nhas many nieces, nephews, and cousins. He disclosed that one of his nephews is a police \nofficer with the Iraqi National Police. Another nephew works with the Iraqi public works \ndepartment. He did not know his specific job. They are all citizens and residents of Iraq. \nHe contacted some of his relatives when he was completing the security clearance \ndocuments so he could obtain accurate information. Some were aware he was applying \nfor a job with the United States Government, but not the specific job, or that he may be \nreturning to Iraq.10  \n \nIn 2010, before Applicant immigrated to the United States, he sold a house that \nwas co-owned by family members. The proceeds were split among the siblings. His \nmother and two sisters wanted to purchase another house. Before Applicant\u2019s father \npassed away, he told Applicant to take care of his mother and sisters. Applicant took his \nshare of the profit he earned on the sale of the house, which was $22,000, and loaned \nthem $18,000, so they could purchase the new house. They put his name on the deed of \nthe house. They intended to repay him, but Applicant knows they are unable to repay him \nand he considers it a gift to them. He asked them to sell the house so his name could be \nremoved from the deed or to take his name off the deed, so it would not cause \ncomplication. They do not want to sell the house because they need stability for the \nhandicapped teen. Applicant testified that he financially helps his sisters and mother if \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 33-41; GE 1, 2. \n \n9 Tr. 48-54; GE 1, 2. \n \n10 Tr. 54-60, 84-85; GE 1, 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthey need it. He said that he has applied for his one sister and two nephews to immigrate \nto the United States.11  \n \nIn 2013, Applicant purchased a house in the United States, which cost about \n$94,000. He owns two vehicles. He has a checking and savings account in the United \nStates with assets of about $10,000. He had a bank account in Iraq, but it was dormant \nfor more than five years and was closed by the bank. He stated that his life is in the United \nStates. He considers the United States his country and is not loyal to any other.12 \n \nIRAQ \n \n \nThe United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of \nthe U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad is \nextremely limited given the security environment. ISIS controls a significant portion of \nIraq\u2019s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the Iraqi government has little or no ability \nto control and ensure public safety. \n \n \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such \ngroups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias \nmay also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. U.S. \nGovernment and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.  \n \n \nThe U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under \nstrict security guidelines.  \n \n \nThere are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that \nhave weakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights \nprotections. Iraqi security forces and members of the Federal Police have committed \nhuman rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. There are \nalso problems that include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison \nfacilities, arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits \non freedom of expression, freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful \nassembly, and societal abuses of women. ISIS is also responsible for human rights \nabuses. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \n                                                          \n11 Tr. 61-66. \n \n12 Tr. 66-71. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation;  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e), and 7(f) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d necessary to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The \ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie \nmust be considered.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, three sisters, and his wife\u2019s parents are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. He has other extended family members who are also citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. Applicant has ties of affection to many of them. He maintains regular \ncontact with his mother and his two sisters who live with her and his nephews. He has \n\n \n8 \n \n \ninfrequent contact with other relatives. Applicant\u2019s family residing in Iraq creates a \nheightened risk and a potential foreign influence concern.  \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq \nbecause of continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. \ncitizens. It also has serious concerns about terrorist activities in Iraq that specifically target \nAmericans. There are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq because of \nterrorists and insurgents. Applicant has supported the U.S. Government through his work \nas a translator and linguist and is willing to do so in the future. Numerous linguists, \ntranslators and advisors supporting U.S. forces, have families living in Iraq. Thousands \nof the U.S. and coalition armed forces and civilian contractors serving in Iraq are targets \nof terrorists, along with Iraqi civilians, who support the Iraq Government and cooperate \nwith coalition forces.  \n \nThe mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person, who is a \ncitizen and resident of a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, depending on the facts and circumstances, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment; the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties; a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government; the \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a substantial amount of \ndeath or property damage; or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States. The relationship of Iraq with the United States, and \nthe situation in Iraq place a significant, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his relationships with his family members living in Iraq do \nnot pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative \nliving in Iraq.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives or terrorists from Iraq seek \nor have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, \nnevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable state \nintelligence services, and Iraq has an enormous problem with terrorism. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationships with relatives living in Iraq create a potential conflict of interest because \nterrorists could place pressure on his family living there in an effort to cause Applicant to \ncompromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Substantial \nevidence was produced of Applicant\u2019s contacts with family in Iraq and has raised the issue \nof potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant owns a shared interest in a house where his mother and two sisters live. \nHe loaned them money, and they put his name on the deed of the house. They are unable \nto repay the loan. He considered the loan a gift and does not expect repayment. Based \non Applicant\u2019s financial interests and ties in the United States, I find his financial interest \nin the house nominal and does not raise a heightened risk of foreign influence or create \na personal conflict of interest. I find AG \u00b6 7(f) does not apply. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, sisters, parents-in-law and other relatives are citizens \nand residents of Iraq. He maintains a close relationship with some of them and not others. \nHe talks with his mother regularly and often with his sisters and nephews living with her. \nHe has visited them in past years. He has had infrequent visits with relatives and talks to \nthem infrequently during the year. Applicant\u2019s contact with his family is infrequent, but not \ncasual. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant worked for the United \nStates Government from 2003 to 2006. He then served on dangerous missions and \ncombat operations with U.S. military forces from 2007 to 2010. He immigrated to the \nUnited States and was subsequently granted an SIV after he arrived. In 2017, he applied \nfor a job to return to serve with U.S. military forces in Iraq. Applicant became a U.S. \ncitizen, bought a home, and lives in the United States with his immediate family. He has \nfinancial assets in the United States. His brother and family also live in the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s years of supporting the United States military in Iraq as a linguist, \nincluding the dangers that service entailed, weigh heavily toward mitigating security \nconcerns. He hopes to continue to support the United States\u2019 goals in Iraq. He is loyal \nand committed to the United States. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand resident of Iraq. Like every other resident of Iraq, any of his relatives who may be \nliving in Iraq are at risk from terrorists. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant has one brother who is a tailor in Iraq. He has infrequent contact with \nhim. He has two nephews who have contacts with government entities in Iraq. One is in \nthe police force and another works with a ministry department. He has ongoing contact \nwith his mother, two sisters, and two nephews. He has limited contact with other relatives. \nHis wife has regular contact with her parents in Iraq. I have considered all of these \ncontacts. In doing so, it is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge investment \nof manpower and money in Iraq, and Applicant\u2019s support for the U.S. goals and objectives \nin Iraq. Applicant and his family living in Iraq are potential targets of terrorists, and \nApplicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to his \nrelatives living in Iraq from lawless elements in Iraq.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s possible future connections to his relatives living in Iraq are less \nsignificant than his connections to the United States. His employment in support of the \nU.S. Government, financial interests and bonds to the United States, performance as a \nlinguist to U.S. forces, and U.S. citizenship are important factors weighing toward \nmitigation of security concerns. Based on Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding relationship, \nand proven loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the United States. His connections to the United States taken together \nare sufficient to fully overcome and mitigate the foreign influence security concerns under \nGuideline B.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant worked for the United States Government in Iraq from 2003 to 2006. He \nthen served as a linguist from 2007 to 2010, actively supporting the U.S. military mission \nin Iraq in dangerous operations. He understands the risks associated with having family \nin Iraq. Based on Applicant\u2019s past commitment and service under combat and hostile \nconditions and his demonstrated continued loyalty to the United States, he has mitigated \nthe foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Leon J. Schachter, Esquire \n \n05/07/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn September 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing  \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence and Guideline C, Foreign \nPreference. The action was initially taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017. \n  \n \nOn October 22, 2018, Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 14, 2018. The case was assigned to me on February 12, 2019. On February \n13, 2019, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for March 28, 2019. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered six  \nexhibits. Government exhibits 1-5 were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel \nobjected to the admission of Gov 6 on the basis of paragraph E3.1.20 of the Directive. \nGov 6 was not admitted. Applicant offered nine exhibits, which were admitted as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 H, without objection. The Government and the Applicant \nrequested administrative notice be taken of certain facts regarding the country of Iraq. \n\n2 \n \nThe administrative notice documents were marked as Administrative Notice Document I \n(Admin Not I) and Admin Not II. The transcript was received on April 11, 2019. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \nAdministrative Notice  -  Iraq  \n \n \nA coalition of countries led by U.S. and British forces invaded Iraq on March 20, \n2003. Dictator Saddam Hussein was deposed and on May 12, 2003, the United States \nestablished the Coalition Provisional Authority as the interim civil authority in Iraq. About \none year later, the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred sovereignity to the new \nInterim Iraqi Government led by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi. Throughout the governance \nof the Coalition Provisional Authority and the peaceful transfer of power, the role of Iraqi \ninterpreters was vital to U.S. military success. Recognizing the role of local Iraqi \ninterpreters \u2013 and the dangers they faced as a result of their assistance to the United \nStates \u2013 Congress authorized a \u201cSpecial Immigrant Visa\u201d program that allowed local \ninterpreters who served with distinction to immigrate to the United States. (Admin Not II) \n \n \nSince 2005, the U.S. government has approved more than $18.6 billion worth of \nforeign military sales to Iraq. U.S. security assistance supports the development of a \nmodern, accountable, and professional Iraqi military capable of defending Iraq and its \nborders. U.S. security assistance programs also promote civilian oversight of the \nmilitary, adherence to the rule of law, and the respect for human rights, while \nsimultaneously increasing the Iraqi military\u2019s capability to respond to threats and \ncounter-terrorism operations. The U.S. Embassy Baghdad maintains the Office of \nSecurity Cooperation \u2013 Iraq to further these goals and to facilitate Iraq\u2019s role as a \nresponsible security partner, contributing to the peace and security of the region. \n(Admin Not ll)   \n \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The outcome of the 2014 \nparliamentary elections generally met international standards of free and fair elections \nand led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to \nPrime Minister Haider al-Abadi. (Admin Not 1) \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very \ndangerous and the ability of the U.S. Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely \nlimited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups \nregularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also \nthreaten U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. (Admin Not 1)  \n \n \n \nSevere human rights problems are widespread in Iraq. Sectarian hostility, \nwidespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society \nweakened the government\u2019s authority and worsened effective human rights protections. \nProblems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities; \narbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to \ninclude press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; \ndiscrimination against and societal abuse of women and ethnic, religious, and racial \n\n3 \n \nminorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. \n(Admin Not 1)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old linguist employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor since August 2017. He is currently stationed overseas. He is applying for a \nsecurity clearance. He became a U.S. citizen in May 2016. He was born, raised, and \neducated in Iraq. He received a college degree in Iraq. He is single and has no children. \n(Gov 1; AE F) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, \nnames of witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. \nThe cited sources contain more specific information.)  \n  \nForeign Influence \n \nBetween April 2004 and February 2011, Applicant served as a local hire with the \nU.S. government in Iraq. He started out as a security guard in the Green Zone. In 2007, \nhe became a linguist. From December 2008 to October 2009, he served as an \ninstructor. He worked with U.S. trainers who were training Iraqi police. From December \n2009 to February 2011, he worked as a linguist. Applicant often encountered danger \nwhile working in Iraq as a U.S. contractor. He testified that the base would experience \nmortar attacks on a weekly basis. He had to be situationally aware when he left the \nbase because assassination groups were watching any vehicles that left the base. He \ntook security precautions such as keeping his badges under his shoe cushion and \ntraveling different routes every day. He told his friends and family that he was working \nas a security officer at the ministry of industry. In February 2011, he immigrated to the \nUnited States with the help of the U.S. government and the International Organization \nfor Migration, an organization that helps Iraqis who work for the U.S. government in Iraq \nto immigrate to the United States in order to protect them from the risk of violence. (Tr. \n50-54; Gov 1; AE B; AE D; AE E)  \n \nWhen he first arrived in the United States, Applicant worked for a temp agency. \nIn November 2011, he found a full-time job working for a large on-line retailer in a \nwarehouse. In December 2015, he was promoted to supervisor. In August 2017, he \nbecame a linguist overseas with a U.S. contractor. He initially deployed to a middle-\neastern country (not Iraq) with the U.S. Army.  In January 2019, Applicant was \ntransferred to a linguist position in another middle-eastern country (not Iraq). He \ndecided to become an overseas linguist again out of gratitude to the United States for \nallowing him to become a U.S. citizen. He saw it as an opportunity to serve his new \ncountry. (Tr. 50-54; Gov 1; AE B; AE F)  \n \nThe SOR raises security concerns because Applicant has family members who \nare citizens of and reside in Iraq. Specifically, Applicant\u2019s mother, three brothers and \nthree sisters are citizens and residents in Iraq. (SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6 1.b). His oldest  \nbrother also serves as a senior officer in the Iraqi military. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) Applicant admits \nthe allegations. His mother is 74. She is a housewife. She lives in a house with one of \nApplicant\u2019s sisters. Applicant\u2019s oldest sister is seven years older than him. She is a \nhousewife. Another sister is a teacher. She is five years older than Applicant. His third \n\n4 \n \nsister is three years older than him and is a housewife.  His sisters and his mother are \nnot connected to the Iraqi government. (Tr. 39-41, 47-48, 58) \n \nApplicant has two older brothers. His oldest brother is 14 years older than him. \nApplicant\u2019s younger brother is a sergeant in the Iraqi military. He is four years younger \nthan Applicant. His middle brother is a radiologist who works at a hospital. Applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are not aware that he works for the U.S. government. He tells them that \nhe works for a private company. (Tr. 43-46; Gov 1; Gov 3, 4, 5)  \n \nApplicant provided information about his family members, each time he \ncompleted a counter-intelligence update when he was employed with DOD contractors \nwhile he was a citizen of Iraq. His family members raised no issues at the time. (Tr. 60; \nGov 3, 4, 5) \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder the Foreign Preference concern, it is alleged that Applicant used his Iraqi \npassport in lieu of the U.S. passport to enter and exit the United States in April 2017.   \nApplicant testified that he used his U.S. passport to exit and enter the United States \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen in May 2016.  He admits that he used his Iraqi passport to \nenter and exit Iraq even though he had a U.S. passport. He used the Iraqi passport \nbecause he did not need a visa and it was easier to go through the security lines at the \nIraqi airport.  Since that trip, Applicant renounced his Iraqi citizenship and surrendered \nhis Iraqi passport to his facility security officer in April 2017. I find for Applicant under the \nsecurity concern under Foreign Preference, because he no longer possesses an Iraqi \npassport. Under the new guidelines effective on June 8, 2017, the possession of a \nforeign passport does not raise security concerns as long as Applicant informed his \nfacility security officer. (Tr. 66-69; AE H)  \n \n  \nWhole-person Factors  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s dream was to become a U.S. citizen. He has established a life here. \nHis bank accounts are located in the United States. He owns stock. He bought a car in \nthe United States. He has friends in the United States. He saved up $83,000 in hopes of \neventually purchasing a home in the United States. He attempted to sign up for the \nselective service, but was advised he was not required to because of his age. He is \nregistered to vote in the United States. In September 2018, he received a performance \nbonus based on his performance and conduct during the first year of his current linguist \ncontract.  (Tr. 55-57; AE A; AE C \u2013 AE F) \n \n \nIn 2010, he received a Longevity Award, for his exemplary performance and \ndedication to duty while serving as a linguist. (AE E) Several of his co-workers provided \nletters attesting to his trustworthiness and reliability.  A former co-worker, who has \nknown Applicant for 12 years, states Applicant is \u201cvery respectful and dedicated to his \nwork and the people that worked with him.\u201d He said Applicant described the United \nStates as \u201cthe best place on earth!\u201d (AE G)  \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n   \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern under Foreign Influence:   \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign  country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b) apply. The mere possession of \nclose family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country \nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); \nISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant\u2019s mother, three brothers and \nthree sisters are citizens of and reside in Iraq. This creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of Iraq\u2019s serious \nhuman rights problems, and its issues with terrorism. The government of Iraq has made \nsome progress, but a heightened risk remains. Applicant\u2019s family in Iraq also create a \npotential conflict of interest between his obligation to protect classified information and \nhis desire to help his family members by providing that information. The risk is \nheightened further because one of Applicant\u2019s brothers is a senior officer in the Iraqi \nArmy. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nmitigating condition applies: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \n \nAt great risk to himself, Applicant worked for the U.S. government in Iraq from \n2004 to 2011 while he was an Iraqi citizen.  His efforts resulted in the U.S. government \ngranting Applicant permanent residency. Applicant immigrated to the United States in \n2011. He settled in the United States and found a good job. He became a U.S. citizen in \nMay 2016. Out of gratitude for being granted citizenship, Applicant became a contractor \nsupporting the U.S. government as a linguist. While previously working as contractor-\nlinguist in Iraq, he worked alongside U.S. forces under combat conditions. In ISCR Case \nNo. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as \nfollows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \n\n8 \n \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s longstanding commitment to the United States as well as \nhis favorable contributions to national security. He worked under dangerous conditions \nas a security guard and linguist for the U.S. government. His efforts resulted in him \nbeing granted permanent residency in the United States.  I find that Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is applicable. The security concerns under Foreign Influence are mitigated.  \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG & 9:       \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcern under paragraph 10. The following potentially applies in Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \nAG & 10(c): failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the \nU.S. \n           \n \nThe above disqualifying condition does not apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  During a \ntrip to Iraq after Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he used his U.S. passport to exit and \nenter the United States. He used his Iraqi passport to enter and exit Iraq. He fully \ndisclosed the use of his Iraqi passport to security officials at his present employer.  In \nApril 2017, he destroyed his Iraqi passport in the presence of his facility security officer. \nBased on the facts of this case, AG \u00b6 10(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s case. The \nForeign Preference concern is found for Applicant. \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n9 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s gratitude to \nthe U.S. government for accepting him as a refugee and granting him U.S. citizenship. I \nconsidered his support of the U.S. government overseas both before and after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen. Applicant hopes to earn enough income to purchase a home \nso that he can provide for his future family in the United States.          \n \nI considered the reference letters and awards indicating the valuable service  \nApplicant provided as a linguist for the U.S. government working on sensitive projects \nthat were vital to U.S. national security. The foreign influence and foreign preference \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.     \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the U.S. to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not mitigate the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns related to his history of misconduct and failure to disclose requested \ninformation during the security clearance investigation. Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn March 12, 2009, February 6, 2014, and December 6, 2017, Applicant submitted \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On November 27, 2018, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). On February 1, 2019, and \nFebruary 27, 2019, Applicant submitted answers to the SOR and requested that his case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nOn April 1, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. \nA complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 11 Items, was mailed \nto Applicant on April 2, 2019, and received on April 16, 2019. The FORM notified him that \nhe had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit a response \nto the FORM, submit additional material, or file objections to its contents. Items 1 through \n11 are admitted into the record. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me on June 20, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nI take administrative notice of facts concerning Afghanistan. Those facts are set \nout in the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice-Islamic Republic of \nAfghanistan, which I marked as Administrative Exhibit (AE) 1. The facts administratively \nnoticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The pertinent facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He was born in Afghanistan in 1963. He received his \neducation while living in Afghanistan. In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and \nin 1988, he received a certificate from a government college. After his father was killed \nby the Pakistani army, he fled to Pakistan in 1989 because he did not want to be \nconscripted into the Afghan army. He remained in Pakistan until 1992, when he entered \nthe United States as a refugee, along with his mother and siblings. He married an Afghan \ncitizen in 2006 while visiting Afghanistan. They divorced in 2009 in Afghanistan. He does \nnot have any children. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. (Items 4, 7, 9) \nApplicant\u2019s five siblings are U.S. residents and naturalized citizens. (Item 7) \n \n \nApplicant worked as a linguist for federal contractors in Afghanistan from March \n2009 to November 2009 and March 2011 to December 2012. He applied for another \nlinguist position in November 2017. He stated that he was granted a security clearance \nin 2009. In between those positions, he worked in construction or as a driver in the United \nStates. He was also unemployed at times. (Items 3, 5, 8, 9)   \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nApplicant admitted that his mother, age 86, is currently a citizen and resident of \nAfghanistan. She has lived there since 2013. Prior to that, she lived in the United States \nperiodically after she immigrated in 1992. He contacts her twice a week. (Items 2, 9 at \n21) In his answer to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied that one of his brothers-in-law \nis a citizen of Afghanistan. He stated that his brother-in-law recently moved to the United \nStates and lives with Applicant\u2019s sister. He does not know his brother-in-law\u2019s citizenship \nstatus. There is no information regarding how often Applicant contacts him or confirmation \nthat his brother-in-law now lives in the U.S. (Item 2)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant admitted in his Answer that he provides financial support for his mother, \nextended family, and friends. He sends money to friends to maintain his family\u2019s \nresidence in Afghanistan. His mother lives in that residence, which he estimated has a \nvalue of $80,000. He denied that he supports his former wife, as he previously disclosed \nin his 2017 e-QIP. (Items 2, 7, 9) In his December 2017 Counterintelligence Focused \nSecurity Screening Questionnaire (CFSSQ), Applicant stated that between 2009 and \n2013, he sent $500 to his cousin and also to a friend as gifts. He sent $6,300 to his \nbrother-in-law to help poor citizens and pay for Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s medical expenses \nwhile he was alive. (Items 6, 8) \n \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has a history of arrests, falsifying his 2014 and \n2017 e-QIPs, and engaging in misconduct related to his businesses. The allegations are \nas follows: \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.a) In 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with soliciting a prostitute. He \ndisclosed this information in his March 2009 Screening Questionnaire (SQ). He stated \nthat he talked to a prostitute for a cousin, who could not speak English. He was convicted \nand placed on probation for one year. (Item 7 at 7) In his Answer, he denied the allegation \nand said he did not recall the incident. (Item 2) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.b) Applicant denied that he was arrested and charged with aggravated \nharassment in November 2000. A state court record indicated that he pleaded guilty to \ndisorderly conduct and an order of protection was entered against him for one year. (Item \n11) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.c) In June 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated \nharassment, involving his previous girlfriend. He disclosed this information in his 2009 e-\nQIP and noted that the charges were dismissed. He admitted this allegation in his Answer. \n(Item 2, Item 3 at 39; Item 4 at 7)   \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.d) In October 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault. He \ndisclosed this information in his 2009 e-QIP and stated that he was charged with hitting \nhis 12-year-old niece in the face. The case was subsequently dismissed. Applicant \nadmitted this allegation in his Answer. (Item 2, Item 3 at 38, Item 4 at 7) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.e) In November 2009, a defense contractor terminated Applicant\u2019s \nemployment after they received an anonymous complaint that he was smoking hashish. \nApplicant was working in the Middle East at that time. (Item 10) Applicant denied that he \nwas using hashish and said he was \u201cframed\u201d by others. (Item 2)  \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.f) In December 2012, another defense contractor terminated Applicant\u2019s \nemployment after he tested positive for illegal drug use. (Item 10) Applicant denied that \nhe was terminated, but said he voluntarily left because his contract ended. (Item 7 at 20, \nItem 8 at 3) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n(\u00b6 2.g) In November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with obstructing \ngovernmental administration. Applicant denied the allegation. A court document \nconfirmed that he was charged and the case was dismissed. (Item 11)  \n    \n \n(\u00b6 2.h) In his Answer, Applicant stated he did not recall if he disclosed in his 2014 \ne-QIP his December 2012 termination for drug use, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f. He asserted \nthat he submitted many e-QIPs and other documents and said he disclosed that \ninformation in some of them. He denied the allegation regarding his drug use. (Item 2) In \nhis 2014 CFSSQ, he explained that he had a conflict with another employee, who reported \nhim as using hashish. He said he was dismissed by his employer without being given a \ndrug test. (Item 6 at 2) \n  \n \n(\u00b6 2.i) Applicant admitted that he was arrested in October 2008 and November \n2013, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.g. He said he did not disclose the arrests in his \n2014 e-QIP because both cases were dismissed. He denied that he falsified his 2014 e-\nQIP. (Item 2) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.j) During his January 2018 interview, Applicant stated that from December \n2014 until May 2016, he lived and worked in Afghanistan. He told the investigator that he \nand his brother-in-law, a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, started a business \npartnership, buying gas from Iran and shipping it to Afghanistan. Applicant said he \nregistered the business in his brother-in-law\u2019s name because as a U.S. citizen he was \nsubject to U.S. sanctions and prohibited from doing business with Iran. (Item 9 at 18) In \nhis Answer, he denied any wrongdoing and asserted that he was unfamiliar with the U.S. \nsanctions. (Item 2)  \n \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.k) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he was self-employed as a \nhomebuilder in the United States from January 2014 through November 2017, part of \nwhich time he claimed he lived in Afghanistan. (Item 7 at 18) During his January 2018 \ninterview, he stated that he did not register his U.S. business with the state or report any \nincome to the state or IRS. (Item 9 at 2, 18) In his Answer, Applicant denied these \nallegations, claiming he performed construction work as a hobby and not as a business. \n(Item 2) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.l) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that for the past ten years he resided \nin the United States from October 2012 to the present (December 2017). He failed to \ndisclose that he had resided in Afghanistan from December 2014 through May 2016. In \nhis Answer, he denied that he falsified information about his residency. He said that either \nhe or the person interviewing him in 2018 did not correctly insert the information into the \ne-QIP or other documents. (Item 2) He did not clarify the dates of his residency in \nAfghanistan in his Answer. \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.m) Applicant admitted that he did not disclose in his 2017 e-QIP the facts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f, relating to his job termination in December 2012 for using drugs. He \nasserted that he had submitted all relevant information numerous times about the \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ntermination and his drug test, and stated that he did not falsify information in the e-QIP. \n(Item 2) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.n) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose that he had a business partner \nor associate in Afghanistan, or had contacts with Iran within the past seven years, as \nrequested. He denied that he falsified his e-QIP because he claimed his brother-in-law \nwas not \u201can official business partner.\u201d (Item 2) \n \n \n(\u00b6 2.o) During the January 2018 interview, Applicant did not disclose that he had \nan employment problem with his former employer in December 2012 and was terminated \nfor testing positive for drug use, as alleged in \u00b6 2.f. He denied that he deliberately withheld \nthe information and asserted that he was confused by the interviewer\u2019s questions. (Item \n2)  \n \nAfghanistan \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning the state of Afghanistan. Specifically, Afghanistan faces \nmany challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are \nincreasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, \nand the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be \navoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights situation; the active and \nhostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and \nextremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military \nforces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. (AE 1) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \neligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DOD after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \n\n \n \n \n \n7\ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nAfghanistan has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate \nopenly and contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close connections to his \nmother, extended family, and friends living there create a significantly heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \nApplicant has ongoing connections with his mother, extended family, and some \nfriends, all of whom are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. He periodically sends \nmoney to them. These relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because terrorists and insurgents in Afghanistan seek intelligence \nor engage in behaviors that are hostile to the United States\u2019 interests. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with those people creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and his desire to help family \nmembers living in Afghanistan. The evidence is sufficient to raise a disqualification under \nAG \u00b6 7(b).  \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on these facts: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nConsidered in light of the substantial anti-western insurgent and terrorism threats \nin the region, Applicant did not demonstrate that it is unlikely he could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government \nand those of the United States due to his family ties there. He has legitimate and \nappropriately close relationships with his mother, family members, and friends living in \nAfghanistan, and a strong interest in protecting those people. His communication and \ncontact with them, in addition to his financial support, are sufficiently frequent that his \ninteractions cannot be considered casual nor infrequent. Accordingly, he failed to \nestablish the mitigating conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) as to the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.  \n \nThe evidence also fails to establish significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has some connections to the United States: he \nis a U.S. citizen and resident; his five siblings are citizens and residents of the United \nStates; and he has worked in various positions since arriving in the United States in 1992. \nHowever, those connections do not outweigh his connections to Afghanistan where he \nwas born, raised, and established a business for a number of years. His mother, with \nwhom he has a close relationship, is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, as are some \nfriends and extended family members. Applicant also moved back to Afghanistan and \nlived there for two years after becoming a U.S. citizen. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s U.S. ties are so deep and longstanding that he can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interests involving family or friends in Afghanistan in favor of the \nU.S. interests. Accordingly, he did not fully mitigate the security concerns raised under \nthis condition. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. They include: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,   \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while legal \nthere, is illegal in the United States. \n \nApplicant deliberately falsified or concealed relevant facts in his 2014 and 2017 e-\nQIPs as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h, 2.i, 2.m, and 2.n. He deliberately falsified or concealed \ninformation in his 2017 e-QIP about where he lived for the past 10 years, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.l. The evidence established security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a), as to those \nallegations. Applicant deliberately provided misleading information to an investigator \nduring his January 2018 interview, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.o. The evidence established \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 16(b). \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, \nand 2.g. He was terminated from two positions for using illegal drugs as alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f. Applicant failed to report income from his business to the state or the IRS, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k. This pattern of personal misconduct, when considered as a \nwhole, raises questions about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The evidence established security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16(c). \n \n \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j, between December 2014 and May 2016, Applicant lived \nin Afghanistan where he started a business with his brother-in-law, a citizen and resident \nof Afghanistan. They purchased gas from Iran and shipped it to Afghanistan. Applicant \nregistered the business in his brother-in-law\u2019s name because, as a U.S. citizen, he could \nnot legally engage in business with Iran. His personal conduct creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation by a foreign entity or other individuals and establishes a security concern \nunder AG \u00b6 16(e)(3).  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to support a disqualifying condition for the allegations \nraised in SOR \u00b6 2.i. Applicant credibly asserted that he did not disclose two arrests in his \n2014 e-QIP because both cases were dismissed.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and include five \nthat could potentially apply: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n\n \n \n \n \n11 \nApplicant did not make prompt efforts to correct his omissions or falsifications. \nThere is no evidence that he was advised to provide false or inaccurate information in his \ne-QIPs or during his interview. Applicant has not acknowledged his falsifications or \nmisconduct and has not taken steps to assure the Government that similar behavior is \nunlikely to recur. His explanations for falsifying information are not credible and individual \ninstances of misbehavior did not occur under unique circumstances. None of the listed \nmitigating conditions apply to any of the SOR allegations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):   \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts \nand circumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and personal conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1: Guideline B:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline E:  \n \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.h:           Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.j through 2.o: \n  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 4, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on March 19, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 7, 2019.  The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A and B, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant called one witness \n \n\n \n2 \n \nand testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nMay 15, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of Iraq.  Department Counsel provided a seven page summary of the facts, \nsupported by sixteen Government documents pertaining to Iraq, identified as \nGovernment Exhibit 4.  The documents provide elaboration and context for the \nsummary.  Applicant had no objection.  I took administrative notice of the facts included \nin the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and married with three adult children.  He has a \nMaster\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is applying for a position as a Linguist \nwith a defense contractor.  A security clearance is required in connection with this \nemployment.  He currently works for a different defense contractor as a Senior Network \nEngineer, where a security clearance is not required.      \n  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq.  After high school, Applicant was \nsponsored to attend college by the Iraqi Ministry of Defense.  By agreement with the \nMinistry of Defense, they paid for Applicant\u2019s education, and he in turn was obligated to \nserve in the Iraqi military indefinitely.  From January 1979 to October 1984 Applicant \nattended the military academies in two European countries, where he obtained his \nBachelor\u2019s and Master\u2019s degrees.  Applicant was then committed to serve in the Iraqi Air \nDefense Force, where he served from October 1984 until October 2003, nineteen years.  \nHe retired at the rank of a Colonel.  (Tr. pp. 75 -76.)   \n \n \nIn 2003, the country of Iraq was in great turmoil and there was no structured \ngovernment.  Applicant left the military, escaped the danger in Baghdad, and brought \nhis wife, who he married in 1988, and their three children to the United Arab Emirates \nas a temporary refuge.  Iraq was not safe for them anymore.  Applicant explained that \nbecause he is a Shiite and his wife is a Sunni, they were no longer welcome in Iraq.  \nApplicant lived in the United Arab Emirates until 2009, when he was granted political \nasylum and came to the United States.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n2015.  His wife and adult children were all born in Iraq.  They came to the United States \nin 2007, and became citizens of the United States in 2015.  (Tr. pp. 69-70.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n      \nApplicant has a number of friends and family members who are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq.  He has maintained contact with several Iraqi citizens who attended \nthe military academy with him.  Two of the individuals became high ranking officers in \nthe Iraqi military.  Applicant met these individuals as classmates of his during the time \nhe attended the Iraqi military academies.  One of the individuals is now a member of \nparliament.  Since leaving Iraq in 2003, Appellant has on occasion contacted his school \nfriends through facebook, but has no regular contact with them.      \n \n \nApplicant also has a substantial number of family members who are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq.  His family in Iraq includes four sisters, two brothers, four brothers-in-\nlaw, four sisters-in-law, two cousins, and other family.  Five of his six siblings are either \nretired form service to the Iraqi government or currently working for the Iraqi \ngovernment.  The other family members have also worked for the Iraqi government or \nthe Iraqi military.  Applicant maintains contact with some of his relatives by internet \ntelephone between five and ten times a year.  (Tr. p. 94.)  Others only four to six times a \nyear.  (Tr. p. 91.)  When he calls them, he calls them all.  (Tr. p. 91.)  Applicant last \ntraveled to Iraq in 2014.  That is the last time he physically saw his family members.  He \nstates that he has no plans to move back to Iraq.  (Tr. p. 108.)      \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter, who represented him at the hearing, and who works for the \nU.S. Navy as an engineer, and holds a security clearance herself, testified on the \nApplicant\u2019s behalf.  She stated, among many laudatory remarks, that her father is \nreliable, dependable and trustworthy.  (Tr. pp. 24-26.) \n \n \nAfter becoming a United States citizen, Applicant received a retirement pension \nfrom Iraq for several years.  To orchestrate receipt of his pension check, Applicant\u2019s \nbrother in Iraq would pick up the check, and wire it to the Applicant in the United States.  \nApplicant testified that he received about $200 bi-monthly from the Iraqi government for \nseveral years.  Applicant testified that in 2014, he gave his brother power of attorney, \nand signed his pension over to his brother, who now receives it and uses it to care for \none of their sisters who is experiencing financial hardship.  (Tr. p. 79-80.)     \n \n \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s senior manager reflects that the Applicant is an \ninstrumental team member in support of their mission.  He is a well-qualified network \nengineer who has been an asset to their organization.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n \n \nApplicant has also earned a number of awards and certifications for work-related \ncourse work that have continued to enhance his engineering abilities.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit B.)   \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice concerning the country of Iraq.  Iraq is a \nconstitutional parliamentary republic.  It is a dangerous place for a citizen of the United \nStates.  U.S. citizens are targets for terrorist attacks and violent atrocities directly linked \nto terrorist organizations in Iraq.  The Iraqi government declared all of its territory \nliberated from ISIS in December 2017, however despite improved government control, \nISIS remains a threat to public safety in Iraq through the indiscriminate use of terrorist \nand asymmetrical attacks.  Due to the terrorism and armed conflict the U.S. Department \n\n \n4 \n \nof State travel advisory advises that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence, \nkidnapping and unlawful killings.  Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in \nIraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians.  Anti-U.S. sectarian \nmilitias may also threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq.  \nAttacks by improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur frequently in many areas of the \ncountry including Baghdad.  The U.S. Government\u2019s ability to provide routine and \nemergency services to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited.  The U.S. Government \nconsiders the potential personal security threats to U.S. Government personnel in Iraq \nto be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines.  \nIraq is in political turmoil and conflict as it struggles to rebuild, reconstitute the Iraqi \nstate, maintain pressure on ISIS and rein in the Iranian-backed Shia militias that pose \nan enduring threat to U.S. personnel.  (Government Exhibit 4.)   \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n5 \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members include his four sisters and two brothers, four \nbrothers-in-law, four sisters-in-law, and two cousins, who are citizens and residents of \n\n \n6 \n \nIraq.  Applicant\u2019s contact with them is regular, casual and not out of the ordinary.  \nHowever, based upon the large number of family he has, he is in consistent contact with \nthem.  Given their contacts with the Iraqi government, they can threaten or influence \nApplicant\u2019s choice of interest as a naturalized United States citizen.  Most of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily in some form or fashion have worked in the past, or are currently working for the \nIraqi government or the Iraqi military.  This strong ongoing contact raises some serious \nsecurity concerns.  Under the particular circumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is \napplicable, and this contact poses a security risk to the U.S. government that is not \nnecessary.  This is a situation that may manipulate or induce the Applicant to help a \nforeign person or government in a way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests.  \nApplicant has subjected himself to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest from his connection with his relatives and friends in Iraq.  \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nThe foreign contacts with his family and friends in Iraq clearly pose a security \nrisk.  Many members of the Applicant\u2019s family, as well as the Applicant himself have \nbeen, or are currently associated with, the Iraqi government.  Although Applicant is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen now, his close and ongoing relationships with his family in Iraq \nand his close association with the Iraqi government can result in a divided allegiance.  \nFull mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has not been established in regard to his \ngovernment association and family members and friends in Iraq.  Applicant\u2019s foreign \nrelationships poses a heightened security risk particularly relevant to this proceeding.   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s many Iraqi familial and government and foreign connections pose a \nsignificant risk to the U.S. government.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, \nthis regular ongoing contact with foreign nationals does create an unnecessary security \nrisk not worth any benefit to the U.S. government.      \n   \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINT APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Thompson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n07/02/2019 \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant, a naturalized U.S. citizen, failed to mitigate the security concerns \nraised by her ongoing contact with family members who are citizens and residents of \nRussia and the Ukraine. She also failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nOn August 24, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a security clearance \napplication (SCA). On November 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nas amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.     \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant a security clearance \nfor Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). \n \nOn December 19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a \nhearing. On January 25, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for March 21, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE). Applicant \ntestified, but did not provide any documents. I admitted all proffered exhibits into \nevidence without objection. I also held the record open for one month in the event either \nparty wanted to submit additional documentation. (Tr. 41) On April 1, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing. On April 15, 2019, Applicant timely submitted \nseveral documents, which I labeled as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-C, and admitted into \nevidence without objection. The record closed on April 21, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Russia and the \nUkraine. Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of facts concerning \nRussia and the Ukraine, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. Department \nCounsel and Applicant indicated they had no objection to me taking administrative \nnotice of facts from the U.S. Department of State website. (Tr. 41) Administrative or \nofficial notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See \nISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at \n4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well \nknown or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 \n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j and \n2.l. She also provided mitigating information in a written statement. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  \n \nThe Government has requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Russia and the Ukraine. Therefore, I make the following findings of fact:  \n \nRussia has a highly centralized, weak multi-party political system dominated by \nthe president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on \ncivil liberties, discrimination, denial of due process, forced confessions, torture, other \nprisoner mistreatment, and the government\u2019s failure to prosecute officials who commit \nserious violations. Government officials also engage in electronic surveillance without \nproper authorization. Russia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nespionage against the United States, focusing on obtaining proprietary information and \nadvance weapons technologies beneficial to Russia\u2019s military modernization and \neconomic development. Russia\u2019s intelligence services as well as private companies and \nother entities frequently seek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to \nRussia who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They \nalso have offered financial inducements to U.S. government officials and citizens to \nencourage them to compromise classified information. Russia\u2019s attempts to collect U.S. \ntechnological and economic information represent a growing and persistent threat to \nU.S. security. \n \nU.S. intelligence has also identified the Ukraine as an active perpetrator of \nindustrial espionage against the United States, often targeting individuals with ties to the \ncountry. In 2014, Russia seized and occupied Crimea in an effort to annex it, which \ncaused the United States to impose sanctions against those entities and individuals \nresponsible for the aggression. The conflict is ongoing. The U.S. State Department \nadvises U.S. citizens to avoid separatist-controlled areas of Ukraine, particularly the \neastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where separatist groups have detained and \nkidnapped U.S. citizens. The U.S. State Department has also warned U.S. citizens to \navoid all travel to Crimea due to the continued presence of Russian Federation military \nforces occupying the region as a de facto government and committing abuses against \nthe local population. The Ukrainian Government is known to commit human rights \nviolations, including government intervention on personal freedoms. Separatist groups, \npresent in several regions, are known to target U.S. citizens.  \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old linguist sponsored for a security clearance by a DOD \ncontractor since August 2017. Her employment as a linguist is contingent on her \nobtaining a DOD security clearance. In 1963, she was born and raised in Ukraine. In \n1983, she was married in Ukraine, and in 1995, she obtained a divorce in Russia. She \nhas a daughter, age 34, and a grandchild, age 6, currently living in Russia. In 1998, she \ngraduated from Moscow State Mining University with a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 1999, \nshe earned a master\u2019s degree in business administration. In 2004, she married a U.S. \ncitizen in Russia, whom she met online, and she emigrated from Russia to the United \nStates in 2006. In 2011, she became a naturalized U.S. citizen. She is currently \nemployed by a company working as a translator. Her workload is inconsistent, and her \nmonthly income averages approximately $1,200. She and her spouse live in separate \nhouseholds, and he does not support her financially. (Tr. 11-14, 52-53, 76, 80-81; GE 1)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s daughter is a citizen and resident of Russia. \nApplicant admitted this in her SOR response. Her daughter recently divorced her \nhusband. Applicant has asked her daughter to come to the U.S. on multiple occasions, \nbut her daughter is reluctant. Her daughter is employed as a purchaser for a privately-\nowned company. Applicant stated that she tries to communicate with her daughter by \nphone every week, but sometimes she is unsuccessful in getting ahold of her. She also \nuses the app \u201cWhatsApp\u201d and Skype frequently to communicate with her daughter. (Tr. \n59-63) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. allege that Applicant\u2019s sister and brother-in-law are citizens \nand residents of the Ukraine. Applicant admitted this in her SOR response. At the \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nhearing, she said that there was a time after their mother passed away, Applicant and \nher sister did not communicate for nearly two years. When Applicant was sick with \nlymphoma last year, she contacted her sister. They now communicate on an app called \n\u201cViber,\u201d and they talk to each other two-to-three times a week. Applicant asked her \nsister and her husband to come to the U.S., and she indicated there is a possibility they \nmay come for a visit. Her sister is a regional manager for about 20 small grocery stores, \nand her husband is a security guard. Neither of their jobs are connected to the \nUkrainian government. (Tr. 64-69) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant\u2019s friend is a citizen and resident of the Ukraine. \nApplicant admitted this in her SOR response. At the hearing, she said her friend was a \nneighbor while she was growing up. Her friend is elderly and helped take care of her \nmother after she suffered a stroke. Their contact now is infrequent. (Tr. 69-70) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant\u2019s friend is a citizen of Russian, residing in the \nRussian Embassy in Washington D.C. The friend\u2019s spouse was an employee of the \nRussian Embassy. Applicant admitted that the woman used to be her friend, but they \nterminated their friendship and they no longer have any contact. (Tr. 73) \n \n \nApplicant does not own any property in Russia or the Ukraine, and she has no \nplans to visit either country. She has never returned to either country since she arrived \nin the U.S. in 2006. (Tr. 73-75) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges unpaid financial obligations just under $20,000. Applicant \nattributes her financial difficulties from an abusive marriage, which required her to live \nseparate from her spouse. Her spouse was unemployed and he depleted their savings \naccount. She had difficulty obtaining employment despite her college education, and \nwas forced to accept jobs paying low wages, to include employment as a pizza delivery \ndriver, a house cleaner, and a home-healthcare aide. Applicant also suffered from \nmedical issues with her spine and lymphoma. (Tr. 15, 45, 48-50, 58) \n \n \nApplicant sent her mother $300 to $500 several times during 2010 and 2011. In \n2012, she could no longer afford to send money to her mother. When Applicant started \nworking as a linguist in 2015, she resumed sending money to her mother, and she also \npaid back a loan of $1,500 she borrowed from a friend. Applicant admitted she was \ndelinquent on her bills during the time she was sending money. She sent money \nbecause her mother was in poor health, and the money was needed to help pay for \nmedical care and medicine. Her mother passed away in August 2016. (Tr. 71-72) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges a personal loan account was referred for collection in the \namount of $8,480. This is the largest debt cited in the SOR. Applicant took out a \npersonal loan to pay off some of the delinquent credit cards. Her last payment on this \naccount was in about 2014. She has been unable to pay on this account since her \nwages are too low and her income is unstable. This debt is unresolved and unsatisfied. \n(Tr.42-43)  \n \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \n \nThe remaining SOR debts Applicant admitted in her SOR response, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-\n2.i, 2.k, and 2.m, and 2.n, are debts that she plans to pay eventually, but at the present \ntime, she is unable to make payments on these accounts due to irregular income and \nlow wages. Applicant promised to pay off her delinquent debts once she obtained her \nDOD security clearance. She would be employed with a higher income, and able to \nafford regular payments to her creditors. Currently these debts are unresolved and \nunsatisfied.  (Tr. 44, 79) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.j alleges that Applicant owes an apartment complex $581. She denied \nthis debt in her SOR response. Applicant was separated from her spouse and living in \nan apartment. He became very ill, and she allowed him to move into her apartment. The \nproperty manager noticed that she had an unauthorized resident, and three dogs, \ninstead of two dogs, which was in violation of her lease agreement. She was asked to \nvacate the apartment, which she did. Applicant later received a letter from the \napartment complex indicating she owed money due to pet stains and the odor of urine \ncoming from the carpet, which required the carpet to be replaced. She denied owing this \nmoney, and refused to pay this disputed debt. After the hearing, Applicant provided \nsome documentation showing her ongoing dispute with this creditor. This debt has not \nbeen resolved. (Tr. 44-47; AE C) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.l alleges that Applicant owes a townhome complex $71, for a past due \ndebt. She denied this debt in her SOR response. After the hearing, Applicant provided \ndocumentation showing she paid this debt in 2015. This debt is fully satisfied. (Tr. 47-\n48; AE B) \n \nOther documentation Applicant submitted showed that she settled a debt with a \ncollection agency in 2016. The delinquent debt totaled $1,079. The creditor requested \nApplicant pay $800, and they would close the account as settled. Applicant paid this \namount in 2016. I researched the account number on her documentation, but I could not \nfind this particular debt pertained to any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \n(AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n                                                Analysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, financial, \nand property interests, are a national security concern if they result in divided \nallegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create circumstances in \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nwhich the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nIn assessing the heightened risk created as a result of a security clearance, the \nApplicant\u2019s ties to a hostile country are important. However, even countries friendly to \nthe United States have attempted to gain unauthorized access to classified information. \nUnder the particular facts of this case, I have taken administrative notice of the \ninformation provided by Department Counsel. As noted, the Russian and Ukrainian \ngovernments are known to commit human rights violations, including government \nintervention on personal freedoms. Separatist groups, present in several regions, are \nknown to specifically target U.S. citizens. Given the ongoing conflict in Russia and the \nUkraine between the elected government and separatist groups and the potential \nthreats against U.S. citizens, Applicant\u2019s relationships with her family members in \nRussia and the Ukraine create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation and coercion \nand the potential risk for a conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing contacts with her daughter, grandchild, sister, and brother-in-\nlaw create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nclassified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information. There is a rebuttable \npresumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his or her immediate \nfamily members. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \n2017)). Another significant consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Russia and the Ukraine with the United States, and the situation in those \ncountries places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her \nrelationship with any family member living in or visiting those countries do not pose a \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where she might be forced \nto choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in \nor visiting Russia or the Ukraine. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. \nSept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant presented some important \nmitigating information. She has deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S. Applicant has resided in the United States since 2006, and she became a U.S. \ncitizen in 2011. She swore an oath of allegiance to the United States as part of the \ncitizenship process.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Russia and the Ukraine are substantial and ongoing. \nShe has frequent contacts with her daughter and sister, who are citizens and residents \nof Russia and the Ukraine, respectively. Applicant\u2019s frequent contacts with family \nmembers are manifestations of her care and concern for those family members. In sum, \nApplicant\u2019s connections to her relatives living in Russia and the Ukraine are substantial. \nHer connections to the United States taken together are insufficient to overcome the \nforeign influence security concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Applicant\u2019s 14 delinquent debts total approximately $20,000. These debts \nbecame delinquent in approximately 2012, and they remain delinquent. The \nGovernment produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (an inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n  \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. Her \ndebts became delinquent around 2012, and they remain delinquent. She has referenced \nfinancial hardships due to separation from her spouse without financial support, her \nunderemployment, and medical issues; which are conditions beyond her control. \nHowever, she has not provided sufficient information or documentation to establish the \nfinancial impact of these conditions beyond her control. More importantly, she must \ndemonstrate that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \n  \nApplicant has not provided any documentary evidence of a debt-resolution plan. \nShe promises to repay her creditors once she obtains consistent employment with \nhigher wages, but at the current time, she is unable to make payments to her delinquent \ncreditors. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without further confirmed action, are \ninsufficient. Applicant\u2019s failure to show that she has a defined plan to repay any of her \ncreditors continues to cast doubt on her judgment. Her financial issues continue to be a \nburden to her and there is no evidence it is under control. None of the financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old linguist. She is currently employed by a company as a \ntranslator, and her take-home pay averages about $1,200 per month. She is unable to \npay her delinquent debts, and her financial difficulties are not under control.  \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Russia and the Ukraine must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situation and dangers there. Applicant maintains frequent \ncontact with her daughter in Russia and her sister in the Ukraine. Frequent contacts \nwith family in foreign countries are a manifestation of one\u2019s care and concern for \nrelatives living in those foreign countries, and raise important foreign influence security \nconcerns.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence and \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.m and 2.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: J. Nathan Overstreet, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 27, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 31, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 18, 2018. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on the same \nday. I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 17, 2019. The Government offered \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) A through C. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 \nthrough 10. There were no objections to any of the exhibits offered, and they were \nadmitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 28, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibits I, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about Afghanistan. Applicant did not object, and I \nhave taken administrative notice of the facts contained in the request that are supported \nby source documents from official U.S. Government publications that were provided as \npart of the exhibit.1 The facts are summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He completed high school \nand college there. He is married and has six children, four girls and two boys. He served \nas an officer in the Afghan Army from 1980 to 1992. He served as an infantry instructor. \nIn 1992, the Afghan Army sent Applicant to Uzbekistan to attend law school. He moved \nthere with his wife and four children at the time. He earned a law degree. He does not \nmaintain contact with any members of the Afghan military.2 \n \nWhile living in Uzbekistan, Applicant and his wife had two more children, \ndaughters. During that period, Afghanistan was invaded by the Soviet Union, and \nApplicant could not return to his home country. In 2005, he and his family were granted \nasylum by the United States, left Uzbekistan, and immigrated to the United States. In \n2009, Applicant began working as a cultural affairs advisor and was employed by several \nfederal contractors until 2014, when he and many of the cultural advisors, were laid off. \nIn 2015, he opened a business with a friend. It was unsuccessful. In 2016, he went back \nto work for the U.S. Government, and has since been working as a linguist. He speaks \nfour languages. He was deployed to Afghanistan from April 2018 to January 2019. \nBecause of his duties with the U.S. Government, he did not visit his family during this \ndeployment.3  \n \nIn 2011, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s four eldest children, who \nwere born in Afghanistan, also became U.S. citizens in 2011. His two youngest children \n                                                          \n1 Source documents are attached to Hearing Exhibit I. \n \n2 Tr. 29-36, 96-98. \n \n3 Tr. 36-50, GE A. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbecame U.S. citizens in 2015, and his wife became a U.S. citizen in 2016. All of them \nhave U.S. passports. None have retained foreign passports or Afghan citizenship.4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s eldest son is mentally disabled. His other son works as a linguist for a \nU.S. military contractor in Afghanistan. He lives on a U.S. military base. He is married to \nan Afghan citizen, and they have one child.  \n \nIn 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife moved to Afghanistan. Two adult daughters and their \ndisabled son also moved back to Afghanistan with her. Because Applicant\u2019s wife, son, \nand two daughters had previously been citizens of Afghanistan, they were not required to \nobtain an Afghan visa, which is normally required. They do not possess any type of \nAfghan identification cards. Applicant testified that most people are unaware of his wife \nand children\u2019s citizenship status. However, some of her neighbors are aware that they \nare U.S. citizens. One daughter, who accompanied her mother, suffers from depression \nand was advised by her doctor to go with her mother to help improve her mental health.  \n \nApplicant testified that his wife moved back to Afghanistan for two reasons. First, \nhis elderly father needed care and secondly, their son and his wife lived there. His son\u2019s \nwife and child live in the same apartment as Applicant\u2019s wife. Due to his job, his son is \nrequired to live on base. Applicant\u2019s son provides his wife and son financial support. His \npaycheck is deposited directly into his bank account in the United States and then his \nyounger sisters, who have access to the account, wires money to his wife. Applicant\u2019s \nson\u2019s wife is an Afghan citizen.5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s other daughter who returned to Afghanistan, married in 2017. Her \nhusband, an Afghan citizen, has worked for a U.S. contractor in Afghanistan for about five \nyears. They have one child. Applicant testified that this daughter has applied for her \nhusband to come to the United States with her when she returns. It is unknown when she \nintends to return.6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s father died in October 2018. Applicant testified that his wife plans on \nreturning to the United States, along with their disabled son and daughter. They do not \nyet have plane tickets to return. Applicant is their sole source of financial support. \nApplicant\u2019s two youngest daughters, who are college students and live in the United \nStates, have access to their father\u2019s account. They wire money to their mother from their \nfather\u2019s account in the United States for her financial needs. Their mother retrieves the \nmoney by going to the transfer office and showing her U.S. passport. Applicant has not \nvisited his wife since 2017. He was not permitted to visit her or his children when he was \ndeployed to Afghanistan in 2018. He maintains contact with her by telephone.7  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 40-42, 98-100-101. \n \n5 Tr. 68, 100-109, 130-131-136.

They both intend on remaining in the United States after they \ngraduate from college. Applicant stays with them when he is the United States.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother predeceased his father many years earlier. Applicant did not \ninherit any property from his father. His father had 10 children with Applicant\u2019s mother \nand six children with his stepmother. Seven of Applicant\u2019s siblings are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan. The other three siblings live in Germany, India, and Australia. \nAll of his siblings living in Afghanistan are married and have children who also live there. \nOne brother is employed in the Afghan ministry of agriculture. The last time Applicant \nvisited this brother was in 2016. Applicant\u2019s wife visits Applicant\u2019s siblings sometimes \nbecause they live in the same city. Applicant does not have contact with his stepbrothers \nand stepsisters. He does not provide support to any of his siblings or step-siblings. \nApplicant has a brother-in-law who was a colonel in the Afghan military. He retired a \ncouple of years ago and receives a military pension.9  \n \nApplicant traveled to Afghanistan with his family in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to visit \nhis father and family. In 2017 he traveled there with his youngest daughters to visit his \nimmediate and extended family. They stayed for about a month. While there he visited \nsome siblings. He does not have contact his siblings throughout the year, but does when \nhe is in the country and visits them.10  \n \nIn about 2004, Applicant met an Afghan citizen when he lived in Uzbekistan. He \nhad a casual social acquaintance with him because they were both Afghans. They \ngreeted each other on three to four occasions, but they were not friends. In approximately \n2015, this person was appointed as the Afghan ambassador to Uzbekistan. When \nApplicant became aware of this person\u2019s appointment to ambassador, he sent him a \ncongratulatory note on Facebook. This was the extent of their contact.11 \n \nApplicant does not provide financial support to any family members in Afghanistan \nexcept his immediate family. He does not provide financial support to his children\u2019s \nfriends, who are citizens and residents in Afghanistan. In approximately 2016 or 2017, he \nloaned $500 to a distant relative. The relative repaid him.12  \n \nApplicant does not own a home in Afghanistan or the United States. When in the \nUnited States, he stays with his daughters in their rented apartment. He intends to retire \n                                                          \n \n8 Tr. 21-29, 51, 54, 68-74, 80-82, 129-154. \n \n9 Tr. 57-67, 83-86, 109-114, 124, 127. \n \n10 Tr. 60-67, 78-79, 125. \n \n11 Tr. 86-89, 119-123. \n \n12 Tr. 114-119, 127-128. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nin about five years and live in the United States. He provided an undated letter of \nappreciation from a military commander for his service as a cultural advisor.13 \n \nAfghanistan14 \n \n \nThe United States Department of State\u2019s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in \neffect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and \nthreats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel there is unsafe due to \nongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, suicide bombings, and insurgent \nattacks. These attacks may also target Afghan and U.S. Government convoys and \ncompounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.  \n \nAs recently as December 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned U.S. citizens \nin Afghanistan of reports that militants plan to conduct attacks against hotels, compounds, \ninternational organizations, universities, airports and other locations frequented by U.S. \ncitizens and other foreign nationals.  \n \nAfghanistan continues to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by \ndifferent terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number \nof high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government \ntargets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan \ninterests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists. \nThe Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.  \n \nAccording to a June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks \npresent and operating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, in what is the highest \nconcentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world. \n \n \nThe State Department\u2019s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was \nwidespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons \naffiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the \nrule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There \nwas also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n                                                          \n13 Tr. 90-92, 123-124; AE 10. \n \n14 HE I. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresulted in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts \nand interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or \ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as \nwhether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive \ninformation or is it associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under a \nforeign government or owning property in a foreign country. The totality of Applicant\u2019s \nfamily ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.15  \n \nThe United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to \nAfghanistan because of continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against \nU.S. citizens. It also has serious concerns about terrorist activities in Afghanistan. Recent \nthreats are directed toward U.S. citizens. Extremists groups are active throughout \nAfghanistan and terrorist threats are a serious concern.  \n \nApplicant, his wife, and four of his six children were born in Afghanistan. They \nsubsequently became U.S. citizens. In 2016 Applicant\u2019s wife, their eldest son, and two \nadult daughters moved back to Afghanistan. Their other son resides in Afghanistan with \nhis wife and child. Since she returned, Applicant\u2019s adult daughter married an Afghan \ncitizen and has a child. Applicant\u2019s two youngest children live in the United States. From \n2013 to 2016, Applicant and his family returned to Afghanistan each year to visit his father \nand other family members. He and his two youngest daughters returned in 2017 to visit \n                                                          \n15 The mere possession of a close personal relationship with a person who is a citizen or resident of a \nforeign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, depending on the facts \nand circumstances, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \ntheir immediate and extended family. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his spouse and children, \nwho are residents of Afghanistan, and his daughter-in-law, son-in-law, two grandchildren, \nand numerous siblings and their families, who are residents and citizens of Afghanistan, \ncreate a heightened risk. AG \u00b6 7(a) applies.16   \n \nI find Applicant does not have sufficient contact with his stepmother or stepsiblings \nto create a heightened risk. His father is deceased and no longer raises a concern. AG \u00b6 \n7(a) does not apply to these people.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant provided financial support \nto his children\u2019s friends. There is sufficient evidence that he provides substantial financial \nsupport to his wife and unmarried children living in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s family residing \nin Afghanistan, his familial obligations and financial support to them creates a potential \nconflict of interest and a foreign influence concern. AG \u00b6 7(b) applies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s contact with the Afghan ambassador to Uzbekistan was insubstantial \nand more of a courtesy than a friendship. His contact does not rise to the level of a \nheightened risk or create a conflict of interest. I find no disqualifying condition applies. I \nfind in Applicant\u2019s favor for SOR \u00b6 1.e. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on the facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife, two sons, two daughters, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, two \ngrandchildren, seven siblings and their spouses are all residents of Afghanistan. His wife \n                                                          \n16 Applicant\u2019s grandchildren are U.S. citizen because one of their parents is a citizen. It is unknown if they \nalso hold Afghan citizenship because they were born in Afghanistan and their other parent is an Afghan \ncitizen.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nand children living there are citizens of the United States. They moved back to \nAfghanistan in 2016. There is significant evidence that terrorist groups target U.S. citizens \nliving in Afghanistan. Some of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s neighbors are aware that she and her \nfamily are U.S. citizens. In order for her to retrieve money that has been wired to her, she \nmust show her U.S. passport. Based on Applicant\u2019s significant personal contacts in \nAfghanistan and the heightened security threats for U.S. citizens living there, I am unable \nto find that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and the interests of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) does \nnot apply.  \n \nApplicant worked as a cultural advisor for the U.S. Government from 2009 to 2014 \nwhen he was laid off. He was hired again in 2017 and deployed to Afghanistan in 2018. \nHis son works as a contractor in Afghanistan. His son-in-law also works for a U.S. \ncontractor. He provided a letter of appreciation from a military commander for his service \nas a cultural advisor. He has two daughters living in the United States. These are all facts \nthat must be weighed against all of the other facts. Applicant has a minimal financial \ninterest in the United States. His wife and three of his children moved back to Afghanistan \nin 2016. They have not returned to the United States. Applicant believes they will in the \nfuture, but when that may occur is unknown. He indicated his wife moved there to care \nfor his father, who is now deceased. She also moved there to be closer to her son who is \nmarried with a child. One daughter, who moved with her, is now married to an Afghan \nnational and has a child. Applicant testified that she has applied to have him move with \nher back to the United States. Applicant has numerous siblings with whom his wife \nmaintains some contact. Applicant visits some of them when he is in the country  \n \nApplicant is a dedicated family man. He is a dutiful father who provides for his \nfamily financially. I have considered Applicant\u2019s loyalty, devotion, and commitment when \nworking with federal contractors in the United States and his recent mission to \nAfghanistan. However, with Applicant\u2019s immediate family, including his wife, four children, \ntheir spouses, two grandchildren, and his multiple siblings all living in Afghanistan, his ties \nthere are too significant at this time. He does not have financial interests in the United \nStates and his only personal ties are his two youngest daughters. Afghanistan continues \nto have significant terrorist activity that specifically targets both Afghans and Americans. \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his family in Afghanistan, his visits to see his family, \nand his financial support for them is commendable. Given those connections, it is too \ngreat of a burden to expect him to be loyal to the interests of the United States and resolve \nany conflicts in favor of the United States over those of family. AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant and his family traveled yearly from 2013 to 2016 to visit their family in \nAfghanistan. Applicant and his youngest daughters visited his family in Afghanistan in \n2017. They visited for a month. While there, he had some contact with his siblings. \nApplicant provides financial support to his wife and unmarried children living in \nAfghanistan. His contact with his family members is not casual or infrequent. Insufficient \nevidence was produced to apply AG \u00b6 8(c). \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 2011. His \nimmediate family are naturalized citizens of the United States. All but his two youngest \ndaughters, live in Afghanistan. I have given considerable weight to Applicant\u2019s service \nand commitment to the United States, but it is not outweighed by his deep familial ties \nand loyalty to his closest family members. This situation may be minimized when his \nimmediate family returns to the United States. Until then, the heightened risks raised by \nthose familial ties in Afghanistan continue to raise significant security concerns under \nGuideline B and are unmitigated. At this time, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) implemented by \nthe DOD on September 1, 2006. \n \nOn December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence issued Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, revising the 2006 AGs. The revised AGs apply to \nall adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. I have based my decision on \nthe newly effective AG. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. I was assigned the \ncase on March 7, 2019. The hearing was scheduled on July 11, 2019, when Applicant \nwould be in the United States. Government Exhibits (GX) 1-4 were admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented one witness, and submitted \nApplicant Exhibits (AX) A-G. The transcript was received on July 19, 2019. Based on a \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n                                      Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Afghanistan. The request and the attached source documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) \nI. All of the documents referenced in the Request for Administrative Notice and the facts \nasserted therein, are from open sources and are dated. Afghanistan has been plagued \nby corruption and human rights abuses; it is often lawless; and it has been described as \na failed-nation-state. The United States has been at war there for over 15 years. \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe GX 5 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. Additional facts are \nsummarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old interpreter-translator sponsored for a security \nclearance by a defense contractor. He was born in Afghanistan. Applicant came from a \nfamily of ten children and fled Afghanistan as a refugee with his family to Pakistan in \n1988. (GX 4) He is single and has no children.

(GX 4) Applicant \nsubmitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SCA) on January 25, 2018. \n(GX 2) He has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, who is now deceased, worked in Afghanistan for a U.S. \ngovernment agency. Applicant\u2019s father sent one of his sons to the United States in the \n1960\u2019s. (Tr. 27)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s widowed mother and most of his ten siblings live in the United States \nas naturalized U.S. citizens or in Canada. (Tr. 30) Applicant has limited contact with his \nbrother S, who does not live in Afghanistan as alleged. He lives in the United States. \nApplicant saw him at a wedding in the United States in 2008. None of his family live in \nAfghanistan now and none are affiliated with the Afghanistan government, or any other \nforeign government.  They do not know anything about Applicant\u2019s application for a \n\n \n3 \n \nsecurity clearance. During his clearance interview, Applicant stated that he has never \nbeen confronted by anyone while in Afghanistan who seeks information about his \nemployment. Also, he has no sympathy, preference for, or alliance with foreign \nnationals. He works on the Army base, working with soldiers, and is not allowed to leave \nthe base. (Tr. 37) Applicant had never returned to Afghanistan, from 1988 until his \ncurrent work, in 2017. (Tr. 38) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA and his other security screening questionnaire \nthat when his father died in 1987, property was left to the family, to be divided among \nthe siblings and Applicant. One item is a home in Afghanistan with an approximate \nvalue of $200,000 U.S.D. (SOR 1.b) The second item is a factory operated in \nAfghanistan with an approximate value of $1,500,000. (SOR 1.c) \n \n \nApplicant explained that his one brother (S.) has taken charge of the properties \nand will not sell them as he was required to do after the death of his father. The brother \nS. refuses to sell the property and the rest of the family is in disagreement. \nRelationships have broken down due to the massive disagreement. Applicant also \ntestified that he has no desire to have a part of the inheritance. If the issue were to be \nresolved, Applicant would give his share to his mother. (GX 4) He has engaged in \ndiscussions with his brother S. as late as 2008, but his brother is managing the property \nand Applicant has no authority to change the situation. (Tr. 22) He also believes that his \nbrother S. has changed his name. (Tr. 23) Applicant expressly wrote in his Answer to \nthe SOR that he does not desire ownership of the properties, and he considers the \nUnited States his home. He also believes the U.S. dollar amounts are inflated after \nbeing in Afghanistan. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other brother (D.)  also works as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 23) He \nis a U.S. citizen and normally resides in the United States with his family. He spoke to \nthe other brother S, and confirms that he lives in the United States. (Tr. 36) \n \n \n \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations under Guideline B, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.c, in his Answer to the SOR. He explained and answered all questions at the hearing \nconcerning the SOR allegations. His testimony was confirmed by his witness. Applicant \nwas credible and assured that he knew what to do if approached by someone asking \nhim to compromise information. He was clear that such occurrence would be reported to \nsecurity. \n \n \nAt the hearing, the witness testified that he has known Applicant since 2013. He \nconsiders himself almost a brother. The witness stated that applicant has given him \ngood advice over the years and is always ready to help. The witness served in the U.S. \nmilitary and was honorably discharged in 2015. He noted that Applicant offered the \nwitness a place to live when he left the service. (Tr. 54) The witness emphasized that he \ntrusts Applicant fully. Applicant has taken care of the witnesses\u2019 special needs child at \ncertain times. (Tr. 56).  \n \n \nApplicant currently earns about $71,000 a year as a linguist. (Tr. 39) He is \nrenting a home. He has a car. He is saving money for retirement. He has taken many \n\n \n4 \n \npositions and worked hard to go to school and earn a living in the United States. In his \ncurrent position, he translates and advises the officers of the U.S. Government and the \nAfghan government. He travels on missions and is sometimes in dangerous situations. \n(Tr. 43)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted five statements from character references. Three U.S. \nmilitary officers who have worked with Applicant in Afghanistan in 2018 support him for \na security clearance. They each describe Applicant as among the best of 29 linguists \nworking with the battalion. He is dedicated, reliable, and works well with sensitive \nmissions. (AX A) Applicant is an extremely valuable member of the team and has \ncontributed significantly. He has a knowledge of both Dari and Pashtu. Under stressful \nsituations, he has remained composed, even under a high profile attack.  \n \n \nApplicant conducted 280 missions in the area of air assault assignments.  \nApplicant maintains an exceptional work ethic. He maintained a strong security posture. \nHe is adaptive and works with adjacent units. His knowledge of culture, history, and \ncurrent events in Afghanistan have shaped the operating environment. (AX B, C) \nApplicant\u2019s employer vouches for him and wrote that he has received nothing but praise \nfor Applicant. Applicant\u2019s employer worked for 34 years in the military and recommends \nApplicant for a security clearance. Applicant submitted three letters of appreciation for \nhis dedication and sacrifice in 2018 and 2019.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n6 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s widowed mother and siblings are citizens and residents of the United \nStates. One brother resides in Canada. Another brother, who is a U.S. citizen, works as \na linguist in Afghanistan. The brother (S) who allegedly lives in Afghanistan lives in the \nUnited States. Applicant has not seen him since 2008. Afghanistan is continuously at \nwar and continues to have human rights problems, rampant corruption, and terrorist \nattacks. It remains a safe haven for terrorism, and has been for at least 15 years. It is \noften lawless, and has been described as a failed-nation-state. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts may create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and \nthrough his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been partially raised by the \nevidence. AG \u00b6 7(f) is raised due to the inheritance issue. Applicant has no authority \nover his brother to sell the properties. He does not even want a part of it. Given the \ncircumstances in this case, Applicant was credible in that he can do no more to resolve \nthe issue. \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n \n\n7 \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the agency head or designee;\n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.1  \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \nApplicant came to the United States in 1988. He became a U.S. citizen in 1996. \nHis family resides in the United States or Canada and are naturalized citizens. He has \nno contact with his brother S. who lived in Afghanistan, but to Applicant\u2019s knowledge \nnow lives in the United States. He has spent half of his life in the United States. \nApplicant has gone in harm\u2019s way repeatedly over the last year, and supported the U.S. \nmilitary in a war zone. He has longstanding relationships and loyalties here. Although he \nhas the alleged issue of family business and property circumstances, the Government \ndid not dispute or refute what Applicant states. (Tr. 62) He is gainfully employed as a \nlinguist.  He has been described as a solid citizen. He has had no contact with the \nbrother S. There is no indication that his family is affiliated with the Afghanistan \ngovernment or intelligence services. His one brother also works as a linguist in \n1 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n8 \n \nAfghanistan. The other siblings are U.S. citizens living in the United States. Applicant is \ncommitted to his new life here. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (f) are applicable to this case. I find \nthat all foreign influence concerns have been mitigated.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B and in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case.  Applicant\u2019s clearance is granted.\n1\nOn 15 October 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) raising security concerns under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement and Substance Misuse.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a\n2\ndecision without hearing by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The\nrecord in this case closed 13 February 2019, when Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM\nwas due. Applicant provided no additional information. DOHA assigned the case to me\n8 March 2019.\nConsisting of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Items 1-3.\n1\nDoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20,\n2\n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) of Security Executive Agent\nDirective 4, implementing new AG, effective with any decision issued on or after 8 June 2017. \n1\n03/27/2019\n\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegation. He is a 24-year-old systems engineer \nemployed by a defense contractor since August 2016. This is his first real job after\ngraduating college in May 2016. He has not previously held a clearance.\nDuring a May 2018 interview with a Government investigator (Item 3), Applicant\ndisclosed that he had used marijuana in October 2016 (vaporizer), August 2017 (pipe),\nNovember 2017 (bong), and January 2018 (pipe) each time in social settings with\nfriends. He admitted to succumbing to peer pressure on each occasion, but stated that\nmarijuana use actually makes him sick. Moreover, He does not normally smoke\nbecause his grandparents died from lung cancer and he was training for a marathon. He\nwas aware that marijuana use is illegal, and is also inconsistent with holding a\nclearance. He stated that continuing to use marijuana was not worth risking his job, and\nhe had no intent to use marijuana in the future.\nApplicant disclosed his then-current marijuana use on his September 2017\nclearance application (Item 2). At the time, he was unwilling to commit to not using\nmarijuana in the future. He disclosed his additional marijuana uses during his May 2018\ninterview.\nIn his November 2018 Answer (Item 1), Applicant admitted his marijuana use,\nand stated that he no longer experiences any social pressure to use marijuana. He\nsigned a statement of intent as contemplated by the AG.\n \nApplicant submitted no work or character references, and provided no evidence\nof any community involvement.\nPolicies\nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must\nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG \u00b6\n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be\nmeasured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a\nclearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant\nadjudicative guideline is Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\n2\n\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by\ndemonstrating Applicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse four times between October 2016 and\nJanuary 2018. He also initially would not commit to abstaining from future marijuana\nuse.  However, Applicant mitigated the security concerns. After initially failing to commit\n4\nto drug abstinence, Applicant has twice stated his commitment to drug abstinence in the\nfuture. He has used no illegal drugs since January 2018.\nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give substantial support to Applicant. His\nillegal drug abuse was infrequent, although not distant. He credibly states that the use is\nunlikely to recur.  The issue is not so much the experimental drug use, but his\n5\nrecognition that drug use is inconsistent with holding a clearance. Moreover, he has\ncommitted to abstaining from future drug use, and provided a statement of intent within\nthe contemplation of the AG.  I consider that statement sufficient indication that\n6\nApplicant understands the potential consequences of any future drug use. I conclude\nApplicant is unlikely to abuse illegal drugs in the future. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline\nH for Applicant.\n \nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b625(a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . .; (g) . . . failure to clearly\n4\nand convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\n\u00b626(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\n5\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment [Emphasis supplied];\n\u00b626(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence\n6\nof actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: . . .

Nerney, Attorney At Law \n \n \nAugust 29, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn March 22, 2017, and September 18, 2006, Applicant submitted security \nclearance applications (e-QIPS). (Government Exhibits 1 and 2.)  On October 19, 2018, \nthe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline \nG, Alcohol Consumption; Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse; and \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 10, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019.  \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on March 19, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 8, 2019.  The Government \noffered four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Applicant offered seventeen exhibits, referred to as \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through Q, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \ncalled two witnesses and testified on her own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on May 28, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 46 years old, not married and has no children.  She has two Master\u2019s \ndegrees, one in business administration, and the other in project management.   \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and D.)  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Project \nManager.  She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption  \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in excessive alcohol \nconsumption that often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.   \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in conduct which shows a \nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that \nraise questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \nApplicant has worked for her current employer since June 2009, almost ten \nyears.  She was granted a security clearance in 2007.  In May 2010, Applicant was \narrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) with blood \nalcohol level of .08 or higher.  She explained that she and a work colleague were \ncelebrating a milestone and went out to a restaurant for dinner and then to a bar for \ndrinks.  Applicant consumed three glasses of wine with dinner and five vodka drinks \nwhile at the bar.  She admits that after consuming this amount of alcohol she was \nintoxicated.  Applicant was pulled over while driving her car and given a field sobriety \ntest, which she failed.  Her blood alcohol level was .19%.  In about July 2010, she pled \nguilty to misdemeanor DUI and was required to pay a fine, attend alcohol abuse training \nand serve three years of probation.  She completed these court conditions.  She states \nthat she also learned not to drink and drive in the future.  She no longer goes out to bars \njust to drink alcohol.  (Tr. pp. 49-51.)  Following this DUI, she abstained from drinking for \n\n \n3 \n \na while.  Applicant states that she now consumes alcohol about once or twice a month, \nand when she drinks she has about two drinks each time, usually beer.  (Tr. p. 73.) \n \n \nAlthough not alleged, when confronted by Department Counsel as to whether \nshe has a previous DUI in 1996, Applicant admitted that she had.  At that time, \nApplicant\u2019s blood alcohol level was a .13%.  As a result of that DUI, she was required to \nattend three months of MADD classes, AA meetings, pay a fine and placed on \nprobation.  Her driver\u2019s license was suspended and restricted to allow her to drive to \nwork only.  (Tr. p. 69.)  Applicant complied with all of these conditions.  Applicant states \nthat following this DUI, she did abstain from drinking for a while.     \n \n \nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use that includes her use of marijuana from \nabout January 1996 to about June 2004; cocaine use from about June 1995 to about \nDecember 2002, and in October 2015; and ecstasy in January 2016, while holding a \nsecurity clearance.    \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from January 1996 to about June 2004.  At the \nbeginning, she used it about once a day.  It tapered off as her group of friends changed.  \nShe stopped using it in 2004, because she was going to school to get her Master\u2019s \ndegree.  She last used marijuana in 2004 while she was in Amsterdam.  She did not \nhold a security clearance at the time.  She use it with a group of friends.  She no longer \nuses marijuana because it stopped being desirable to her.  (Tr. p. 63.) \n \n \nShe also used cocaine from June 1995 to about December 2002.  She states \nthat she used it during this period about five times.  From 2002 to 2015, Applicant states \nthat she did not use cocaine because she lost interest in it and no longer associated \nwith her friends that used it.  (Tr. p. 54.)  Applicant use cocaine again in October 2015.  \nShe explained that she was at a party at a friend\u2019s house.  Some people were going into \nthe garage randomly and she wandered in to see what was going on.  A friend of a \nfriend, who Applicant does not know, had some cocaine and Applicant used some.  \nApplicant states that it never occurred to her that she held a security clearance at the \ntime and should not be using illegal drugs.  She states that she has never worked in a \nclassified area and never used her clearance.  She did not enjoy the experience and \nregretted using it.  She no longer puts herself in those environments.   \n \n \nIn January 2016, while holding a security clearance, Applicant used ecstasy on \none occasion.  She was in Las Vegas with a friend of hers, and his group of friends \nwere all using ecstasy.  They were getting ready to go out for the evening to a concert \nand Applicant was offered some.  She did not feel pressured to use it, and again her \nsecurity clearance was not in the forefront of her mind at the time.  She states that she \nhas no intention of ever using ecstasy again.   \n \n \nApplicant executed two sworn statements of intent promising never to abuse \nalcohol or any illegal drugs in the future.  In the event that she does, her security \nclearance is subject to immediate revocation.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F.)   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant states that she now realizes the seriousness involved in holding a \nsecurity clearance.  Although she possessed a security clearance at the time she used \ncocaine and ecstasy in the past, she did not use her clearance to access classified \ninformation, and so she did not take the matter seriously.  Applicant states that she now \nunderstands the responsibilities and obligations that come with holding a security \nclearance.  This situation has been an eye-opener for her and she believes that she is \n\u201cscared straight.\u201d  (Tr. p. 68.)  Applicant does not believe that her employer has a \nseparate (company) drug policy that prevents the use of illegal drugs. \n \n \nTwo witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf.  A principal systems engineer who \nworks with the Navy met Applicant while taking a Master\u2019s course class before 2007.   \nHe interacts with her once a month and talks with her once every two weeks.  He states \nthat she is responsible and reliable and he has no reservations about her holding a \nsecurity clearance.  They started hanging out socially in 2007 when he moved back to \nthe city.  She educated him on \u201cgood beer\u201d in the city at the time.  (Tr.pp.  21 - 33.) \n \n \nThe other witness, a senior project engineer, stated that she has known the \nApplicant for several years, they interact daily, and they are friends.  She described the \nApplicant as a motivated employee who goes above and beyond her job to complete \nher responsibilities.  She is considered to be a caring, trustworthy, honest, and \ndedicated employee.  The writer does not believe the Applicant\u2019s past actions are a \nthreat to the national security of the United States, and she recommends Applicant\u2019s \nretention of her security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 45 - 68)      \n \n \nPerformance evaluations of the Applicant for the periods from 2013 through 2018 \nall are favorable and indicate that she either \u201cmeets\u201d her job requirements, or \u201chighly\u201d \nmeets her job requirements in every instance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.) \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from previous coworkers, friends, and professional \ncolleagues of the Applicant attest to her integrity, honesty and trustworthiness.  She is \ndescribed as intelligent, loyal and responsible.   One letter also indicates that Applicant, \nin execution of her duties, has been exposed to sensitive information.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits I and M.)   \n \n \nA Substance Abuse evaluation of the Applicant prepared by a certified alcohol \nand drug counselor dated November 28, 2018, indicates that Applicant does not meet \nthe criteria of substance abuse at that time, although her past consumption resulted in \nserious legal consequences.  Her current consumption of alcohol at that time was in \nnormal limits, however she is encouraged to self-monitor her consumption bi-annually.  \nThe report also indicates that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-abuse history involves being drunk to \nintoxication about 50 times in her lifetime.  She has blacked out from drinking at least \nfour times in her life.  She reported vomiting from drinking two times in her life and her \npattern of consumption was bi-weekly and she would consume four drinks.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit L.)     \n \n \nNegative Drug Tests of the Applicant were provided on November 14, 2018, and \nNovember 30, 2018.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Five conditions may apply: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in 2010 and prior to that in 1996.  Following both \nconvictions she completed two first offender DUI programs and abstained from drinking \nalcohol for a while.  Her history of two alcohol-related arrests and convictions shows \npoor judgment and unreliability.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n \n \nNine years has passed since the Applicant\u2019s most recent DUI.  She has not \nabused alcohol to that level since then and has no plans of engaging in conduct of this \nsort in the future.  Accordingly, this guideline is found for the Applicant. \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation.  Applicant is not a \nyoung and immature woman, with little experience in the defense industry.  In fact, she \nis 46 years old and has worked in the defense industry for his current employer for the \npast ten years.  After receiving a security clearance in 2007, she continued to use \ncocaine and ecstasy.  She last used cocaine in 2015, and ecstasy in 2016, while \nholding a security clearance.  Applicant claims that she is not aware that her employer \nhas any policy preventing the use of illegal drugs.  There is no excuse for this \nmisconduct, and her actions do no show the requisite good judgment, reliability and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information.        \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports \na \nwhile-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(1) \nUntrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release \nof sensitive corporate or government protected information; and \n \n(2) \na pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \n\n \n10 \n \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent illegal drug use while holding a security clearance \noccurred in 2016, just three years ago.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents coupled \nwith her illegal drug use calls into question her judgment.  Considered in totality, \nApplicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, reliability, and the ability to \nabide by rules and regulations.  To be entrusted with the privilege of holding a security \nclearance, one is expected to know and understand the rules and regulations that apply \nto them, and to always abide by those rules.  Under the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant has not demonstrated this awareness.  Her conduct does not show honesty, \nintegrity, good judgment or reliability.  At this time, Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for access to classified information.     \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G, Guideline H, and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  While holding \na security clearance one is expected to show responsibility and good judgment.  \nApplicant has not demonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified \ninformation.  This is not an individual with whom the Government can be confident to \nknow that she will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when \nno one is looking.  She is not qualified for access to classified information, nor is it clear \nthat the information will be properly protected.  Applicant does not meet the \nqualifications for a security clearance.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n\n \n11 \n \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns.    \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a, through 2.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant partially admitted and partially denied, or she fully admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) She also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) Her admissions 3 are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old, and she is seeking a security clearance to improve her employment opportunities as a translator.

Foreign influence security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 12, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On February 7, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence). \n \nOn March 11, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On March 22, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 2, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to me. On May 29, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 6, 2019. (HE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; there were no \nobjections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-16; \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 1-4). Applicant did not offer any exhibits. (Tr. 18) On June 17, \n2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.   \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Jordan and \nBahrain. (Tr. 15-16; HE 4-5) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of \nthose facts, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 17) Administrative or \nofficial notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See \nISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 \nn. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually \nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known \nor from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & \nCo. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Portions of the \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s requests are quoted without quotation marks and footnotes. \n \nThe first paragraph and the last paragraph of the Jordan section are taken from \nU.S. State Department Background Notes and fact sheets, https://2001-2009.state.gov/ \np/sca/ci/af/; https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/jordan/192420.htm. (Tr. 16; HE \n6) The other paragraphs regarding Jordan are from Department Counsel\u2019s \nadministrative notice requests (quotation marks, bullet symbols, and internal footnotes \nare omitted).  \n \nThe facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of \nwitnesses, names of other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and her \nfamily\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant partially admitted and partially denied, or she fully admitted all of the \nSOR allegations. (HE 3) She also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) Her admissions \n\n \n3                                                                                                                                             \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and she is seeking a security clearance to improve her \nemployment opportunities as a translator. (Tr. 5, 24; GE 1) For the last five years and \ncurrently, she has been a freelance translator. (Tr. 23) In 2004, she graduated from a \nhigh school in the United States. (Tr. 5) In 2013, she received an associate\u2019s degree in \nbusiness in the United States, and she is currently taking courses towards a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in accounting in the United States. (Tr. 6) In 2002, she married, and in 2005, she \ndivorced. (Tr. 6) In 2010 she married, and her three children are ages two, four, and six. \n(Tr. 6-7) She has not served in the military of any country. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and three children are U.S. citizens, and they reside in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 2000, Applicant immigrated to the United States when she \nwas 13 years old. (Tr. 20) Applicant obtained U.S. citizenship because of her father\u2019s \nstatus as a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 20) In 2006, her father passed away. (Tr. 20, 48) In 2011, \nher mother passed away. (Tr. 52) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, she said she was unwilling to \nrenounce her Jordanian citizenship; however, now she is willing to renounce her \nJordanian citizenship \u201c[i]f it is mandatory to grant [her a] security clearance.\u201d (Tr. 21) In \nresponse to the question whether she \u201cconsider[s] Jordan to be home,\u201d she said \u201c[t]hat\u2019s \nwhere I was born.\u201d (Tr. 21) In her counterintelligence interview, she said that she may \nretire in Jordan because her father retired there. (GE 3 at 4) She described Jordan as \n\u201cmy country.\u201d (GE 3 at 4) She retains a Jordanian passport, and she used it as recently \nas three months before her hearing. (Tr. 21-22)  \n \nApplicant lived in Jordan from April 2018 to March 2019 (11 months). (Tr. 22) \nApplicant and her spouse and children went to Jordan in April 2018 because her \nhusband was unemployed, and they believed they could stabilize their finances by living \nin Jordan. (Tr. 22) Her husband did not find employment in Jordan, and they were \nfinancially supported by her husband\u2019s brothers. (Tr. 54) Her husband has five brothers \nin Jordan, and none of them work for the Jordanian government or military. (Tr. 54-55) \nHer husband currently has employment in the United States in the private sector. (Tr. 22, \n53)           \n \nThe SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that three of Applicant\u2019s sisters are citizens of and residents in \nJordan. (Tr. 25, 37-38) One sister does not work outside of her home, another sister is a \ndentist, and the third sister is a part-time, semi-retired engineer. (Tr. 26, 29, 32) Their \nhusbands do not work for the Jordanian government or military. (Tr. 52) One sister \nresiding in Jordan is a dual citizen of the United States and Jordan. (Tr. 36-37) She \ncommunicates with her sisters by telephone on about a monthly basis. (Tr. 27, 33) One \nof her sisters is aware that Applicant is seeking a security clearance and that she is a \nlinguist. (Tr. 28, 39)  \n \n\n \n4                                                                                                                                             \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges one of Applicant\u2019s sisters is a dual citizen of Jordan and the \nUnited States and a resident in Jordan. This sister has a green card and now lives in the \nUnited States. (Tr. 34-35, 37) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens \nand residents of Jordan. (Tr. 39-40) Her father-in-law is retired, and her mother-in-law \ndoes not work outside her home. (Tr. 40, 42) When she visited Jordan from April 2018 to \nMarch 2019, Applicant and her family lived in an apartment above her parents-in-law\u2019s \nresidence. (Tr. 40, 52) Her father-in-law owns the whole building where they lived in \nJordan. (Tr. 53) She has about weekly contact with her parents-in-law. (Tr. 41, 43)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant\u2019s brother holds an important position as an employee \nof the Bahrain government, and he resides in that country. (Tr. 44) Applicant\u2019s brother is \na U.S. citizen. (Tr. 60-61) He received a Ph.D. from a U.S. university. (Tr. 60-61) He \nowns an apartment in Jordan. (GE 3 at 12) Applicant believed her brother applied for a \nposition in the government of Bahrain; however, Applicant was not aware of whether he \nactually received or currently occupies the position. (Tr. 44-45) She is not close to her \nbrother, and she had infrequent contact with him on holidays. (Tr. 45-46) She has not \nhad in-person contact with him for about three years. (Tr. 46) Applicant has refuted the \nallegation that she has a connection to Bahrain, and connections to Bahrain will not be \nfurther discussed in this decision. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant spent about 70 months in Jordan between \nFebruary 2005 and September 2016 after she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 47) After her \ndivorce in 2005, she went to Jordan to receive support from her family. (Tr. 48) After her \nfather died in 2006, she went to Jordan to support her mother. (Tr.  48) After she was \nmarried the second time in 2010, she went to Jordan and United Arab Emirates because \nof her husband\u2019s employment. (Tr. 48)  \n \nApplicant indicated her loyalty was split 50-50 between the United States and \nJordan. (Tr. 49; GE 4 at 1) She was never in a position where she needed to choose one \ncountry over the other. (Tr. 49-50) She uses her Jordanian passport to enter Jordan and \nher U.S. passport to enter the United States. (Tr. 57) It is more convenient and less \nexpensive to use her Jordanian passport to enter Jordan. (Tr. 57) If it was mandatory for \nher to surrender her Jordanian passport to obtain a security clearance, she is willing to \ndo so. (Tr. 59) \n   \nApplicant has contact with her family through WhatsApp, a computer application \nthat enables one to communicate with a group of people, including sending pictures and \nvideos at the same time. (Tr. 46-47) Someone in her family group, which includes her \nsisters, will normally send a message on WhatsApp about once a week. (Tr. 51)   \n \nApplicant has three sisters, two brothers, and eight nieces and nephews who live \nin the United States. (Tr. 55-56) She has a bank account in the United States and no \nbank account in Jordan. (Tr. 57)   \n \nApplicant emphasized that the status of her relatives was outside of her control. \n(Tr. 14-15, 19, 59) She should not have her security clearance denied because of \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \ndecisions her relatives made. (Tr. 14, 19) Applicant\u2019s husband prefers to live in Jordan \nbecause he misses his family in Jordan, and Applicant prefers to live in the United \nStates. (Tr. 48-50) She plans to return to Jordan for visits. (Tr. 50) \n \nJordan \n \nIn 2013 and 2014, the U.S. provided Jordan $2.25 billion in loan guarantees, \nallowing Jordan access to affordable financing from international capital markets. The \nU.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the U.S.\u2019s first FTA with an Arab country, has \nexpanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, providing cutting-edge \nprotection for intellectual property, ensuring regulatory transparency, and requiring \neffective labor and environmental enforcement. The United States and Jordan have an \n\u201copen skies\u201d civil aviation agreement; a bilateral investment treaty; a science and \ntechnology cooperation agreement; and a memorandum of understanding on nuclear \nenergy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help diversify Jordan\u2019s economy \nand promote growth. Jordan and the United States belong to a number of the same \ninternational organizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, \nWorld Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is a Partner for Cooperation \nwith the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \n \nThe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by \nKing Abdullah II bin Hussein.  \n \n  \nThe threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. The U.S. Department of State has \nassessed Amman, Jordan\u2019s capital, as being a high-threat location for terrorist activity \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Transnational and indigenous \nterrorist groups in Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement \nattacks. Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of lraq \nand ash-Sham (ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra, have conducted attacks in Jordan and \ncontinue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests, and soft \ntargets such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, \nschools, and malls. Jordan\u2019s prominent role in the effort to defeat ISIS, and its shared \nborders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. \n \nAlthough Jordan remained a committed partner on counterterrorism and \ncountering violent extremism, numerous terrorist incidents reflect the current security \nsituation in Jordan: throughout 2017, multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive \ndevices detonated in and around a refugee camp in Syria near the Jordanian border; \nand in October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee \ncamp in Jordan. Also in October 2017, the State Security Court prosecuted six people \nfor sympathizing with ISIS, after they created social media accounts to find Jordanian \nsupporters for ISIS and promote terrorist activity. In September 2017, the State Security \nCourt charged 16 people with a terrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to \ncarry out terrorist attacks against public security services; and the Jordanian General \nIntelligence Directorate arrested a 10-person ISIS cell that was planning to attack \nsecurity forces and tourist locations using explosive suicide belts. In 2017, the amount \nof terrorist activity in Jordan was less than in previous years.   \n \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nU.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. Government\u2019s policies on Israel, \nhave fueled anti-American feelings in Jordan. Recent surveys reflect that over 80% of \nthe Jordanian population have an unfavorable view of the U.S. Government. In \nDecember 2017, protests took place at the U.S. Embassy for 27 days after the \nannouncement that the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem. \n \nIn 2017, Jordan\u2019s most significant continuing human rights issues included \nallegations of torture by security and government officials; arbitrary arrest and detention, \nincluding of activists and journalists; infringements on privacy rights; restrictions on \nfreedom of expression; and restrictions on freedom of association and assembly. \nImpunity remained widespread, and the government did not take sufficiently strong \nsteps to investigate, prosecute, or punish officials who committed abuses.   \n \nThe Jordanian SSC took legal action against numerous individuals deemed to be \nterrorists under local law, including the arrest and prosecution of men accused of \nseeking to join Al-Nusra Front (ANF) and ISIS. Other arrests and prosecutions involved \nsupporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in  support of extremist \nactivities and also for \u201cpropagating ISIL ideology,\u201d a charge often used for online \nactivity. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant\u2019s sister now resides in the United States, and \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her no longer causes a security concern. As to SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nApplicant\u2019s brother may not live in Bahrain, and even if he does live in Bahrain, he may \nnot hold a position in the Bahrain government. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e are refuted. \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f in her SOR \nresponse and at her hearing. Her three sisters and parents-in-law are citizens of and \nresidents in Jordan. She resided in Jordan for about 70 months from February 2005 to \n2016 after becoming a citizen of the United States. She has frequent contacts with \nthese five relatives living in Jordan. Her frequent contacts are manifestations of her care \nand concern for relatives living in Jordan.  \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Jordan primarily \nbecause of terrorists and criminals. Numerous linguists have family living in countries \nthat have problems with terrorists and criminals.    \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Jordan is not, as \na matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Jordan with the United States, and the situation in Jordan places a \nburden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationships with any family \nmember living in or visiting Jordan does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not \nbe placed into a position where she might be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and a desire to assist a relative living in or visiting Jordan.  \n \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-\n*21 n. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power \nbased on their prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is \nwhether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members \nin a foreign country raise security concerns because those ties and \ncontacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Jordan seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or her family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Jordan has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in Jordan \u201ccould be a \nmeans through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Jordan or visiting those \ncountries create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure \non her family in Jordan in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified \ninformation. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced \nsubstantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in Jordan and has raised \nthe issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and \n7(e) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies. Applicant has frequent contact with or a close \nrelationship with her relatives, who are citizens and residents of Jordan. A key factor in \nthe AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties \nin the U.S.\u201d Applicant resided in the United States from 2000 to present, except for about \nseven years in Jordan. Applicant, her husband, and three children are U.S. citizens. She \nhas five siblings and eight nieces and nephews that live in the United States. She has a \nbank account in the United States. She prefers to reside in the United States over \nJordan. \n      \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by her relationships with relatives who are citizens \nand residents of Jordan. Applicant has close relationships with family in that country, \nand they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of Jordan\u2019s \ngovernment.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in the Middle East. Applicant\u2019s family members living in Jordan \nare potential targets of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified \ninformation could theoretically add risk to her relatives living in Jordan.    \n \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to her relatives living in Jordan are too significant \nto mitigate in the circumstances Applicant presented. Her connections to the United \nStates taken together are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns under Guideline B.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline B are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and she is seeking a security clearance to improve her \nemployment opportunities as a translator. In 2004, she graduated from a high school in \nthe United States. In 2013, she received an associate\u2019s degree in business in the United \nStates, and she is currently taking courses towards a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting in \nthe United States. In 2010, she married, and her three children are ages two, four, and \nsix.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse and three children are U.S. citizens, and they reside in the \nUnited States. In 2000, Applicant immigrated to the United States when she was 13 \nyears old. She has five siblings and eight nieces and nephews that reside in the United \nStates. \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with or cares for her family, who are citizens and \nresidents of Jordan. Her frequent contacts with her family in Jordan are a manifestation \nher care and concern for relatives living in Jordan. There is no evidence that her \nrelatives are current employees of foreign governments or foreign military personnel. \nHer and her spouse\u2019s relationships with residents of Jordan are positive character traits; \nhowever, they raise important foreign influence security concerns. Connections to \nforeign countries must be balanced against connections to the United States.      \n \n\n \n13                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant resided in the United States from 2000 to present, except for about \nseven years in Jordan. Applicant and her family spent 11 of the past 15 months in \nJordan. She has a bank account in the United States and no bank account in Jordan.   \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Jordan must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers there. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation \nand suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Jordan is a dangerous place \nbecause of violence from terrorists, and the Jordanian government does not respect the \nfull spectrum of human rights. Terrorists continue to threaten the Jordanian government, \nthe interests of the United States, the U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and \nassist the United States. Jordan and the United States are allies in the war on terrorism.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence security \nconcerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, and 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On October 22, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive \n5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline \nB.  The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \ngovernment, DoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 28, 2018.  He requested that his \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  On \nDecember 19, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing four Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on December 20, 2018, and received by him on January 11, 2019.  \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Items 1 \nthrough 4, and they are admitted into evidence, hereinafter referenced as Government \nExhibits 1 through 4.  Based upon a review of the pleadings, and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance is denied.    \n  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of Iraq.  Department Counsel provided a nine page summary of the facts, \nsupported by thirteen Government documents pertaining to Iraq, identified as HE 1.  \nThe documents provide elaboration and context for the summary.  Applicant had no \nobjection.  I took administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, and is not legally married, but has a cohabitant, and a \ndaughter.  He has also completed some college, and is currently applying for a positon \nas a linguist.  A security clearance is required in connection with his employment with a \ndefense contractor.    \n  \n \nApplicant was born in Bagdad, Iraq in July 1986.  He grew up in Iraq and left in \n2005 to go to Syria, because it was safer for him.  He also had a job opportunity in Syria \nworking for a construction company.  In November 2010, Applicant came to the United \nStates as a refugee through the International Organization for Migration.  He traveled \nfrom Iraq to Jordan, New York and Phoenix.  As an Iraqi national translator working with \nthe United States Army, his life was threatened, and he was given an opportunity to \ncome to the United States.  On August 18, 2016, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen.  (Government Exhibit 3.) \n \n    \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Iraq.  His father is \nretired from the Iraqi Ministry of Water Resources.  He was a well driller.  His is no \nlonger affiliated with the foreign government.  Applicant\u2019s mother has never worked \n\n \n3 \n \noutside of the home to his knowledge.  Applicant also has five brothers and one sister \nwho are citizens and residents of Iraq.  Two of his brothers are employed by the Iraqi \npolice.  One of his brothers is employed by the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service.  \nAnother brother is a self-employed electrician, and another brother is unemployed.  His \nsister is a school student.  From November 2010 to the present, Applicant maintains \ncontact with is family in Iraq and speaks with them about once a month.  In 2013, he \ntraveled to Iraq to visit them.  (Government Exhibit 3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse/cohabitant was also born in Bagdad, Iraq. She is a citizen of \nIraq and a permanent resident of the United States.  She and Applicant were married in \na Muslim ceremony in the United States.  Since their marriage is not legal in the United \nStates, Applicant did not believe he had to list her on his security clearance application.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father-in-law are citizens of Iraq and permanent residents \nof the United States.  Applicant maintains contact with his in-laws weekly by telephone \nor in person.  He also has other relatives in Iraq that he maintains weekly contact with \nincluding an aunt, a brother-in-law, and two sister-in-laws that were not listed on his \nsecurity clearance application but developed during the security clearance investigation.     \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the information provided concerning the \nFederal Republic of Iraq.  Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic.  The President of Iraq \nis indirectly elected by a Council of Representatives to serve a 4-year term (eligible for a \nsecond).  Although Iraq is an ally of the United States, the U.S. Government considers \nthe potential personal security threats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be \nserious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines.  The \nU.S. State Departments warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk of violence and \nkidnapping and advises U.S. citizens to not travel to Iraq.  The current travel advisory \nlevel is Level 4.  Do not travel.  Within areas under the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \n(ISIS) control, the Iraqi government has little or no ability to exercise control and ensure \npublic safety.  Arbitrary or unlawful killings are rampant.  People belonging to religious \nand ethnic minorities, and people who express support for the government of Iraq or \nWestern institutions, are at grave risk in these areas and may face kidnapping, \nimprisonment or execution.  Terrorist groups continue to mount a large number of \nattacks throughout the country.  Iraq is likely to face a lengthy period of political turmoil \nand conflict as it struggles to rebuild, reconstitute the Iraqi state, maintain pressure on \nISIS, and rein in the Iranian-backed Shia militias that pose an enduring threat to US \npersonnel.  ISIS will remain a terrorist and insurgent threat and the group will seek to \nexploit Sunni discontent to conduct attacks and try to regain Iraqi territory.  Violence \ncontinues largely fueled by the actions of ISIS.  (HE 1).       \n \n \nA number of foreign contacts have been omitted from Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance application because Applicant claims that he either overlooked the entry by \nmistake, he did not understand the question, or thought he did not have to list them.  \n(Government Exhibit 4.)      \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members include his mother and father, five brothers \nand a sister who are citizens and residents of Iraq.  Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nwhich is the only evidence he presented, failed to appropriately mitigate the SOR \nallegations.  Based upon the evidence presented, his foreign family connections clearly \nraise serious security concerns and pose a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulations, pressure, or coercion.  Given the violatile nature of Iraq, \nand the employment of his brothers in such high-risk government positions, place \nApplicant in a particularly precarious position.  There could easily be a conflict of \ninterest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information and \nhis desire to help his family by providing information.  Under the particular \ncircumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is applicable, and this contact as well as \nthe nature of the relationships pose a significant security risk to the U.S. government \nthat is not necessary.  Applicant has subjected himself to a heightened risk of foreign \n\n \n6 \n \ninfluence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest from his ongoing connection with \nhis family in Iraq.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members and the nature of his relationships with his \nfamily clearly pose a security risk.  There is a great potential for a conflict of interest.  \nAlthough Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, his relationship with his family in Iraq is \nclose and ongoing, and can possibly result in divided allegiance.  Insufficient mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has been established in regard to his family members.   \nThe relationship poses a heightened security risk particularly relevant to this \nproceeding.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  Applicant\u2019s \nfamilial Iraqi connections pose a significant security risk to the U.S. government that \nwas not mitigated under the particular facts presented in this case.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Corrales, Esq., Department Counsel \n                                       For Applicant: Leon J. Schachter, Esq. \n08/15/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMARSHALL, Jr., Arthur E., Administrative Judge: \n \n                                        Statement of the Case \n \nOn October 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on \nor after June 8, 2017. In a response dated October 27, 2018, Applicant admitted both \nallegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I was assigned this case on April 4, 2019. On \nMay 2, 2019, a notice was issued setting the hearing for June 26, 2019. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered two documents, which were accepted into the record \nwithout objection as Government exhibits (Exs.) 1-2, including a request for \nadministrative notice. Applicant gave testimony, introduced three witnesses, and offered \ntwo documents, which were accepted into the record without objection as Exs. A and G. \nEx. A is a motion for administrative notice, while Ex. B is an exhibit list incorporating the \ndocuments previously submitted with Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR. A transcript (Tr.) \nof the proceedings was received on July 11, 2019, and the record was closed. After my \nreview of the record as a whole, I find that Applicant mitigated Foreign Influence security \nconcerns. \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \nRequests for Administrative Notice  \n \nBoth Applicant and Department Counsel requested that I take administrative \nnotice of certain facts about the Federal Republic of Iraq (See Ex. A and Ex. 2, \nrespectively) Absent objection, I have taken such notice of the facts contained in the \nrequests. The facts are summarized in the written request and documents, and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note are various facts indicating Iraq \nis a country posing heightened risk in terms of assessment.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old linguist who has been serving in the same position for \nabout two years. He has received multiple commendations and positive certificates of \nperformance in that capacity, and recently was recommended for his most recent \nassignment. He earned an engineering degree before coming to the United States.  \n \n \nIn 2003, during the conflict between Iraq and the United States, Applicant saw a \ngroup of fedayeen soldiers preparing to ambush incoming U.S. forces. He stealthily \nmoved ahead about two miles to warn an incoming U.S. convoy of what was waiting for \nthem ahead. (Tr. 37-38) With Applicant\u2019s help, the U.S. forces were able to detain the \nguerrilla commandos. Of that event, Applicant noted: \u201cI was thinking if all the Army \ncame to change the life [in Iraq], so we can speak, we can vote, we can have \ndemocracy in Iraq. [Do I] just watch and wait on the line and just watch and wait for \nthings to happen or help these people to achieve the . . . noble thing they came for?\u201d \n(Tr. 38) Shortly thereafter, he was asked by the head of the convoy to help them with \ntheir immediate mission. He continued to aid and support U.S. forces for some time. \n \nIn 2009, when United States troops prepared to return home from the conflict in \nIraq, Applicant wanted to follow suit. He had become friends with many of the \nAmericans he had met and wanted to live in the United States. Also, Applicant was \nunsure whether he would be safe remaining behind in Iraq. That year, Applicant and his \nbrother moved to this country after his younger brother finished college. Applicant \nsecured a green card, then bought a house and found work, first in retail, then with an \nassociation helping mentor children.  \n \nIn about 2013, the brothers became United States citizens. In 2017, Applicant \nfound he was too old to enter the military, but was eligible for a linguist position \nsupporting the United States. To that end, he earned a competitive certificate for literary \nlanguage (linguist) from a leading international linguistics entity in this country. It is in \nthat capacity he has worked ever since.  \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents are deceased. Applicant has essentially raised his \nyounger brother since their mother died, when the sibling was 11 years old. Their \nemigration from Iraq took place soon after the younger sibling graduated from college. \nWhen they arrived in the United States in 2009, Applicant intentionally chose not to live \nin an enclave of Iraqi immigrants. He noted: \u201cif we are going to live [here], we are going \nto live in this country like any people born here. We don\u2019t have to create a population \n\n \n \n3 \n \nwho accommodate you. . . . I wanted to . . . blend in, to feel the normal life here that we \ndon\u2019t have . . . in Iraq.\u201d (Tr. 28) \n \nToday, Applicant\u2019s brother is a commissioned officer in the United States military. \nWhen he is in the United States, he lives with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s spouse was born \nand raised in the United States. They live in the same area as four of his wife\u2019s siblings, \nall of whom treat Applicant as part of their immediate family. None of them are aware of \nwhat he does for work. (Tr. 19) The couple has no children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncle in Iraq is or was an assistant to an intelligence official at the \nnational level. (Tr. 58-59) In that capacity, he has worked closely with U.S. forces. (Tr. \n59) He is the husband of one of Applicant\u2019s maternal aunts. At one point before \nApplicant moved to the United States, the uncle and Applicant worked in adjacent \nbuildings in Iraq, helping U.S. forces. (Tr. 61) Any personal interaction was incidental to \ntheir respective work duties. Applicant later met him in February 2017 in the United \nStates, at the home of a cousin who had come to the United States before Applicant \n(2007) seeking asylum. (Tr. 29)  \n \nWhile helping his cousin by running errands, Applicant returned to her residence \none day to find the uncle had come to visit. (Tr. 23) As he had been helping his cousin \nfor several hours and it was getting late, Applicant had to head home after 15-20 \nminutes. It was Applicant\u2019s first and only contact with this uncle since Applicant moved \nto the United States. (Tr. 23-24) The two did not discuss Applicant\u2019s work or aspirations. \nApplicant has no plan or intention to initiate contact with his uncle again. (Tr. 24) The \ntwo men are not close. Should, for whatever reason, the uncle initiate contact with \nApplicant, Applicant will report the contact appropriately. (Tr. 25) \n \nAlso in Iraq and both a citizen and resident is Applicant\u2019s aunt. She is in her mid-\n60s, retired from a private sector career, and is now something of a shut-in. Applicant \nknows very little about her. She is the mother of his American cousin, through whom he \nhad seen his uncle in the United States. Applicant and the aunt met at the cousin\u2019s \nhome in about 2016, a year before he met his uncle. Their meeting lasted less than 30 \nminutes. They also had limited social media contact in 2017. (Tr. 57) That was their last \ncontact. This aunt is not a spouse of the uncle at issue. She knows nothing of \nApplicant\u2019s work. He is not close to this aunt and he has no intention of communicating \nwith her in the future. (Tr. 57) \n \nApplicant is very happy living his present life, with his wife, brother, cousin, and \nsome dear neighbors nearby. He loves his home and neighborhood. His closest friend \nand next door neighbor is a native-born U.S. citizen, as is his wife. (Tr. 36) In rating his \nfamily on a 1-10 scale, with 10 being the most feelings of affection and connection \npossible, Applicant rates his brother and wife as \u201c10,\u201d his wife\u2019s local siblings as \u201c9,\u201d a \ncousin (described below) as a \u201c7 or 8,\u201d and the uncle and aunt at issue in this matter \nwho are remaining as citizens and residents of Iraq as \u201c0.\u201d (Tr. 21-22) Also in the mix \nare his other neighbors, children he mentors and peers, with whom he has developed \nan affinity.  \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \nApplicant is almost half way toward paying off a mortgage on a home valued at \nover $550,000. He has both a savings account and a 401(k) account here. He sends no \nmoney to family or interests in Iraq, nor does he maintain contact with any individuals in \nthat country. (Tr. 62) Except for a week-long visit to Iraq in 2018, which he quietly took \nwithout informing his family in order to visit his mother\u2019s grave, he has not been to Iraq \nsince 2009. He has no property, assets, or interests in Iraq, and his Iraqi passport \nexpired in 2009.  \n \nApplicant introduced three character witnesses. The first was a lieutenant colonel \nwith 26 years of U.S. military service who met Applicant on a deployment. The two hit it \noff, and the officer selected Applicant as his interpreter. (Tr. 73) Thus began a lifelong \nprofessional and personal relationship that has seen them collaborate on multiple \nassignments. (Tr. 74) He has been impressed by Applicant\u2019s professionalism, secrecy, \nand American values, and highly recommends that he be granted a security clearance.   \n \nA U.S. military sergeant with 35 years of experience also highly recommends that \nApplicant be granted a security clearance. The two have worked together off and on for \nmany years. Today, they communicate a couple of times a month socially. The witness \nwas most impressed by incidents in which Applicant helped thwart a kidnapping and a \nrobbery. (Tr. 89) In addition, this witness worked with Applicant\u2019s uncle in Iraq during the \n2003-4 and 2007-8 timeframes. He considers the uncle at issue trustworthy. (Tr. 91)  \n \nA third witness met and became friends with Applicant during the period after \nApplicant came to the United States, but before he became a linguist. At the association \nwhere Applicant mentored children, this witness found Applicant to be \u201cvery \ndependable, reliable, and trustworthy as an employee, so [they] got to know each other \nfairly well.\u201d (Tr. 95) As a former Federal Bureau of Investigation agent with 24 years \nexperience, and having held a Top Secret/SCI clearance, he recommends Applicant for \na security clearance. (Tr. 96) He finds Applicant to be reliable and very patriotic. (Tr. 97)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s adjudicative goal is \na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under the AG, the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration. Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.  \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \nwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. Anyone seeking access to classified information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence \nthat transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include \nconsideration of the possible risk the applicant may fail to safeguard such information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUnder the AG, foreign contact and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they create \ncircumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U. S. interests or \notherwise be made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAssessment of foreign contact and interests should consider the country (Iraq) in which \nthe foreign contact or interest is included.  \n \n \nThe AG lists nine available disqualifying conditions. Given that the uncle and \naunt residing in and citizens of Iraq at issue, I find the following apply:  \n \n\u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country, if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand  \n \n\u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nUnder \u00b6 8, three mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n  \n\u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n\u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n\n \n \n6 \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest, and \n \n\u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \n \nAs a threshold issue, I noted that the information regarding Iraq was incorporated \ninto this analysis above. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq, the nature of \nits government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record, all of \nwhich are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion or duress is markedly greater if \nthe foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent on the government, the country conducts intelligence operations \nagainst the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nHere, Iraq is a country of heightened risk, in part because of internal incidents of \nterrorism its government is grappling to contain. On the other hand, as the facts in this \ncase concerning both Applicant and his uncle demonstrate, the United States and Iraq \nare working together to contain threats by terrorists and malcontents while sustaining \nand maintaining the government of the Federal Republic of Iraq. The courage of both \nthese individuals in aiding this cohort cannot be readily dismissed. \n \n \nMoreover, it is clear Applicant\u2019s relationship with his aunt and uncle is both \ncasual and infrequent. Applicant does not have an established, close, familial \nrelationship with either. His contact with both has been minimal, with his last such \ncontact with both \u2013 whether in person or by Internet - occurring a number of years ago.  \n \n \nIn contrast, Applicant purposefully started his new life in the United States living \napart from fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s. He and his brother intentionally moved to a neighborhood full \nof the diversity of America and offering options not otherwise available in Iraq. \nApplicant\u2019s native-born wife is well-settled in their state, where they are surrounded by \nseveral of her siblings, who consider Applicant to be part of their family. Applicant\u2019s \nbrother lives with him when he is not stationed elsewhere in his capacity as a U.S. \nmilitary officer. Applicant has become a member of his community, becoming best \nfriends with his neighbors, working as a mentor to local children, and living his American \ndream. Such factors highlight what little nexus Applicant still has with Iraq, specifically, \nthe uncle and aunt at issue. Under these facts, it is highly unlikely Applicant will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of Iraq or his Iraqi kin and \nthe family, work, and life he has in the United States. I find AG \u00b6 8(a)-(c) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s highly credible \ntestimony, service to the U.S. military, familial support for the efforts of the United \nStates, and three impressive character witnesses.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s support for the United States predates his arrival to our country. He \nselflessly risked his life while abroad to aid the U.S. military. Since arriving on these \nshores, he has sought to both become a patriotic American citizen and to find work that \nwould help him spread its ideals. His brother joined him in coming to this country and in \nbecoming a United States citizen. He now serves in the U.S. military as an officer.  \n \n \nAlthough a resident and citizen of Iraq with whom Applicable has had negligible \ncontact, Applicant\u2019s uncle is serving or has served in a capacity within the Iraqi \ngovernment that has assisted the United States in its aims to provide support in that \nland. Ironically, one of Applicant\u2019s references speaks highly of Applicant\u2019s uncle, \napparently knowing him better than does Applicant, himself. Regardless, Applicant has \nhad no interaction with either his uncle or aunt since 2017, and he has no intention to \nreinitiate contact with either. They are far outside the sphere of his immediate family, \nwith whom he thrives in this country while living out his aspiration of becoming a \nproductive U.S. citizen. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nforeign influence security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

His request for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance is granted. \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 8, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On January 31, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline \n\n \n2 \n \nB (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR through counsel on March 26, 2019, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on June 10, 2019. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non June 21, 2019. The case was reassigned to me on July 3, 2019. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 3, 2019, scheduling \nthe hearing for July 30, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled, with Applicant \nrepresenting himself, vice his original counsel. The Government offered Government \nExhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. The Government also \nsubmitted Government Exhibit 4 for Administrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through I, which were also admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 7, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of Iraq (Iraq). Department Counsel provided a six-page \nsummary of the facts, supported by twelve Government documents pertaining to Iraq, \nidentified as Government Exhibit 4. The documents provide elaboration and context for \nthe summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government \nreports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. 22.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and single. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering. He is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in \nconnection with his prospective employment with a defense contractor as a linguist.  \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant was born in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq in 1982. Beginning in \n2007, after the invasion of Iraq, Applicant worked with the Multi-National Force in Iraq \nas a linguist. He worked with various American units in Iraq until 2012. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 13A; Tr. 34-42.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter immigrating to the United States in 2012, Applicant has worked primarily in \nprivate industry outside the defense field. He also attended college to advance his \nengineering education, with the hope of eventually earning a master\u2019s degree and \nworking in the engineering field in the United States. As of the date of the hearing \nApplicant was working as a systems engineer for a large American city. He hoped to \nreceive a security clearance and resume work as a linguist, which will put him in a better \nfinancial position to continue his education. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A, \nGovernment Exhibit 3 at internal Exhibit E; Applicant Exhibit D at 1, 3; Tr. 8-9, 44-47.) \n \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized American citizen on July 19, 2017. Applicant \nrenounced his Iraqi citizenship when he became an American citizen. He has no Iraqi \nidentification of any type. Applicant has no financial contacts with Iraq. His savings are \nin the United States. (Government Exhibit 3 at internal Exhibits F, J, K, L, and M; Tr. 44, \n75-79.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents live in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq. He also has four \nolder sisters and four younger brothers. Three of his sisters and three of his brothers \nare married. Applicant contacts his parents by telephone about once a week. He talks to \nhis brothers and sisters about once a year. Several of his relatives work for the Kurdish \nregional government as teachers or minor bureaucrats. He traveled to Iraq in early 2019 \nto visit his family, with the knowledge and approval of his prospective employer. During \nthat trip he used his American passport. That was his first visit since he left to come to \nthe United States. He provides no financial support to any of his family members in Iraq. \nNone of his relatives have knowledge of Applicant\u2019s job, or the fact that he is applying \nfor a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 18; Tr. 50-75.) \n \n \nApplicant \nfilled \nout \na \ncounterintelligence-focused \nsecurity \nscreening \nquestionnaire in 2017. (Government Exhibit 2.) He was also interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management in 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 \nat 7-11.) The information provided by Applicant during these occasions was consistent \nwith his testimony during the hearing. \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant is proud to be an American citizen, and to have assisted the U.S. \nmilitary in Iraq. He feels no sense of loyalty to Iraq, stating, \u201c[M]y only loyalty is going to \nbe to the United States of America.\u201d (Tr. 79.) \n \n \nApplicant was a highly respected and successful linguist while working in Iraq. \nThis is shown by letters of appreciation and certificates of achievement presented to \nhim with regard to his work during the period from 2007 through 2012. He was \ndescribed as a person of \u201cintegrity,\u201d with a sense of allegiance to the soldiers and \ncivilians he worked with. (Applicant Exhibits A and D at 2, 4-5.) \n \n \nFriends of Applicant who knew him both in Iraq, and since he moved to the \nUnited States, also supplied letters of recommendation. The writers describe him as a \ntruthful and humble person. (Government Exhibit 3 at internal Exhibit C at 3-8, 10.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant is very aware of his responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance, \nparticularly if advances are made toward him or his relatives. As stated, he informed his \nprospective employer of his travel to Iraq this year. (Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 54-55, 81-\n82.) \n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Government Exhibit 4: \nAttachments.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brothers, sisters, and in-laws live in the Kurdish area of \nnorthern Iraq. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nIraq has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate openly and \ncontrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country \nhave the potential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his family members who live in Iraq. He is a \nproud American citizen, and he feels he has succeeded in this country on his own, \nwithout help from anyone. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to rebuff any attempts by foreign actors to influence him. AG \u00b6 8(e) \napplies. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s family lives in the Kurdish \narea of northern Iraq. In this particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity significance arising from their presence for the following reasons. Applicant has \nbeen subject to considerable screening for his various jobs. He consistently has \nidentified his family members in Iraq. Applicant has completely mitigated the security \nsignificance of the presence of his relations in Iraq. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in the Kurdish area of northern Iraq. From 2007 \nthrough 2012 he worked successfully for coalition forces in Iraq. Since 2012 he has \nlived full time in the United States, working and attended school in order to advance \nhimself in his chosen field of electrical engineering. He has visited Iraq once. Applicant \nhas shown himself to be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the \ndefense industry. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States due to his sense of loyalty to the United States.  \n\n \n8 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/12/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 12, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 17, 2019. The Government offered \n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3. GE 1 and 3 were admitted without objection. Applicant objected \nto a sentence in GE 2. The objection was sustained, and the remainder of the document \nwas admitted without objection. Applicant and one witness testified on her behalf. \nApplicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G. There were no other objections to \nthe exhibits offered, and they were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on April 30, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted Hearing Exhibit I, a written request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts about specific controlled substances that are alleged \nin the SOR. Applicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request that are supported by source documents from official U.S. \nGovernment publications. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, except the allegation in \u00b6 1.a, \nwhich she partially denied due to the dates alleged. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. She graduated from college in 1998. She married in 2005 \nand divorced in 2007. She remarried in 2010. She has two children ages four and six \nyears old. She has worked for her present employer, a federal contractor, since October \n2016. Before then, from 2000 to 2016, she worked in different departments at a university. \n(Tr. 23-26; GE 1; AE B)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in December 2016. \nShe was interviewed by a government investigator in January 2018, and completed \ngovernment interrogatories in August 2018. She disclosed and admitted all of her past \nillegal drug use and activity as follows:  \n \nMarijuana use with varying frequency from January 1992 to September \n2013. \n \nNitrous Oxide use on various occasions from February 1992 to June 2016. \n \nSold Nitrous Oxide in 2007 on at least two occasions. \n \nMushrooms use with varying frequency from about August 2001 to May \n2013. \n \nEcstasy use approximately six times from August 2002 to May 2009. \n \nLSD use on various occasions from August 2003 to May 2011. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n2C-B, a hallucinogenic, used two times from 2003 to 2004. \n \n2C-I, a hallucinogenic used in July 2003. \n \nPeyote, used in 2004.  \n \nFoxy, a hallucinogenic, used in July 2007. \n \nDMT, a hallucinogenic, used in 2008. \n \nPoppers, an inhalant, used in 2009.  \n \n \n \nApplicant disputed the date alleged regarding her use of hallucinogenic \nmushrooms. She admitted she knowingly used mushrooms from 2001 to 2013. In June \n2017, she attended a memorial service for a friend. She had previously used mushrooms \nwith some of the people who were also in attendance, but she had not seen them for a \nwhile. There was a spiritual ceremony that included the leader dabbing oil on each \nattendee\u2019s forehead and saying a blessing. The oil had mushroom extract in it. Because \nof the nature of the ceremony, she did not decline the blessing. She disclosed this \ninformation in her background interview. She testified that at the time, she did not consider \nthe potential implications or effects the mushrooms might have on her. She stated after \nreceiving the oil dab she did not feel any dramatic effect from the oil, but became aware \nof a very slight altered feeling similar to consuming half of a can of beer. She testified that \nshe felt a duty to report this incident during her background interview even though it was \nnot an intentional choice at the time to abuse drugs. (Tr. 38-40, 44-50; GE 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant started using marijuana in high school. She estimated that from 1997 to \n2007, she used it about six times a year. She estimated she used marijuana with her \nfriends and her spouse from 2008 to 2013, about eight times a year. She used it socially \nand to relax. She estimated she used LSD about eight times from 2003 to 2011. She \nestimated she used Ecstasy about six times from 2002 to 2009. She used Poppers, DMT, \nFoxy, and 2C-B once. She used 2C-I twice. She said that except for her marijuana and \nLSD use, her use of other illegal drugs was before her second marriage. (Tr. 54, 61-75) \n \nApplicant testified that a defining time in her life was when she became a mother \nand it profoundly changed her lifestyle and social community. She does not want anything \nto prevent her from giving her children the best opportunities that she can. Because any \nillegal drug use would prevent her from doing so, she said she stopped using illegal drugs \nin 2013. Becoming a mother also led her to improve her professional life. Since she began \nworking for her current employer she has been promoted. (Tr. 27-29, 33, 77-79; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant admitted she used Nitrous Oxide until June 2016, a period of time after \nshe stopped using other drugs. Because it was legal to obtain, she was unaware it was \nillegal to inhale. It is commonly used in dental and medical procedures and its effect wear \noff safely and quickly. She purchased it twice in 2007 and sold some to friends at parties \nas a convenience. She admitted in her SCA that in hindsight she realized it was probably \n\n \n4 \n \n \nillegal to inhale it. She did not sell it to make a profit, but did make a small one. Her use \nof Nitrous Oxide after having children was to help her relax. She has not used it since \n2016. (Tr. 33-38, 50-54, 66-68, 77-79, 82-83; AE D) \n \nApplicant testified that she does not believe her husband still uses marijuana, but \nhas not asked him. He has not used it in their home and they have not used it together \nsince 2013. She credibly testified that since becoming a mother her priorities have \nchanged, and she is focused on raising her family. She admitted that before having \nchildren, she exhibited behavior where she sought to find different types of \u201chighs.\u201d (Tr. \n60-61, 66-67, 79-80) \n \nApplicant testified and provided a written statement that she does not intend to use \nillegal drugs in the future. Since becoming a mother she has taken management and \ntechnical courses to improve herself. She is focused on self-development through \nexercise and martial arts. She testified that she has disassociated herself from her friends \nwho use drugs. She avoids places where there may be illegal drugs. Her social activity is \nfocused on her two young children and husband. (Tr. 40-41, 71, 77-79; AE E) \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has never tested positive for illegal drug use and has \nnot been evaluated or diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder. She voluntarily \ndisclosed all of her drug use. (Tr. 74-75). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on her behalf. He has observed her daily for the \npast two and a half years. She is a valued employee and exhibits exceptional talent in her \nfield. She shared with him her past drug use. He has not witnessed any indication that \nshe continues to use drugs. He trusts her and believes she has exercised good judgment. \n(Tr. 86-91) \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters from her manager, a former supervisor for four \nyears, and a friend. She is described as honest, knowledgeable, trustworthy, dependable, \nthoughtful, deliberate, and stable. She exhibits a commitment to hard work; exercises \nsound judgment; and since becoming a parent is steadfast in ensuring she is a positive \nrole model for her children. (Tr. 31; AE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG & 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n\n \n6 \n \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \n \nFrom approximately 1992 to approximately 2016, with varying frequency \nApplicant used illegal drugs as noted above. She sold Nitrous Oxide on two occasions. \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed all of her past illegal drugs use in her SCA, \nbackground interview, and interrogatories. Her testimony was candid and forthcoming. \nShe disclosed that after completing her SCA, she attended a memorial service where an \noil with mushroom extract was dabbed on her forehead. She noticed it gave her a slightly \naltered feeling and in the interest of being totally honest, she disclosed this event to the \ngovernment investigator. Applicant\u2019s past drug use is extensive. I believe she made a \nlifestyle change. I found her testimony credible that she does not intend to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. She is aware of the impact future drug use will have on her ability to \nretain her job and its impact on her children. She has disassociated herself from friends \nwith whom she used drugs with in the past. She signed a statement of intent to not use \nillegal drugs in the future. She disclosed her past drug use to her supervisor who then \ntestified on her behalf. She has maintained an acceptable period of abstinence from illegal \ndrug use. Although she was past the age of youthful indiscretion when she continued to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nuse illegal drugs and was beyond the experimental stage of drug use, I believe that she \nrecognizes the impact that any future illegal drug use and subsequent ramifications could \nhave on both her career and her life. I find the above mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is an intelligent 43-year-old wife, mother, and exceptional employee. She \nhas an extensive history of illegal drug use. She credibly testified that the turning point in \nher life was when she became a mother. She has abstained from using illegal drugs for \nan acceptable period of time. Based on her honest disclosures in her SCA, background \ninterview, interrogatories, and testimony, I believe illegal drug use is in her past and she \nwill not use illegal drugs in the future. The record evidence does not leave me with \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 28, 2017. \nOn December 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 7, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 2, 2019, and \n\n \n2 \n \nthe case was assigned to me on June 21, 2019. On August 7, 2019, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for \nAugust 29, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept \nthe record open until September 13, 2019, to enable him to submit documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 9, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, \n1.e, and 1.l. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f-1.k, 1.m, and 2.a. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old senior software quality assurance engineer employed \nby a federal contractor since May 2019. He served in the U.S. Navy from March 2010 to \nMarch 2014 and received an honorable discharge. He testified that he was unemployed \nfor about two months after his discharge from the Navy. (Tr. 25.) He worked for a non-\nfederal employer until August 2015, was unemployed for about three months, and then \nworked for federal contractors until he was hired for his current position. (Tr. 29.) He \nreceived a security clearance in September 2009. \n \n \nApplicant married in October 2010 and divorced in July 2015. He has two children, \nages six and one. The older child lives with her mother, and Applicant pays child support \nof $598 per month for her. The younger child, whose mother is Applicant\u2019s current \ncohabitant, lives with Applicant. (Tr. 22.)  \n \nApplicant attended a university from February 2016 to April 2017, a community \ncollege from May to August 2017, and a university from April 2017 to the present. He has \nnot received a degree. \n \n \nWhile on active duty in the U.S. Navy, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment \nfor larceny in August 2013. He was restricted for 25 days, required to perform extra duties \nfor 45 days, forfeited $243 pay per month for two months, and was reduced from pay \ngrade E-4 to E-3. According to Applicant, he was with another sailor when the other sailor \nstole an item of clothing from the Navy Exchange. Applicant claimed that he was unaware \nof the theft by the other sailor. (GX 2 at 16.) He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question in his SCA \nasking if, during the last seven years, he had been subject to court-martial or other \ndisciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice such as Article 15 or \nCaptain\u2019s mast. He did not disclose his August 2013 nonjudicial punishment (GX 1 at 22.) \nThe documents reflecting the nonjudicial punishment were not introduced in evidence, \nbut Applicant admitted that he received the nonjudicial punishment in his answer to the \nSOR, during an interview by a security investigator, and at the hearing. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nIn January, March, and April 2018, Applicant was questioned by a security \ninvestigator about his SCA. In his sworn responses to DOHA interrogatories in November \n2018, he stated that the summary of his March 2018 interview with the investigator was \ninaccurate regarding his nonjudicial punishment. His comments included the following: \n \nWhen initially asked about any court martials (sic) or non-judicial \npunishments from the interview, I disclosed the information saying \u201cYes.\u201d \nOn 8-27-2013, I was involved in an incident in which I unknowingly aided \nan individual in stealing clothing from the Navy Exchange. I was found guilty \nof Article 121\u2013larceny, was reduced to the rank of E-3, and spent 45 days \nconfined to the ship\u2019s quarters.\u201d \n \n(GX 2 at 2.) \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, he stated that he mistakenly thought that the question \ndated back five years and not seven years. This explanation was unpersuasive, because \nhis punishment was imposed within five years of the date he submitted his SCA. He also \nstated in his SOR answer that he was not reduced in rank or pay, but he stated in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories that he was reduced in rank.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant was vague about his reason for not disclosing the \nnonjudicial punishment. He testified that he believed that he was being punished for not \nsupervising the sailor who stole the clothing and not being punishment for larceny. He \ntestified that he did not know how to justify his claim in his SOR answer that he thought \nthe question covered only five previous years. He testified that he did not believe that the \nnonjudicial punishment would be reflected in his military record. (Tr. 49-51.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 13 delinquent debts totaling about $56,573. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from January 2018 and August 2018 (GX-3; GX 4.) The \nevidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: automobile loan charged off in January 2016 for $34,072. In his \nSOR answer, Applicant stated that he was disputing this debt. He testified that this debt \nwas for an automobile purchased for his ex-wife before they divorced. When their divorce \nwas final, she stopped making the payments. The loan was in Applicant\u2019s name, and he \nacknowledged at the hearing that he was responsible for making the payments. He \ntestified that was attempting to negotiate a payment agreement but had not yet been \nsuccessful. (Tr. 14-15.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: automobile loan charged off in April 2018 for $13,043. Applicant \ntestified that this debt was for a voluntary repossession after a dealer refused to honor a \nrecall notice on a defective transmission because he had purchased it from a third party \nrather than a dealer. (tr. 45.) He testified that this debt is being handled by a debt- \nconsolidation company, and that the creditor had agreed to a 36-month repayment plan. \n(Tr. 15.) He did not submit any documentation of this payment plan. In his post-hearing \nsubmission, he presented a document reflecting an offer to pay $250 per month on this \n\n \n4 \n \ndebt. (AX C.) He did not submit any evidence that the offer was actually submitted and \naccepted by the creditor and no evidence of any payments. He also submitted a \ndocument, apparently from a law firm, listing this debt, but no evidence of payments or a \npayment agreement. (AX D.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: telecommunications account placed for collection of $1,718 in \nDecember 2015. Applicant testified that he disputed this debt because he was being \ncharged for two cellphones instead of one. (Tr. 44.) He testified that the debt is no longer \nreflected on his credit report. (Tr. 15.) However, it is reflected in the August 2018 credit \nreport. (GX 4 at 2.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: debt to electronics institute placed for collection of $1,672 in \nOctober 2015. Applicant incurred this debt for online computer classes, and it is included \nin his debt-consolidation plan. He testified that the creditor has agreed to a 36-month \nrepayment plan. (Tr. 15-16.) In his post-hearing submission, he submitted a document, \napparently from a law firm, listing this debt, but no evidence of payments or a payment \nagreement. (AX D.). The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: medical bill charged off for $1,585 in December 2012. Applicant \ntestified that this medical bill was for his oldest daughter, that it is included in his debt-\nconsolidation plan, and the creditor has agreed to a 36-month repayment plan. (Tr. 16.) \nIn his post-hearing submission, he a provided a copy of his credit report reflecting that the \ndebt was paid. (AX B.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: credit-card account charged off for $1,320 in January 2012. In his \nSOR answer, Applicant stated that this debt was disputed and is no longer reflected in \nhis credit reports. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a copy of his credit report \nreflecting that the debt was paid. (AX A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: utility bill placed for collection of $210 in November 2017. In his \nSOR answer, Applicant stated that he disputed this debt and all late fees were dropped, \nand that he had agreed to make two $73 payments in February 2019. Applicant testified \nthat this debt has been paid in full. (Tr. 16.) He submitted documentation of the payment \nin his answer to the SOR. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i: telecommunications accounts charged off in November \n2017 for $128 and $70. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he stated that both debts would be \npaid in March 2019. At the hearing, he testified that these two debts have been paid in \nfull. (Tr. 16.) He submitted no documentation to support his testimony.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: child-support arrearage of $1,505. Applicant testified that this \narrearage occurred while he was unemployed for three months. He testified that the \narrearage has been paid in full and his child-support payments are current. (Tr. 17.) The \ndebt is not reflected in the August 2018 credit report. It is resolved. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: charge account past due for $159. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he \nstated that the debt would be paid in March 2019. At the hearing, testified that this debt \nwas paid in full. (Tr. 17.) After the hearing, he submitted a copy of his credit report \nreflecting that the debt was paid. (AX A.) It is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: gym membership referred for collection of $932. Applicant testified \nthat he made a payment agreement in March 2019, but he has now disputed the account \nbecause the gym was notified to terminate the payments while he was being deployed \noverseas, but they continued to bill him. (Tr. 17.) The debt is not listed among the debt \nbeing handled by his debt-consolidation company. (AX C.) He provided no documentation \nof his dispute. The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: medical bill placed for collection of $159. Applicant testified that \nthis bill has been paid in full. (Tr. 17-18.) He did not submit any documentary evidence \nsupporting his testimony.  \n \n \nApplicant currently earns $92,000 per year. (Tr. 25.) After paying all living \nexpenses, he has a net monthly remainder of about $1,400. (Tr. 32.) He testified that \nreceiving the SOR in December 2018 prompted him to take action to resolve his debts. \n(Tr. 37.) When asked why he waited so long to take action after he was questioned by a \nsecurity investigator about his debts in January 2018, he said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a response.\u201d \n(Tr. 38.) In May 2019, he made a 36-month contract with a debt-consolidation company, \nand he pays it $380 per month to resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. 33.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n6 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s two short periods of unemployment \nand his marital breakup were conditions largely beyond his control. However, he has not \nacted responsibly. He admitted at the hearing that he did not begin to seriously address \nhis financial situation until he received the SOR. An applicant who waits until his clearance \nis in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those \nwith access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has engaged the services of a debt-\nresolution company to negotiate and resolve his delinquent debts, but there is no \nevidence that he has received the financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating \ncondition. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the child-support arrearage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \nApplicant was regularly paying child support until he fell behind during a period of \nunemployment, and his payments are now current. This mitigating condition is not \nestablished for the remaining debts alleged in the SOR. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, \n1.f, 1.g, and 1.k have been paid, but they were paid only after Applicant received the SOR \nand realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. Evidence of past irresponsibility \nis not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security \nclearance. Applicants who begin to address their security-significant conduct only when \ntheir personal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. In Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he asserted that he \ndisputed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g, but he submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate the basis for the disputes. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b616(a):  \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant has given multiple and conflicting answers for his failure to disclose his \nnonjudicial punishment for involvement in a larceny. None of his explanations are \nplausible or persuasive. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant submitted his falsified SCA in December \n2017. He did not correct his omission of the nonjudical punishment during a follow-up \ninterview with a security investigator in January 2018. He did not attempt to correct his \nomission until a second follow-up interview after he was confronted with the evidence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification was not minor, because \nfalsification of an SCA \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) Although Applicant submitted his SCA almost \nthree years ago, his falsification is not mitigated by the passage of time because it \ninvolved his current and most recent SCA. His falsification was arguably infrequent, but it \nwas followed by implausible and unpersuasive explanations for it. It did not occur under \nunusual circumstances. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his delinquent debts and lack of candor during the security-clearance \nprocess. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i and 1.k-1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n09/12/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 22, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign \ninfluence) and E (personal conduct). Applicant responded to the SOR on April 16, 2019, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me \non June 24, 2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non June 27, 2019, scheduling the hearing for August 8, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. Department Counsel withdrew the Guideline B allegations after \nthe evidence was presented. \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which was \nadmitted without objection. \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iraq. Without objection, I took administrative notice of the facts contained in the \nrequest. Since foreign influence is no longer a concern in this case, the administrative \nnotice and other facts about Applicant\u2019s foreign connections will not be addressed in this \ndecision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 63-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He will \nbe hired if he obtains a security clearance. He served on active duty in the U.S. military \nfrom 1981 until he was honorably discharged in 1985. He then served in the Reserve, \nwith periods of active duty, until he was honorably discharged in 1992. He worked under \nhazardous conditions for defense contractors in Iraq from 2006 to 2007 and from 2010 \nto 2011. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1988 and a master\u2019s degree in 2002. He has \nnever married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18-22, 62; GE 1-3; AE A) \n \nApplicant has a history of workplace problems related to when he was a college \ninstructor for a year and a substitute school teacher at four schools in two school \ndistricts. He worked on a one-year assignment as an instructor at a university from 2014 \nto 2015. In about November 2014, he received a written warning after complaints were \nmade against him by two female graduate students who were located close to \nApplicant\u2019s office. The complainants stated that female graduate students in that \nlocation felt uncomfortable by the attention paid to them by Applicant. They also stated \nthat they overheard inappropriate conversations Applicant had in his office with a male \nstudent about romantic relationships. The chair of the department reported that she \noutlined the concerns to Applicant, who did not deny the reports, but thought they were \nexaggerated. She reported that he was contrite and apologetic, and the matter was \nresolved satisfactorily. (Tr. at 23-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A) \nApplicant described the incident in his response to the SOR, as follows:  \n \nThe conversation for which I received counseling by the head of the \n[department] where I then taught was a private conversation in my office \nbetween me and one of my male students who was an Army ROTC \nstudent. He would often stop by my office to talk about my experience with \nthe Army in Iraq where I had been employed . . . for two periods totaling \nnearly two years. He enjoyed hearing stories from someone who had \nworked in a war zone since he himself would be commissioned an Army \nofficer upon graduation. The door to my office was open, unfortunately, \nand women graduate students in the area outside my office overheard our \nconversation. During our conversation we talked about pretty girls on \ncampus, not mentioning any by name nor using obscene language, but \n\n \n3 \n \nspeaking candidly about preferences, and specifically about how older \nmen are more \u201cattuned\u201d to beauty than younger men are. One or more \nwomen students who overheard our conversation took notes, and reported \nour conversation to the Department Head. . . . To the sensibilities of the \nwomen who overheard us, and to the Dept Head, our conversation was \ninappropriate. I was indeed embarrassed to have been overheard in \u201cguy \ntalk\u201d and to be counseled. There was no repeat of that incident. \n \nApplicant discussed the above incident during his background interview in \nSeptember 2017. A signed statement was not obtained, but the investigator \nsummarized the interview in a report of investigation (ROI). Applicant verified the \naccuracy of the ROI in an interrogatory provided to DOHA in October 2018. He stated \nthat he and the ROTC student discussed how an older man looks at beauty different \nthan a younger man. He admitted that they may have discussed one or more female \nstudents, and that the ROTC student \u201chad been with\u201d one of the students. Applicant told \nthe interviewer that the student the ROTC student had been with was pretty, and that \nApplicant had to try and not look at her in class because \u201cshe would wear yoga pants to \nclass.\u201d (GE 3) \n \nApplicant testified that there were a lot of pretty girls on campus, and an older \nman is more sensitive to their attractiveness than a younger man. He stated that he was \n\u201can old bachelor on campus full of pretty girls,\u201d and that he can always look, but he tried \nto be discrete. He stated that he would notice pretty girls of marriageable age: \u201cIf I\u2019m on \na campus with young women, I notice when I see a pretty young woman, whether she \nbe 16 or 17 or 20 or 30.\u201d (Tr. at 26-27) \n \nApplicant worked as a substitute teacher in a school district in State A in 2016. In \nApril 2016, the principal at a junior high school filed a substitute exclusion form with the \nschool district requesting that Applicant not be allowed to serve as a substitute teacher \nat the school. The reason cited was: \u201cInappropriate language when dealing with our \nstudents. Unprofessional.\u201d Applicant testified that a male student asked him if he liked \nrap music, to which he replied words to the effect, \u201chell no. I hate that s**t.\u201d (Tr. at 32-\n35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 5) Applicant described the incident in his \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories as follows: \n \nA boy asked if I liked rap music, and I replied \u201chell no!\u201d Later a girl asked \nme about the use of \u201cspat\u201d which she thought should be \u201cspitted.\u201d I replied \nthat it was like \u201csat to sit\u201d and like \u201cshat to you-know-what.\u201d I did not use \nthe common word. (GE 3) \n \nTowards the end of the 2016 school year, the principal at a high school in the \nsame school district informed Applicant that he would not be permitted to continue \nsubstitute teaching at the high school for the remainder of the semester, and that the \nprincipal would decide later whether he would be permitted to return in the fall. The \nprincipal later informed him that he was allowed to return and student teach at the high \nschool. (Tr. at 41-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3, 8; AE A) Applicant wrote in \nhis Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in September 2017: \n\n \n4 \n \n[The principal] said it involved an incident of \u201cborderline harassment\u201d \ninvolving a staff member. He did not say who the staff member was or \nwhat the offense involved. I believe it was a reference to my having \ncontacted a female teacher via text message about music on off-duty \nhours. I had given her a cd of music which she accepted, but perhaps only \nout of politeness. (GE 1) \n \nApplicant stated in his background interview in September 2017 that if the \n\u201cborderline harassment\u201d did not refer to the above incident, it could have been related to \nanother incident he had with a female teacher. Applicant asked a married teacher why \nshe was not wearing a wedding ring. He told the teacher that she should put a wedding \nring on, otherwise men like him would notice she was not wearing one. (GE 3) \n \nApplicant worked as a substitute teacher in a school district in another state \n(State B) in 2017. In February 2017, a parent complained to the high school where \nApplicant was teaching that he engaged in an inappropriate discussion with her son \nabout Palestine in which he made derogatory comments about Palestine. The son felt \nthat Applicant embarrassed him because he told Applicant that he was from Palestine. \nApplicant was blocked from teaching at that high school, but permitted to work at other \nhigh schools in the district. (Tr. at 50-55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 7) He \ndescribed the incident in his response to the SOR:  \n \n[The student] said his family are Palestinians, and they would like to visit \nrelatives in the Palestinian territories, but couldn\u2019t because of the war. I \nexplained that there was no war between Israel and the Palestinians, but \nthat there was a civil war in Syria, a bordering country. I explained that \nthere was a security wall between Israel \u201cproper\u201d and the \u201cPalestinian \nterritories\u201d to keep terrorists from infiltrating Israel and committing terrorist \nacts. I also explained that Palestine is not a \u201ccountry\u201d but a geographic \nterm, somewhat like \u201cAppalachia\u201d in America does not refer to any \nparticular state but to a region. I also compared the security wall to a \nhypothetical wall in [U.S. city] that could encircle an area known for crime \nto keep criminals from preying on other citizens. The student reported \nwhat I said to his parents who called the principal and complained about \nme. I was asked to come to the School District office where the same \nadministrator mentioned in [SOR \u00b6 1.c] above questioned me about what I \nhad said to the student, and told me that his parents were very upset. \nNothing I said to the student was unfactual. Palestine is not a country. The \nwall was erected to prevent terrorist attacks and has been very successful. \nBut the family were nonetheless upset by my seemingly negative attitude \ntoward Palestinians (although I did not express any negative opinions \nabout Palestinians in general). \n \nApplicant described the school\u2019s actions as \u201can example of political correctness driving \nschool policy.\u201d (AE A) \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant worked as a substitute teacher in another high school in the same \nschool district in March 2017 (incorrectly alleged as \u201capproximately April 2016\u201d in SOR \u00b6 \n1.c). In April 2017, a mother of a female student complained about inappropriate \nbehavior by Applicant towards her daughter. The school interviewed several students. \nThey stated that Applicant was talking to several students and classical music came up. \nThe daughter stated that she liked classical music. After a somewhat lengthy \nconversation, he asked her name and offered to burn a CD of classical music for her. \nTwo days later he gave her three CDs of classical music. He gave another female \nstudent a CD with a different style of music. The initial student\u2019s mother stated that her \ndaughter felt uncomfortable by Applicant singling her out. The mother felt that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was \u201cgrooming activity,\u201d defined by the Department of Education as \n\u201ca desensitization strategy common in adult educator sexual misconduct.\u201d The high \nschool blocked Applicant from working at that high school. (GE 3, 6) \n \nApplicant admitted to making a CD for the student. He stated that he is \n\u201cevangelistic about music.\u201d He stated that the student\u2019s mother was a regular \ncomplainer who filed numerous complaints over matters later determined not to be \nserious. He stated that he was told that he had broken no school district rules, and that \nhe was barred from future assignments at that high school to avoid any future problems \nwith the student's mother. (Tr. at 35-40, 55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE A) \n \nApplicant returned to State A. In January 2018, he worked as a substitute \nteacher at the school that did not permit him to continue substitute teaching through the \nend of the 2016 school year, but later permitted him to return. (GE 3, 8) Applicant was \nasked to resign after a female cosmetology student teacher complained, as follows: \n \nI [redacted] was helping [Applicant] (substitute) take over papers to the \ncosmetology classroom. As I was putting the papers on the desks, I tried \nto get pas[t] him and noticed he wouldn\u2019t move. As I was standing there \n[Applicant] looked me in the eyes and said \u201cI hope you have shorts on \nunderneath that.\u201d I had on a dress that day so it made me feel very \nuncomfortable after asking me that. Also with it just being me and him in \nthe classroom when he asked me that, I immediately walked out of the \nclass and told Mrs. [redacted] what he had said to me. (GE 8) \n \nApplicant provided his version in the response to the SOR.  \n \nThe incident mentioned in this section involved a young student teacher. I \nwas one of two teachers assigned to a large class, and the young woman \nwas doing her residential training. I admit I made an inappropriate \ncomment regarding her attire. The young woman was wearing a large \nbutton-down shirt like a dress with a belt around her waist, and it seemed \nto me to be rather short. It was not my place to comment in any way on \nher attire. I was not her superior. I commented, \u201cI hope you\u2019re wearing \nsomething under that,\u201d which anyone of my generation would recognize as \na \u201cprudish\u201d statement, not a \u201cperverted\u201d one. It meant, \u201cI think your dress \nis too short.\u201d It did not mean I wanted to see under her dress. I further \n\n \n6 \n \nasked if she had shorts (as in gym shorts) on. She apparently objected \nand reported me to the female teacher.  \n \nApplicant further stated that the school administrator \u201cexplained that he did not \nbelieve my comments were sexual in nature, but that schools are highly sensitive \nenvironments and one must be extremely careful about what one might say which could \nbring offense.\u201d Applicant wrote a letter of resignation at the school administrator\u2019s \nrequest. (Tr. at 55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \n \nApplicant described the above incidents as \u201ctrivial and unimportant.\u201d He stated \nthat they were \u201cdue to hypersensitivity on the part of a student or a teacher or an \nadministrator.\u201d (Tr. at 55-58, 63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A) He stated \nthat a security clearance will permit him to return to working under hazardous conditions \noverseas. He asserted the incidents have no bearing on his security worthiness:  \n \nEach of them has to do with some occurrence at a university, or at public \nschools which government representatives say reflect \u201cquestionable \njudgement\u201d on my part. The common denominator in all of these instances \nis not questionable judgement on my part, but hyper-sensitivity and \npolitical correctness endemic to contemporary educational institutions. No \nUS military officer on deployment in Iraq would find these incidents \nanything more than trivial and unimportant, and certainly having no \nbearing on the trustworthiness of another American who has already \nserved both in and with the military and has held security clearances.(AE \nA) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n\n \n7 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n\n \n8 \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant has a history of workplace problems related to inappropriate comments \nand conduct when he was a college instructor for a year and a substitute school teacher \nat four schools in two school districts. He received a written warning from the university. \nHe was barred from working at three schools and temporarily barred from a fourth. After \nhe was permitted to return to work at the fourth, he was forced to resign from the school \ndistrict for inappropriate comments to a student teacher. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges conduct at a specific high school in \u201capproximately April \n2016.\u201d The conduct in that school occurred in about March 2017. I do not find that \nApplicant was misled by the incorrect date in the allegation.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n\n \n9 \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant accepts little responsibility for his conduct. He described the incidents \nas \u201ctrivial and unimportant,\u201d and due to \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d and \u201chypersensitivity on \nthe part of a student or a teacher or an administrator.\u201d Any one or more of the incidents, \nif considered in isolation or in a piecemeal manner, might not be enough to affect \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. However, the number of incidents and the \nrecidivistic nature of the conduct, despite the adverse consequences to Applicant, \nsuggest he would not or could not conform his conduct to societal norms. I also note \nthat the last incident occurred at a school he was permitted to return to; and it occurred \nafter he submitted an SF 86 and was interviewed for his background investigation in \nwhich he discussed other incidents. He claims that the comment to the student teacher \nwas a \u201cprudish\u201d statement, not a \u201cperverted\u201d one. That is difficult to accept in light of his \nprevious comments and actions. However, even if true, it reveals a significant flaw in \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. Applicant\u2019s actions caused him to be disciplined at a university, \nprevented from working at three schools, and forced to resign from a fourth. Perhaps it \nis time for him to look at himself and stop blaming everyone else for being \nhypersensitive. \n \n \nI am unable to determine that additional inappropriate conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. The above mitigating factors, individually or collectively, are insufficient \nto dispel the personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and his work under dangerous conditions in support of the \n\n \n10 \n \nU.S. mission in Iraq. However, that is insufficient to overcome the concerns raised by \nhis repeated inappropriate conduct. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n3 \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n\n \n4 \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of material facts during her interview \nwith the DoD investigator, the following disqualifying condition applies: \n \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply. \nApplicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct her falsifications, but \ncontinued them in her answer to the SOR. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n5 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised \nby her falsifications. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1 Guideline E (Personal Conduct): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nRichard A.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 6, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 17, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 24, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 12, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 and 2, which were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left open \nuntil March 12, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant presented three \n\n \n2 \n \ndocuments, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (TR) on February 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the two allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 1.b. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 17 line \n3 to page 18 line 4, and GX 1 at page 5.) He has been employed with the defense \ncontractor since \u201cFebruary of 2016.\u201d (TR at page 17 lines 10~17.) Applicant is well \nrespected in the workplace. (AppX A.) \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \n1.a. Applicant admits that he falsified his April 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) in his response to \u201cSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of \nDrugs.\u201d (TR at page 18 line 5 to page 21 at line 25, and GX 1 at pages 32~33.) He \nthought his one-time usage in 2011 was \u201cirrelevant.\u201d (TR at page 18 lines 17~25.) I find \nthis to be a willful falsification. \n \n \n1.b. In June of 2018, Applicant admits that he was less than candid with a DoD \ninvestigator when he failed to disclose his more recent one-time use of marijuana in \nSeptember of 2017. (TR at page 22 line 1 to page 24 line 17, and GX 2.) I find this to be \nanother willful falsification. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n3 \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \n \n  \nApplicant falsified his April 2017 e-QIP, and was less than candid with the \nGovernment investigator during his June 2018 follow up interview. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n5 \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nNone of these are applicable in this case. \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the work place. (AppX A.) However, overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nPersonal Conduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn October 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DoD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n04/08/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 30, 2018, and elected to have his\ncase decided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on January 31, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in\nthe FORM. He did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March\n22, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) accumulated five delinquent consumer\ndebts exceeding $26,000 and (b) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in September\n2007 and received his discharged in January 2008. (Items 3 and 6) Allegedly, his\naccumulated delinquent debts remain  unresolved and outstanding.\n                \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered by\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f. with explanations. He claimed he returned the vehicle covered by\nSOR \u00b6 1.a and offered no explanations or plans related to the debts covered by SOR  \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b-1.d, or his bankruptcy petition and discharge in 2008. Applicant denied the allegations\ncovered by SOR \u00b6 1.e without any explanations or claims.\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old service technical services representative for a defense\ncontractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted by Applicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married in 1992, divorced in 1993, and remarried in 1995. (Items 4-5) \nHe has ten children from this marriage. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in April 2008.\n(Items 4-5) Applicant enlisted in the Army in October 1984 and served two years of active\nduty and two years of inactive Reserve duty.

(Items 4-5) While employed full time by his current employer,\nApplicant worked contemporaneously as a part-time nutrition aide for a local nursing\ncenter. (Items 4-5) \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nIn September 2007, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief. (Items 1\nand 6) Prior to filing his petition, he certified to completing required financial counseling\nwithout providing a debt repayment plan. (Item 6) Applicant scheduled assets totaling\n$277,371 and liabilities totaling $369,111. (Item 6) He scheduled secured claims totaling\n$266,000 and unsecured non-priority claims totaling $102,866. (Item 6)   Records confirm\n2\n\nthat he received his bankruptcy discharge in January 2008 with no discernible assets to\ndistribute to creditors. \nBetween 2012 and 2018 Applicant accumulated additional delinquent debts (five in\nall) exceeding $26,000. Since returning to full-time employment in 2010, following a brief\nperiod of unemployment, he has not provided any documented proof of his addressing\nany of these debts. (Items 1-9) While he claimed an intent to work out payment\narrangements with his creditors, he has provided no documented proof of undertaking\nany repayment arrangements with his creditors to date. (Items 1-9)\nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n3\n\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n4\n\nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts\nafter receiving a Chapter 7 discharge in 2008, in what can be characterized as a no-\nasset case. Since his emergence from bankruptcy in 2008, he has accumulated over\n$26,000 in delinquent debts without any probative explanation aside from a brief period\nof unemployment in 2010. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the\napplication of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to\ndo so\u201d;  and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts negate the need for any independent\nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006).\nEach of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are fully documented and create some judgment\nissues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses\nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical\nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in\nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified\ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App.\nBd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s\ncited circumstances (brief unemployment in 2010) provide little extenuating benefit.  MC\n\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d has minimal application to Applicant\u2019s situation. His failure to\naddress his debt delinquencies after he returned to full-time employment status in June\n2010  precludes him from taking advantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6\n20(b).\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of\ndelinquent debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)  In\nApplicant\u2019s case, his failures or inability to establish documented payment initiatives \nwith his listed SOR creditors, both before and after the initiation of the security\nclearance process, prelude favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised\nsecurity concerns over the state of his finances. \n5\n\nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his delinquent debts to merit enough positive credit to\nmitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in addressing his\nfinances reflect too little evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to\novercome reasonable doubts about his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect\nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that his finances are not\nsufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and\ncircumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.f:\n               Against Applicant\n                                                                       Conclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

He failed to provide sufficient \nevidence to explain why he was unable to pay or otherwise resolve the debts in the \nStatement of Reasons (SOR). Financial considerations security concerns are not \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.  \n \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn December 5, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). (SOR Response) On March 21, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on April 9, 2019.  \n \nFour Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 4) were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant submitted no documents at the hearing. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on April 18, 2019. The record was held open \nfollowing the hearing to allow Applicant to submit documents. No additional submissions \nwere received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted his home went to foreclosure, but \ndenied the five additional delinquent obligations listed in the SOR. After a thorough review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old program manager who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 2007 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. He is married, \nand has a daughter age 22 and a son age 18. His annual salary is approximately \n$125,000 and his wife, a special education school teacher, has an annual salary of \n$50,000. (Tr. 23) She has been employed as a teacher for 22 years. (Tr. 27)  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his March 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP), he indicated he had two delinquent obligations of $428 \nand $103 He also listed a delinquent $1,800 student loan and stated he was currently in \nthe process of establishing a monthly $250 automatic draft to pay the student loan \nobligation. (Ex. 1)  \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts, and the record establishes the status of \nApplicant\u2019s past-due accounts as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges $27,084 was past due on his mortgage that went to foreclosure. \n(Ex. 3) Applicant stated he purchased the home in 1997. He paid $72,000 for the home \nand obtained a mortgage requiring monthly mortgage payments of $1,200. (Tr. 18) His \nJuly 2017 credit report indicating that in July 2006, the current lender obtained the 30-\nyear mortgage with a balance of $76,000. The mortgage required monthly payments of \n$993. (Ex. 3, 4) As of July 2017, the balance owed was $78,516.  \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant had an enhanced subject interview during which his \nfinances were discussed. His wife failed to pay the mortgage for four or five months \nresulting in $27,084 becoming past due. (Ex. 2) He was unaware his wife was not making \nthe mortgage payments as required. He indicated that his wife was handling the \n\n \n3 \nhousehold\u2019s finances. (Tr. 17, 28, 31) That has since changed, Applicant has taken a \nmore active role in the household\u2019s finances. \n \nApplicant went to court and was given the option to bring the mortgage current or \nvacate the property. (Tr. 17) He chose to leave. The bank gave him three months to leave. \n(Ex. 2) In August 2016, the bank forced him to leave the residence. (Ex. 2) He asserts he \nhas not received any correspondence from the lender following the foreclosure nor has \nhe contacted the lender since leaving the home. (Tr. 25) He does not know the home\u2019s \nsale price at foreclosure nor the amount of equity he accumulated during the 19 years he \nowned the home. (Tr. 26) He says failing to list the foreclosure on his March 2017 was \nnot an intentional omission or misrepresentation. (Ex. 2) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges an $834 charged-off credit card account. (Ex. 4) The account \nwas opened in July 2017. (Ex. 2) In his December 2018 SOR Response and at the \nhearing, Applicant stated he did not know the nature of the debt. (Tr. 19) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $1,356 charged-off account. (Ex. 4) The account was opened \nin January 2017. (Ex. 2) In his December 2018 SOR Response and at the hearing, \nApplicant did not recognize this debt. (Tr. 20) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $428 collection account. (Ex. 3) During his June 2018 \ninterview, Applicant indicated the debt was a credit card account. He had no knowledge \nabout why it was not paid or when it went to collection. He asserts he paid the debt, but \nprovided no documentation supporting such payment. (Ex. 2) In his December 2018 SOR \nResponse and at the hearing, Applicant indicated he did not recognize this debt. (Tr. 20) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $415 charged-off account. (Ex. 3, 4) During his June 2018 \ninterview, Applicant indicated he still has a credit card with this company, and would follow \nup on the debt and satisfy it. (Ex. 2)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $103 telephone service collection account. (Ex. 3) During his \nJune 2018 interview, Applicant indicated he was unaware of this debt. He contacted the \ncreditor and was told this was an old land-line account. He stated he believed this debt \nwas paid when the land line was disconnected. He provided no documentation showing \npayment of the debt. He indicated he would follow up on the debt and satisfy it. (Ex. 2)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 2018 SOR Response, for the delinquent obligations listed \nin SOR 1.b through 1.f., he stated. \u201cI will work with this company to pay what is owed to \nthem. I am not aware of this company.\u201d (SOR Response) At the hearing, he recognized \nthe debts in SOR 1.a and 1.f. He said he would contact the companies and take care of \nthe debts. (Tr. 21) He provided no documentation that he made any payments on the \nSOR delinquent obligations during the four months between his receipt of the SOR and \nthe hearing. There is no showing he has contacted any of the holders of the delinquent \nobligations. (Tr. 35) At his hearing, he stated he would contact the companies and pay \nthe debts within two months of the hearing. (Tr. 36) \n \n\n \n4 \nApplicant has been renting a home for three years and has always been timely on \nhis $1,100 monthly rent payments. (Tr. 17, 37) He has $30,000 in his 401(k) retirement \nplan. (Tr. 46) He is current on his wife\u2019s, his daughter\u2019s, and son\u2019s vehicle payments that \ntotal $1,300 per month. (Tr. 37) Applicant has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. \n41, 46) He is very involved in the community. (Tr. 43) He volunteers for the Special \nOlympics and has helped to raise $300,000 for the organization over the years. (Tr. 43) \nHe is also involved in a drug-free city organization, the county Relay for Life, and is very \ninvolved in civic organizations, being the past president of one. (Tr. 42) \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit any documentation showing \npayment of the delinquent obligations or any other material he believed was relevant. (Tr. \n9) No documents were received. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n \n5 \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \n\n \n6 \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant had five additional delinquent obligations that totaled $3,136 in addition \nto the foreclosure. He knew of the Government\u2019s concern about his finances when he \ncompleted his March 2017 e-QIP. During his June 2018 interview, he was questioned \nabout his delinquent obligations and said he would contact the companies and pay the \ndebts. In his December 2018 SOR Response, he again said he would work with the \ncompanies to pay what was owed. At the hearing, he again said he would contacted the \ncompanies and pay the debts. However, there is no documentation showing any \npayments.  \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each debt in the SOR, \nor even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to \nshow that he has a plan to resolve his debts and that he has taken significant steps to \nimplement his plan. Applicant expressed a willingness to pay his delinquent debts \nnumerous times. With a household income of $175,000, he had the ability to pay his past-\ndue debts. He has yet to show documentation that he has resolved even the smallest of \n\n \n7 \nthe SOR debts, which was $103. He has stated numerous time he intends to contact the \ncompanies and pay the debts. A promise to pay debts at some future date is not a \nsubstitute for a track record of timely payments. See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. \nBd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). Without \ndocumented progress toward resolving the debts in the SOR, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \n\u00b6 20(d) apply. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. In 1997, Applicant purchased a home for \n$72,000. In July 2017, twenty years later, the balance owed was $78,516. He made \nmonthly payments of approximately $1,000 for most of that period. His wife stopped \nmaking mortgage payments resulting in a past-due amount of $27,084. He asserts he \nwas four or five months behind on his mortgage, however the amount past due indicates \nhe was closer to two years behind on his mortgage. Following the foreclosure, he never \nchecked to see what the house sold for or how much equity he had in the house. He \nsimply moved out when asked to do so by the lender and never inquired as to any debt \nremaining on the home. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the debts remain unpaid, and as such, are \nconsidered recent. Applicant has been questioned about his delinquent obligations \nnumerous times. His failure to take reasonable steps to address his delinquent accounts \nafter he had been questioned about them casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. For the mitigating factors in AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, the \nindividual must establish that the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control and the individual must have acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant and his wife were employed full-time and had the income to \nmake payments toward the past-due obligations. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there has been no financial counseling and \nthe debts remain unpaid. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because there is no good-faith effort \nto pay the debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because Applicant has failed to provide any \ndocumented proof showing that the debts are not his debts.  \n \nApplicant has sufficient funds to satisfy all of his outstanding accounts, but has not \nshown any responsible action to resolve his debts. There is no indication that payments \nwere made on any of the delinquent SOR obligations. There is no evidence that he \nreceived financial counseling, or that he initiated a good-faith effort to repay his financial \nobligations. Applicant failed to provide documentation that he has a legitimate basis to \ndispute any of his outstanding accounts, and he failed to provide a copy of a cancelled \ncheck or other documentation showing he has paid or resolved a debt alleged in the SOR. \nUnder all of these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n8 \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other actions to resolve the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s actions show a lack of financial \nresponsibility and raise unmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. He is very active in the community, however, his \ncivic involvement is not sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by his failure \nto pay his delinquent obligations. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision.  \n \nThe decision to deny Applicant a clearance at this time should not be construed as \na determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true reform and \nrehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance in the future. The \nawarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on \napplying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under \nApplicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should Applicant \nbe afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. Favorable consideration \nwould be given to payment of his delinquent obligations. However, a clearance at this \ntime is not warranted.  \n\n \n9 \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s fitness to hold a \nsecurity clearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 19, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 20, 2019.  \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through N, which \nwere admitted without objection. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iraq. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in \nthe request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated \nverbatim in this decision. Of particular note is the significant threat of terrorism and \nongoing human rights problems in Iraq. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer for about two years. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has never \nmarried, and he has no children. \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. When he was young, he and his \nfather would listen to Voice of America on the radio, and he would imagine what it would \nbe like to live in the United States. While in college in 2004 to 2005, he volunteered to \nwork for the U.S. military. He worked under dangerous conditions in Iraq as a linguist for \nthe U.S. military during summers while he was in college and full time after he \ngraduated from college. Like the U.S. military forces he was supporting, he came under \nfire. Because of his work, he was eligible for a special immigrant visa. He immigrated to \nthe United States in 2010. He became a U.S. citizen in 2017. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother and six siblings are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. None of his family have visited him in the United States. Applicant has \nnot seen his mother and siblings since 2014. He has worked in Iraq for a defense \ncontractor since 2017. He has not talked to any of his family in Iraq since he went to \nIraq in 2017. One of Applicant\u2019s brother worked for the U.S. military in Iraq as a linguist. \nWith the exception of one of his siblings who is a teacher, to his knowledge, none of his \nfamily members have any current connection to the Iraqi government. \n \n \nApplicant had an interpreter friend in Iraq. That friend immigrated to the United \nStates and is now a permanent resident. Applicant credibly testified that his family in \nIraq could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. \n \nApplicant submitted documents and letters from members of the U.S. military \nattesting to his outstanding service as a linguist and cultural advisor in support of \ncombat operations. One military officer wrote: \n \nI have had the pleasure of working with [Applicant] closely, especially \nduring the trying times of a combat deployment. I have always witnessed \n[Applicant] put his teammates and the mission before himself with no \ncomplaint. I have no doubt in [Applicant\u2019s] professional, personal \ncharacter, and love of country. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nAnother officer wrote: \n \nDespite living in the most austere, remote location in our particular combat \ntheater, [Applicant] always maintained a positive attitude and willingness \nto work around the clock to support our detachment\u2019s operations. \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n4 \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. The \npotential for terrorist violence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Iraq, \nand it continues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \npotential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant maintains contact with a friend who is a citizen \nand resident of Iraq. That friend is now a permanent resident of the United States. No \nsecurity concerns are generated by that friend. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable:  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n\n \n6 \n \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist for the U.S. military in \nIraq from about 2004 to 2010, which earned him a special immigrant visa. He returned \nto work in Iraq as a linguist and cultural advisor for a defense contractor about two years \nago. U.S. military personnel who worked with him praised his service. I find that \nApplicant can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the \nUnited States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Iraq earned him high praise from U.S. \nmilitary personnel. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of \naction in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n20, 2007). The complicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his foreign family members do not pose an \nunacceptable security risk. He has met that burden.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",
