She works as a claims\nprocessor for a defense contractor who provides health care services to Department of Defense\nemployees.  Applicant has 20 listed delinquent debts that she is addressing by her recent filing of\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.  Applicant mitigated the financial considerations\u2019 trustworthiness concern.\nHer eligibility for assignment to sensitive positions and for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is\ngranted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\nAdjudication of trustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions are resolved using the provisions of DoD\n2\nDirective 5220.6, pursuant to the memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004)\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nposition of trust for Applicant.  On December 11, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29,\n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006 .  Applicant\n2\nanswered the SOR in writing on January 17, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007.  On June 28, 2007, I convened\na hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were\nadmitted into evidence.  I left the record open for the submission of additional exhibits by Applicant.\nShe submitted them within the time period allowed.  The Government had no objection to them, and\nI admitted them as Exhibits B to D.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 27 years old, unmarried, and has two minor children.  She works for a defense\ncontractor in the health care management business as a claims processor.  She started this job in\nOctober 2003.  She earns about $2,100 a month, net income being $1,730 monthly.  Her monthly\nexpenses are about the same.  She is owed about $15,000 in child support from the father of her\nchildren.  Their relationship broke up sometime in the past two years.  Before her current\nemployment, Applicant had a series of clerk and cashier positions, paying minimum wage or slightly\nhigher. (Tr. 14, 16, 17, 37; Exhibits 1, 6, A)\nApplicant is now working on a budget for herself.  She admits she had children before she\nwas financially secure, but now has a full-time job and depends only on herself to take care of her\ntwo children.  Her current monthly expenses are paid on time and are not in a delinquent status.(Tr.\n26-30; Exhibits 1, 6)\nApplicant has 11 medical delinquent debts listed in the SOR (subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d, 1.f\nand 1.g, 1.k to 1.m, 1.p and 1.q.)  These debts total $7,919.11.  Applicant claims she had medical\ninsurance at her former employment positions and thought it paid these bills.  Applicant also has 9\nnon-medical delinquent debts (subparagraphs 1.e, 1.h to 1.j, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r to 1.t) which total\n$4,286.43.  The total of debts listed in the SOR is $12,205.54.  On June 20, 2007, Applicant filed\n\n4\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.  The total amount of her 30 listed debts in the bankruptcy is $26,140.\nApplicant has not yet been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Some of these debts dated from\n1998 with the latest referral for collection being January 2006.  She attended and completed the\nmandatory financial counseling required under the latest amendments to the Federal Bankruptcy\nLaw. (Tr. 13, 19; Exhibits 2-6, A-D)\nPOLICIES\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b62 of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Those assessments\ninclude:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior\nwas; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of\nparticipation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\n\n5\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security\nconcern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations:  The Government established by substantial evidence and\nApplicant\u2019s admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.  Applicant\u2019s debts arose from medical\nexpenses, telephone bills, and miscellaneous expenses.  Her income was and is insufficient to repay\nthese delinquent debts in a timely manner.  The disqualifying conditions applicable are Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b619.c.\n(a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on June 20, 2007, eight days prior to the hearing.\nWhile tardy in doing so, the magnitude of Applicant\u2019s debts, the separation from the father of her\ntwo children and whatever income he had, and her series of low-paying jobs, together made it\nunlikely she could never repay these debts without using bankruptcy.  Chapter 7 bankruptcy is the\nclassic solution provided under Federal law for such situations.  The Financial Considerations\nMitigating Conditions applicable are \u00b620.b (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\n\n6\nthe circumstances), and \u00b620.d (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts). \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in\nthe AG \u00b6 2(a) under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The majority of Applicant\u2019s financial problems\narose from medical bills she thought her health insurance coverage from her jobs between 1998 and\n2007, should have paid.  She knew she was not paying these bills, and the non-medical bills, but had\nno income to pay them beyond her monthly expenses for her family.  Applicant was in her early and\nmid-20s when these debts were incurred.  She exhibited a lack of maturity in having her children\nbefore she could afford to do so, as she admitted.  Now she realizes her responsibility better and\ndepends only on herself to take care of her family.  She did not deliberately fail to pay these\ndelinquent debts, but expected some to be paid by her medical insurance.  She seems to have learned\nto verify payments and not spend more than she earns.  Thus, there is minimal likelihood she  would\nengage in this conduct again.  With the Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, there is no potential for duress\nor coercion because her debts will be eliminated.  Applicant is credible in her explanations of the\nchanges in her life and her acceptance of increased individual financial responsibility.  Her testimony\nand actions demonstrate a greater maturity on her part as she raises two children alone, working full-\ntime, and paying her debts on time.\nTherefore, I conclude the financial responsibility trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I\nconclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.t:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  Her\napplication for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\n     \nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 3, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence)of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on  December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.

On June 27, 2007, I convened a hearing to\nconsider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted\ninto evidence.

After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 60 years old, married with one adult son, and works for a defense contractor in\nthe health care management business.  He works in the information systems area.  He has worked\nfor this employer for 28 years.  He was born on Taiwan, the Republic of China.  He immigrated to\nthe U.S. in 1971.

His\nmother became a U.S. citizen in April 2002.  She lives in the U.S.  Applicant and his wife own their\nown home in the U.S. and have since 1987.  He does not own any property in Taiwan or any other\nforeign country. (Tr. 16, 18, 22, 26-28; Exhibits 1 and A)\nApplicant\u2019s 93-year-old father lives on Taiwan.  He is a citizen of the Republic of China.\nHe is infirm, confined to a wheelchair, and suffers from cancer.  Applicant does not expect him to\nlive much longer because of his age and the variety of his ailments.  Applicant\u2019s father is retired from\nthe Central Bank of China, and receives a pension from the Taiwanese government.  Applicant\u2019s\nbrother is a resident and citizen of the Republic of China on Taiwan.  He is four years younger than\nApplicant.  He operates a trading company he owns.  He has had this company for about 20 years.\nApplicant and his brother do not have a close relationship and they talk on the telephone only when\nApplicant travels to see his father on Taiwan.  Applicant calls his brother before he departs from the\nU.S., and after he returns to it.  He has a sister who lives in the U.S. with whom his mother lives.\nHis younger sister came to the U.S. before Applicant did in 1971.  Applicant traveled to Taiwan to\nvisit his father in 1995, 2000, 2003, 2004, and 2005.  No one from the Taiwanese government\napproached Applicant about obtaining any information Applicant might have from his work.  All of\nhis wife\u2019s family now lives in the U.S. (Tr. 15-21; Exhibit 1, Answer)\n\n4\nApplicant visited the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) in 2004 and 2006 for vacation\npurposes.  He traveled with a group consisting of his wife, her sister and husband, and 10 people\nfrom Singapore.  He hiked and saw various sites throughout parts of the PRC.  Applicant has no\nbusiness in the PRC.  He told his supervisor and another superior that he was going to the PRC for\ntwo weeks vacation.  He was not approached or contacted by anyone from the PRC seeking\ninformation during his visit.  Applicant had workplace training regarding safeguarding sensitive\nmaterial. (Tr. 18-26; Exhibit 1, Answer)\nI take administrative notice of the island of Taiwan being the Republic of China, and not the\nPRC, which is located on the mainland of China.  Taiwan and the PRC engage in industrial and\nmilitary espionage designed to collect proprietary and classified information.  The greater bulk of\nthe information presented in the administrative notice documents pertains to the PRC activities in\nindustrial and military espionage.  Industrial espionage is intelligence gathering by a foreign country\nor a foreign company with its government\u2019s help against a private U.S. company to obtain\ncommercial secrets.  Taiwan collects primarily industrial information for commercial purposes.  The\nadministrative notice exhibit included two examples of Taiwan collecting, in one case, classified\ngovernment data, and in the other collecting commercial information to enable one of its\nmanufacturing companies to compete directly with a U.S. company.  The U.S. has formal diplomatic\nrelations with the PRC, but since 1979 has not had formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan.  The\nU.S. sells Taiwan military equipment and does billions of dollars of trade with Taiwan annually.  It\nalso does billions of dollars of trade with the PRC annually.  Taiwan is a multiparty democracy of\n22 million people, with an elected president and legislature.  The PRC is a one-party authoritarian\ngovernment which has a record of human rights abuses.

May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline B:  The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. \u00b66\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n6\nForeign Influence:  Applicant\u2019s connection to Taiwan results from his birth, and his 93-\nyear-old father, and his younger brother, continuing to live there.  Applicant has contact with his\nfather out of familial obligations.  His contact with his brother is limited to telephone calls about\nApplicant\u2019s travel to and from Taiwan for the family visits, and contact with him while Applicant\nvisits their father.  Applicant has no financial or property interests in Taiwan or the PRC.\nApplicant\u2019s contact with the PRC occurred in 2004 and 2006 on personal trips he took with a group\nfor site-seeing purposes only.\nUnder the above facts, the condition that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, which is applicable here is \u00b67.a (contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen\nof or a resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).  \nThe mitigating conditions \u00b68.a (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of the foreign individual and the interests of the U.S.), and \u00b68.b (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person\nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterests) apply.  Applicant is not going to be placed in any position by his father, confined to a\nwheelchair suffering from cancer and retired from work, and forced to make a choice between the\nTaiwanese government and the U.S.  His father is not involved in any business or government\nactivity.  He is trying to stay alive, and Applicant\u2019s visits are the actions of a dutiful son toward his\ndying father.  Applicant\u2019s brother is in a private business with no visible connection to the health\ncare business for which Applicant works.  Neither relative is involved in any activity which might\nbenefit from any U.S. trustworthiness information.\nFurthermore, Applicant has been a U.S. citizen for 24 years, and lived in the U.S. for 33\nyears.  He has worked for the same employer for 28 years.  His mother and sister live in the U.S. and\nare citizens of the U.S.  His wife is a U.S. citizen since 1984.  Applicant\u2019s son was born in the U.S.\nApplicant owns a home in the U.S.  His ties to these people in the U.S., and to the U.S. by himself,\nare obviously stronger than his ties to his father and brother who remained in Taiwan.  The same\nanalysis applies to Applicant\u2019s two pleasure trips to the PRC, where no one approached him about\nhis health care business employment.  I give great weight to Applicant\u2019s sincere and frank\npresentation, and the depth of his connections to the U.S. over Taiwan or the PRC.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b62(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b66.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b62(a).  In evaluating\nApplicant\u2019s case, I considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b62(a).  Because\n\n7\nforeign influence does not involve misconduct, only the eight factor (the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress) is relevant.\nThere are many countervailing positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that\nweigh in favor of granting him a security clearance. He has extensive and long-term contacts with\nthe U.S.  He has lived here since 1974, and been a citizen since 1984.  His wife became a U.S.\ncitizen in 1984.  His mother and sister immigrated to the U.S. and became citizens.  He has worked\nfor the same employer for 28 years.  He owns a home in the U.S., and has no property or financial\ninterests in any other country.  His son was born in the U.S.  He is a loyal American committed to\nhis family and his job in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s visits to his father are not serious misconduct, or misconduct of any type.  They\nare merely visits to a dying parent.  Applicant has  minimal contact with is younger brother during\nthese visits.  His visits to his father are voluntary, based on what he thinks his family obligations are\nas the oldest child.  His father is 93 and confined to a wheelchair.  When his father dies his visits will\ncease.  There is no likelihood of coercion or pressure because his father cannot put any pressure on\nhim due to his illness, age, retired status, and struggle to stay alive.  Applicant\u2019s brother is not in the\nhealth care business, so he would have no interest in any information on the computers that\nApplicant maintains for his employer.  Applicant does not have the type of new industrial or military\ndevelopments within his job that any espionage would be directed to collect.  It is not likely that the\nTaiwanese or PRC governments would coerce Applicant to get information on patient health care.\nIn addition to the above facts, trustworthiness determinations are predictive judgments and\nthe best predictor of future performance is past performance.  Based on a review of his history and\nsubstantial ties to the United States, I conclude Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation by Taiwan, a\ndemocratic ally of the United States, appears low and unlikely to occur.\nTherefore, I conclude the foreign influence trustworthiness concern for Applicant.  I conclude\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d trustworthiness concern for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue  eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.  His\napplication for eligibility for a public trust position is granted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

In an 18 month period from\nJune 2002 to March 2004, she had five security violations.  The violations were mostly minor and\ndue to inadvertence.  Two violations involved a failure to properly spin a safe dial lock so the lock\nengaged.  One violation was leaving documents unattended in a kitchen area in a secure facility.\nAnother violation was Applicant\u2019s failure to set a room alarm because Applicant believed another\nperson was still in the room.  The other violation was a failure to properly engage a room alarm that\nApplicant believed she had set.  Applicant at all times, and since the incidents, has shown a positive\nattitude towards security rules and procedures.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 5, 2006.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under Guideline K (Security Violations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nthe Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 13, 2006.  She admitted all of the\nallegations under both Guidelines with a detailed explanation.  She requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge, and the request was received by DOHA on September 15, 2006.  Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed with the case on January 23, 2007, and the case was assigned to\nme on January 29, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 9, 2007, and the hearing\nconvened on February 28, 2007.  Ten government exhibits, marked Government Exhibits 1-10, and\nthe testimony of one Government witness were received without objection.  Seven Applicant\nexhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits A-G, and the testimony of the Applicant and three Applicant\nwitnesses were received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nessential findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old theoretical researcher for a defense contractor.  She has a\nbachelor\u2019s degree in general mathematics, a master\u2019s degree in mathematics topology with specialty\nin theoretical applications, and a doctorate in mathematics topology with a sub-specialty in\nprobability and statistics from the same university.  Upon receiving her doctorate in 1980, she and\nher then husband commenced working for a defense contractor on the west coast.  She was with\nthem for six years before she left after the birth of her daughter.  While working with that defense\ncontractor, she held a security clearance and worked with classified information.  She never had a\nsecurity violation.  In addition, her supervisor in that position, highly praised her for sound technical\nskills and a sense of judgment that was greater than her years of experience.  He states she had no\n\nTr. 92-96; 90; Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated February, 6, 1998); Appellant\n1\nExhibit G (Letter, dated February 10, 2007).\nGovernment Exhibit 9 (Security Acknowledgment signed by Applicant, various dates); Government Exhibit\n2\n10 (Security briefing sign-in sheets and briefing slides, February 2003).\nTr. 28-31, 100-101.\n3\nTr. 13-18; Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated February 16, 2005); Government Exhibit 3\n4\n(Administrative Inquiry, dated June 20, 2002).\nTr. 18-20, 31-33,: Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated February 16, 2005); Government\n5\nExhibit 4 (Administrative Inquiry, dated January 21, 2003).\n3\nsecurity violations while employed by the company.  He has seen her numerous times since she left\nthe company and notes her skill, demeanor, and outlook have not changed.  In 2000 after a divorce\nand when her daughter was 14-years-old, Applicant rejoined the work force with a defense contractor\nthat was later purchased by her present employer.  Applicant now works in a different facility than\nwhere the security violations occurred because her employer needed her specific skills at that\nlocation.1\nBetween June 2002 and March 2004, Applicant committed five security rules violations.  The\nprocedures Applicant failed to follow were all directed or required by the National Intelligence\nSecurity Procedures Manual (NISPOM) or by the contract awarded to her company by the\ngovernment.  The first four were considered minor violations, but the fifth was considered a major\nviolation.  Applicant was fully briefed on the security requirements of her company.  She attended\nthe briefings required for access to closed areas of the company.2\nOn June 18, 2002, Applicant removed documents no longer needed from her safe to return\nto document control.  The document control clerk was busy so Applicant went to a kitchen area to\nget a coffee or soda drink.  A co-worker entered the kitchen area and they engaged in conversation.\nApplicant left the kitchen area without retrieving the documents.  About 25 minutes later, another\nco-worker entered the kitchen and found the classified documents.   Applicant\u2019s employer\n3\ninvestigated the incident and determined there was no compromise of classified information since\nthe kitchen was in a controlled access area of the facility.  Applicant was orally counseled by her\nsupervisor and the facility security manager and told to be more careful in handling classified\ndocuments.4\nApplicant shared a drawer in a safe containing classified documents with a co-worker.  The\nsafe was located in a closed secure area of the facility.  The safe drawer had a combination lock to\nsecure the drawer and a handle to pull down to open the drawer.  The combination lock had to be\nproperly spun to lock the drawer and the handle.  A check sheet had to be signed and initialed when\nunlocking and locking the combination lock and drawer.  At 1715 hours on January 20, 2003, a co-\nworker checked Applicant\u2019s safe drawer to ensure it was locked for the night.  When he pulled down\non the handle, the safe opened since the combination had not been properly secured.  Applicant was\nthe last person to sign the check sheet at 1345 hours.  She admitted that she inadvertently did not\nensure the combination dial was spun to lock the safe.  The safe was unsecured for approximately\n3 hours and 30 minutes.  The incident was investigated by the defense contractor and it was\ndetermined there was no compromise of classified information since the safe was located in a secure\nclosed area accessible only to properly cleared individuals.   On June 17, 2003, the same safe drawer\n5\n\nTr. 21-23, 31-34; Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated February 16, 2005); Government Exhibit\n6\n5 (Administrative Inquiry, dated June 20, 2003).\nTr. 34-37; Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s statement, dated February 16, 2005); Government Exhibit 6\n7\n(Administrative Inquiry, dated September 23, 2003; Government Exhibit 7 (Notice of Violation, dated October 10,\n2003).\nTr. 43-50, 52-54; Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant\u2019s statement. Dated February 16, 2005); Government\n8\nExhibit 8 (Administrative inquiry, dated March 19, 2004).\n4\nwas unlocked when checked for the day at 1615 hour.  Applicant was the last person to sign for\nopening or closing the drawer at 1600 hours.  The safe had been left unsecured for approximately\n15 minutes.  The incident was investigated and it was determined there was no compromise of\nclassified documents since the safe was located in the secure closed area.  After both of these\nincidents, Applicant was counseled by the company vice-president, her direct supervisor, and the \nfacility security manager.  After the June 17, 2003, incident, Applicant was temporarily not permitted\nto enter the secure area without an escort.6\nOn September 26, 2003, Applicant entered a room controlled by an alarm, a cipher lock, and\na card reader.  Approximately 50 people assigned to the area had access to the room.  When\nApplicant entered the room she checked to see if anyone was in the room and located another person\nworking in an area not visible from all areas of the room.  The protocol was for anyone entering the\nroom to tell others in the room when they entered or left the room. Applicant was only in the room\na few minutes.  The other person in the room left in the meantime without informing Applicant he\nwas leaving.  Applicant left the room without setting the alarm because she believed the other person\nwas still in the room.  A third person entered the room seven minutes later and discovered the alarm\nhad not been set and the room was unoccupied.  Applicant admitted, and the card reader showed, that\nshe was the last person to leave the room with the alarm not set.  The incident was investigated and\ndetermined there was no compromise of classified information since the card reader showed that\nonly cleared individuals had entered the room.  Applicant received a verbal and written reprimand\nfrom her supervisor and the facility security manager.7\nAt 1710 hours on March 16, 2004, Applicant left a closed area.  The area had an alarm armed\nfrom inside the room, and a cipher lock spin dial and a card reader access engaged from outside the\nroom.  Applicant signed the log as the last person to leave the room that evening.  She had a co-\nworker check the cipher lock to be sure it was engaged.  When the room was entered at 0816 hours\nthe following day, the cipher lock was engaged but the alarm was not armed.  Procedures require the\nalarm to be armed and activated and the cipher lock engaged.  Applicant remembers activating the\nalarm before leaving the room.  The company conducted an inquiry and determined there was no\nequipment malfunction and no compromise of classified information because the room had not been\naccessed since Applicant engaged the cipher lock.  This was considered a major violation merely\nbecause of the length of time the alarm was not engaged.  Applicant was again counseled by the\nfacility security manager.8\n\nAppellant Exhibit A (List of awards and certificates, dated, January 29, 2007).\n9\nAppellant Exhibit B (Performance Appraisals, 2000 to 2006).\n10\nAppellant Exhibit C (messages of appreciation, various dates).\n11\nAppellant Exhibit D (Examples of security concerns, various dates).\n12\nAppellant Exhibit E (Memorandum, dated April 12, 2004).\n13\nAppellant Exhibit F (Letter, dated February 7, 2007).\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Her\n9\nperformance appraisals show she is among the best employees in her field.   She has received\n10\nnumerous letters of appreciation from the government program managers that she serves.   \n11\nAppellant has been concerned about security issues and problems for her company.  She has\nquestioned certain practices and recommended actions to enhance security issues for the company.12\nThe vice-president of her company counseled her on security violations.  He felt the security\nviolations were caused by a lack of concentration on her part because of her busy work requirements.\nHe discussed with her ways to avoid future violations.  She has taken the necessary steps to minimize\nthe violations in the future.  He highly praised her work and her dedication.   The security manager\n13\nof the facility where Appellant has been located since July 20, 2004, notes that there have been no\nsecurity violations by Appellant since she moved to that facility.   \n14\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n15\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.16\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access\nto classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the\nDirective \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\n\nId.\n17\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.1 through E2.2.1.9.\n18\nSee Exec.

An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n17\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.18\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n19\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.20\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n21\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n22\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition. \u201c[T]he\n23\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n24\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 25\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.  Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following\n\n7\nadjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline K - Noncompliance with security regulations raises doubts about an individual\u2019s\ntrustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nUnder Guideline K (Security Violations), a security concern exists because noncompliance\nwith security regulations raises doubt as to an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, and willingness and ability\nto safeguard classified information.  Appellant\u2019s five security violations raises Security Violations\nDisqualifying Condition Directive \u00b6 E2.A11.1.2.2. (violations that are deliberate or multiple or due\nto negligence).  While the violations were inadvertent and not deliberate, there were five violations\nso there are multiple violations due to Applicant\u2019s negligence.  I conclude the Security Violations\nDisqualifying Condition has been established.\nI considered all the Security Violations Mitigating Conditions (SV MC).  Since there were five\nviolations over an 18 month period, the violations were not isolated and are frequent so SV MC\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.2 (Were isolated or infrequent) does not apply.  Since there is clear evidence\nApplicant received proper and adequate training on security rules from her company, SV MC Directive\n\u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.3 (Were due to improper or inadequate training) does not apply.  However, the\nadministrative inquiries into the violations conducted by her employer and the circumstances of the\nviolations clearly shows that they were inadvertent so SV MC Directive \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.1 (Were\ninadvertent) applies.  Also, the information from Applicant\u2019s facility security manager and Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor clearly shows that she is fully aware of security rules and is positive in applying them.  The\nviolations were mostly technical violations that occurred while Applicant was attempting to follow the\nrules.  In two of the violations, she locked the safe but did not fully spin the locking dial to lock the\nsafe.  In another violation, she believed another person was still in the room since the person did not\ntell her he was leaving.  She did not set the alarm believing the room was occupied.  In another\nviolation, she thought she set the room alarm for the night but misapplied the alarming procedures.\nShe did lock the room and have it double checked by another employee.  The only truly negligent act\nwas leaving the documents in the kitchen.  The evidence clearly shows Applicant is a positive force\nin her company in examining company practices so they comply with the security rules.  She has\nestablished and demonstrated a positive attitude towards the discharge of security responsibilities, so\nSV MC Directive \u00b6 E2.A11.1.3.4 (Demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of security\nresponsibilities) applies.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns for security\nviolations under Guideline K.  \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct), there is a security concern for conduct that involves\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\n\n8\nregulations.  Such conduct could indicate that a person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  Applicant\u2019s five security violations raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A5.1.2.5 (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations).  Applicant\u2019s conduct was not\ndishonest but she did violate security rules, so the disqualifying condition is established.  The personal\nconduct mitigating condition that applies to Applicant is Directive \u00b6 E2.A5.1.3.1 (the information was\nunsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability).\nWhile the information substantiates the rules violations, the violations were minor, inadvertent, and\ndue to simple negligence by Applicant while she was attempting to comply with the security rules.\nI conclude she has also mitigated the security concerns under personal conduct. \nI carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept and apply\na fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  Applicant\u2019s  actions were not questionable judgment and\ndo not indicate untrustworthiness, unreliability or an unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations.  At all times, she was conscious of the security requirements and was attempting to\ncomply with them.  The violations were technical, inadvertent, and generally minor.  In fact, the record\nshows she has good judgment, is trustworthy, and reliable.  She willingly follows and embraces rules\nand regulations pertaining to security.  I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified\ninformation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline K:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Savarino, Esquire\nSYNOPSIS\nThe government\u2019s evidence failed to establish that Applicant was at heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of his limited family\nconnections to Bangladesh. Eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position granted.\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  2\n1\nJanuary 1992\u2014as amended and modified, most recently in August 2006 (Directive). Adjudication of this case is\ncontrolled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on December 29, 2005,which were\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on 31 August 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the\nguidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations\nin which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nINS functions have been transferred to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the organization has\n2\nbeen renamed Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 5 March 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his eligibility for an ADP I/II/III\nposition because of unresolved foreign influence concerns.  He answered the SOR 27 April 2007,\n1\nand requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 14 June 2007, and I convened a hearing 23\nJuly 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 1 August 2007.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate those admissions\nas findings of fact. He is a 33-year-old quality assurance manager for a defense contractor, and seeks\naccess to sensitive personnel information. He has not previously had a background investigation. \nApplicant was born in Bangladesh in July 1973, and grew up there. He immigrated to the\nU.S. in 1996, when he won the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)  diversity lottery,\n2\nawarding him legal permanent resident (LPR) status. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April\n2002, and obtained his first U.S. passport in June 2002. He applied for the diversity lottery because\nof his dream to come to the U.S. to study and be able to work (Tr. 40). He attended community\ncollege in the U.S. before transferring to a university to complete his undergraduate degree in\ncomputer science in January 2002. All his financial assets are in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and his two sisters are resident citizens of Bangladesh. His father is a\ncivil attorney with no government affiliation. His mother is a life-long housewife. Applicant provides\nthem no financial support, and he receives none from them. His two sisters are housewives. One is\nmarried to an attorney who was an associate with her father before striking out on his own. The other\nis married to an accountant. None of the four of them have any affiliation with the government of\nBangladesh.\nApplicant has sponsored his parents and siblings to immigrate to the U.S. (A.E. D). His\nparents\u2019 petitions have been approved, and they await final processing through the U.S. Department\nof State National Visa Center. His sisters\u2019 petitions are still pending, but siblings occupy a lower\npriority than parents of U.S. citizens, and generally must wait longer to have their petitions approved.\n\n3\n Applicant has 25-30 cousins who are resident citizens of Bangladesh. He sees them\noccasionally when he travels to Bangladesh to visit family, as he has done in December 1998,\nDecember 2000, December 2003, July 2006, and February 2007. He has no contact with any of them\nwhen he is in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the last three years in the quality assurance division testified that\nApplicant is an excellent software tester, and handles sensitive information appropriately (Tr. 29).\nApplicant completes on-line security training annually to stay apprised of security requirements (Tr.\n57).\nBangladesh obtained its independence from Pakistan in 1971, and pursuant to its 1972\nconstitution, has a democratic parliamentary form of government. It is one of the world's poorest and\nmost densely populated countries, with a population of 146 million people and a per capita GDP of\n$456. Bangladesh remains one of the few democracies in the Muslim world, but suffers from a\ndysfunctional political system, weak governance, and pervasive corruption. Nevertheless,\nBangladeshis regard democracy as an important legacy of their war for independence. However in\nJanuary 2007, the government declared a state of emergency, suspended certain fundamental rights,\nand postponed the scheduled January 2007 elections until late 2008.\nDespite a poor human rights record, Bangladesh is generally a force for moderation in\ninternational forums, and is also a long-time leader in international peacekeeping operations. Its\nactivities in international organizations, with other governments, and its regional partners to promote\nhuman rights, democracy, and free markets are coordinated and high profile. U.S.-Bangladesh\nrelations are excellent. Further, Bangladesh has become a valuable U.S. ally in the global war on\nterrorism. While Bangladesh has witnessed the emergence of a dangerous terrorist group, the JMB,\nwhich has identified the governments of the U.S. and the United Kingdom as alleged enemies of\nIslam and has the goal of imposing a fundamentalist Islamic society on Bangladesh, the government\nhas banned the group and pursues its leaders to limit its effectiveness in Bangladesh. There was no\nJMB-linked violence in 2006, and U.S. and Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies cooperated well\non several cases related to domestic and international terrorism.\nBangladesh is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence or sensitive economic information.\nBangladesh is not known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. Bangladesh is not\non the U.S. Department of State\u2019s list of current travel warnings, although the State Department\nnotes that the security situation in Bangladesh remains fluid.\nApplicant\u2019s roommate, a former college friend, is\u2014like Applicant\u2014a native-born\nBangladeshi who became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In January 2007, the roommate was granted his\neligibility for an ADP I/II/III position administratively by DOHA based on an SOR and answer that\nare virtually indistinguishable from Applicant\u2019s, except that Applicant has cousins in addition to\nparents and siblings living in Bangladesh (SOR 1.c.)(A.E. A-C). The roommate was a listed contact\non Applicant\u2019s application (G.E. 1).\n\n A memorandum from Carol A. Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Counterintelligence and\n3\nSecurity to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases (Nov. 19, 2004), directed that adjudication of\ntrustworthiness cases for ADP I, II, and III positions be resolved using the provisions of the Directive rather than, as\noriginally drafted, DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, DoD Personnel Security Program, as amended (Regulation). Positions\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions in section AP10.2.1 of the Regulation. ADP III\npositions are nonsensitive positions. (Regulation, AP102.3.1) By virtue of the aforementioned memorandum, however,\neven though they are nonsensitive positions, ADP III cases are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same\nguidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n4\nPOLICIES AND BURDENS\nThe Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to sensitive information.  Administrative Judges must assess both\n3\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.4\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n5\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n6\n5\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n5\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.6\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B.\nConsidering first the foreign country involved, Bangladesh and the U.S. enjoy excellent foreign\nrelations. However, while Bangladesh has a poor human rights record, it is a voice of moderation\nin its international relations, promotes democracy in its region, and has actively cooperated with the\nU.S. in ending global terrorism. Bangladesh is not known to target protected U.S. information, nor\nis it known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information. Further, this case contains\nevidence that the government has concluded, in at least one case, that Bangladesh poses insufficient\nrisk of targeting protected information. While Department Counsel correctly observes that DOHA\u2019s\ndecision to grant eligibility in ADP Case No. 05-11711 (A.E. C) does not specifically address\nBangladesh and lacks precedential value for this case, Department Counsel is incorrect in suggesting\nthat DOHA\u2019s decision does not support favorable inferences about the government\u2019s overall view\nof the risk posed by Bangladesh. In addition, the only other DOHA case to have considered\nBangladesh under the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (ISCR Case No. 06-14160) similarly\nconcluded that Bangladesh posed insufficient risk to protected information. Again, that decision has\nno precedential value for this case, but does provide support for my conclusion that Bangladesh\nneither seeks protected information from the U.S. nor targets its former citizens to obtain that\ninformation. The risk that Bangladesh might seek protected information from Applicant is low, if\nnot non-existent.\nOn the Applicant side of the equation, the government produced no evidence that there was\nany risk, much less a heightened risk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Bangladesh. Applicant has sponsored\nhis parents and sisters for immigration to the U.S. His parents\u2019 petitions have been approved. None\nof Applicant\u2019s immediate family members (or his sisters\u2019 husbands) have any affiliation with the\ngovernment of Bangladesh. He contacts his cousins only when he is in Bangladesh, and he does not\nalways see the same cousins when he travels to Bangladesh. There is nothing in the circumstances\nof their being in Bangladesh, or in Applicant\u2019s contacts with his parents and sisters, to heighten the\nrisk that he could be impelled to provide protected information to Bangladesh. I resolve Guideline\nB for Applicant.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n   Paragraph 1. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the information presented, it is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security to grant Applicant a position of public trust.\n \nJohn G.

(Item 4)  In September 2003, his employer filed an adverse information report \nbased on arrests for driving while intoxicated. (Item 5)  On September 21, 2007, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nfor Applicant detailing security concerns for alcohol consumption and personal conduct \nunder Guidelines G and E. (Item 1)  The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 23. 2007. (Item 3)  Applicant \nadmitted all factual allegations, and elected to have the matter decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing.  Department counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ncase on December 12, 2007.  Applicant received a complete file of relevant material \n(FORM) on January 7, 2008, and was provided the opportunity to file objections, and \nsubmit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant \ndid not submit additional information.  The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2008.  \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant admitted all factual allegations under both guidelines G and E.  The \nallegation under Guideline E pertains to Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol at work.  \nParagraph 16 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concerns for \nPersonal Conduct.  Under & 16(c), a disqualifying condition may arise where there is \nAcredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for \nan adverse determination under any other single guideline . . . .@  Paragraph 16(d) \napplies where there is credible adverse information Athat is not sufficient to support \naction under another guideline . . . .@  In this case, the information is sufficient to raise a \nsecurity concern for alcohol consumption under guideline G and is fully supported under \nguideline G.  The new adjudicative guidelines make allegations of personal conduct \nbased solely on alcohol consumption, improper for security consideration.  Since none \nof the information raises separate security concerns under personal conduct, that \nsecurity concern need not be discussed further in this decision.  Accordingly, the \nallegation and security concern under guideline E will not be further discussed in this \ndecision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and employed as a woodwright for a defense contractor \nfor over 8 years.  He is divorced but has two children from his marriage. \n \nApplicant admitted that he was arrested for underage drinking and driving while \nintoxicated in 1975.  He admitted he was arrested in 1994 for driving while intoxicated, \ndriving with a blood alcohol level above .10, and failure to provide proof of insurance.  \nHe pled guilty to driving while intoxicated, and the other charges were dismissed.  He \nwas sentenced to 12 months unsupervised probation, a fine of $444.50, to attend \nalcohol counseling, and to speak at Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) events. \n(Item 8)  Applicant admitted he was arrested and found guilty of driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol in November 2002.  He was sentenced to a fine of $475, \nunsupervised probation, to attend alcohol evaluation, education, and treatment, 10 days \nin jail, and to speak at MADD Victim Impact Panels.  He admitted he was arrested for \ndriving under the influence of alcohol and other traffic offenses in September 2003.  He \npled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and was fined $475, sentenced to \nserve 15 days in jail, 12 months unsupervised probation, to attend alcohol evaluation, \neducation, and treatment, and to speak at MADD Victim Impact Panels. (Item 7) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admits he has consumed alcohol, usually beer, his entire adult life, at \ntimes to excess.  His present consumption of alcohol is at least two beers a day, usually \nat home or on his way home.  He admitted in an August 2004 statement, that for the \neight days before the statement he consumed about 25 beers.  He admits that in 2002, \nhis daily consumption of beer was about ten a day.  Alcohol use was an issue causing \nhis divorce.  His children have commented to him about his drinking and urged him to \nstop.  He has not attempted to stop drinking alcohol and still admits to drinking alcohol \ndaily, but he has moderated his consumption of alcohol. (Item 7)  He has been \ndiagnosed by a licensed clinical social worker as alcohol dependent and a problem \ndrinker. (Item 9) \n \nApplicant admits that in 1994, he left his position with another company after he \nfell asleep on the job.  The company claimed he was drinking alcohol on the job.  \nApplicant stated he ate some bad turkey which caused him to fall asleep. (Item 7 at 4-5) \n \nApplicant states he drinks alcohol to relax after a hard day of work.  He is never \nviolent and his alcohol consumption has not resulted in financial hardship.  He makes \nenough money to pay his debts and his taxes.  He has not attempted to stop drinking \nbut has cut back for fear of going to jail. (Item 7 at 4) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrests for minor in possession of alcohol, and driving while \nintoxicated, as well as drinking alcohol to excess, consuming over ten beers per day, \nand his family\u2019s concerns about his alcohol consumption raise Alcohol Consumption \nDisqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, \nsuch as driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed \nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and AC DC \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  The driving while \nintoxicated incidents are alcohol-related incidents away from work.  His consumption of \nmore than ten beers a day and his family\u2019s concerns are indications of binge or habitual \nconsumption of alcohol.  Applicant leaving his employment by mutual agreement \nbecause he fell asleep on the job and the employer\u2019s allegation he was drinking on the \njob raises AC DC \u00b6 22(c) (alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work \nor duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).  The \ndiagnoses of alcohol dependence and problem drinking by a licensed clinical social \nworker raises (AC DC) \u00b6 22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram). \n \n \nSecurity concerns for excess alcohol consumption can be mitigated by \nconsideration of Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much \n\n \n5 \n \n \ntimes has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent driving under the influence of alcohol incident was in 2003.  He was diagnosed \nas alcohol dependent and a problem drinker in 2004.  He admits to the continued daily \nconsumption of alcohol.  He has a history of alcohol abuse.  His last alcohol-related \nincident was in 2003.  There are at least five alcohol-related incidents which show that \nhis alcohol related behavior is not infrequent.  Because of his continued consumption of \nalcohol and no indications of any attempts to stop consumption, the alcohol-related \nincidents are likely to occur.   \n \nApplicant does not acknowledge he has alcohol-related problems even though \nthe issue was raised by his family.  He has taken no action to overcome his alcohol \nproblems but merely states that he cut down his consumption.  He still continues to \nconsume at least two beers a day.  AC MC \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (of an alcohol abuser) does not apply.   \n \nApplicant has not participated in or sought alcohol counseling, even though he \nparticipated in some alcohol education programs after two of his driving while \nintoxicated convictions.  He has not received a favorable prognosis concerning his \nalcohol consumption.  He has not participated in any alcohol rehabilitation or treatment \nprograms.  AC DC 22(c) (the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress), and AC DC 22(d) (the individual has successfully \ncompleted inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required \naftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in \nmeetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social \nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) do not apply.  \nI find that Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for alcohol consumption. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating \nApplicant\u2019s security worthiness.  I considered that Applicant had alcohol-related \nincidents for many years and continues to drink alcohol.  He has not participated in any \nalcohol counseling, even though he did participate in some alcohol education programs \nafter two of his driving while intoxicated events.  He has not admitted he has an alcohol \nproblem even though his family has concerns about his alcohol consumption.  Applicant \nhas not presented sufficient information to show that his consumption of alcohol is not a \nsecurity concern.  I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are; \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nDISMISSED \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nDismissed \n \nDECISION \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.  \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________ \nThomas M.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 40-year-old shipyard worker employed by a government contractor, mitigated\nsecurity concerns arising from five alleged delinquent debts by establishing that three of the\nallegations related to one credit card debt that was been paid. The remaining two debts to a bank and\na municipal government were also paid. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn January 20, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn April 21, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The\nmatter was assigned to me on March 29, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on May 8, 2007, for\na hearing on May 31, 2007, and held that day. The government offered nine exhibits and Applicant\noffered seven at the hearing. All were accepted into evidence. The transcript was received on June\n20, 2007. The record was left open for 30 days and extended until October 30 for additional exhibits.\nDocuments were offered by Applicant on July 12, 2007, September 17, 2007, October 9, 2007, and\nOctober 30, 2007. All were accepted in evidence without objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all but one of the five allegations concerning delinquent debts in the SOR\nsince one was a duplicate. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor who works as a painter in a\nshipyard. He has been employed by the same company for 18 years and requires a security clearance\nto have access to his work. An analysis of the delinquent debts shows the following:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Delinquent debt of $2,500 with $30 costs subject to judgment and order to pay\ndated November 18, 2005 (Exh. C) based on a 1999 judgment. A aw firm is collection agent\nfor the creditor, a trust.\n2. Par. 1.b.: Delinquent debt of $5,200 based on a bank loan accepted by Applicant by\ncashing a check received in the mail from the bank. The debt was fully paid as of November\n22, 2005 (Exh. E).\n3. Par. 1.c.: Delinquent debt of $2,500 which the government agreed is for the same debt as\nPar. 1.a. (Exh. C).\n4. Par. 1.d.: Municipal taxes of $2,053 due for local garbage collection fees. This debt arose\nas a result of purchase of a house by Applicant with an outstanding lien for several years of\nback taxes assessed against the seller at time of purchase (Tr. 18 and Exh. D). All taxes now\nhave been paid (Exhs. H and J 3).\n5. Par. 1.e.: Discover credit card debt of $3,948 was owed (Exh. A). The debt was satisfied\nas of May 15, 2006 (Exh. F). Applicant established that this debt  is also the same debt as\nalleged in Par. 1.a. and 1.c. since he had only one credit card (Exhs. J 1 and 2, and Tr. 16, 35\n\n3\nand 36). \n6. Par. 1.f.: Allegation that Applicant\u2019s family income is less than their expenses. Evidence\nproduced at the hearing of current financial resources shows increase in total family income\nsufficient to pay delinquent debts and current expenses that will not result in additional\ndelinquent debts (Exh. G and Tr. 43). \nApplicant is unmarried but has lived with a woman for over 20 years who is the mother of\ntheir three sons ages 18, 14 and 13. They concede that they did not budget correctly or manage\nfinances well for several years. She now has two jobs, one as a teacher and a second providing health\ncare for the brain-injured. They sought credit counseling and were advised to refinance their home.\nThey did so and used the money from it to pay debts including the city garbage taxes and the\nDiscover credit card debt which was in collection by a law firm and alleged as three separate debts.\nThe settlement attorney for the home  refinancing made most of the distributions directly to creditors\n(Exh. H 4). \nThe monthly income for the family from three employers is over $7,000 (Exh. G). They have\nowned a home since 1994 and are current on mortgage payments of $1,300 per month. They have\n$1,300 in their checking account and have one 401(k) account. Their most recent auto purchase was\nfor a three year old car and they are current on their auto payments.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7\n3.1(b).\n\n4\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of financial security concern under\nGuideline F since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence\nof inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) might\ninclude the fact that the person has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.). \nThe government conceded at the hearing that the two debts alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. and c.;were\nduplicates, Applicant testified at the hearing that he also believed the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.e. was\nthe same as the other two. The testimony from both family members was persuasive that there was\nonly one credit card debt and that it was paid. Applicant was able to establish this fact in his latest\npost-hearing submission (Exh. J). He has settled the remainder of the debts to my satisfaction. The\ncited mitigating condition is applicable. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has\nsufficient family income to insure that there is little likelihood of a  recurrence of financial problems.\nHe is assisted by his companion of 20 years, the mother of their children, who has two responsible\njobs and is fully involved in the financial management of the family. They candidly admitted their\nfinancial over-extensions in the past and now have learned to live within their means. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that a security clearance should be granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\n\n5\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is a veteran who now is retired and works for a defense contractor. (Item 4, Response to FORM) Applicant was arrested on April 9, 1979, for grand larceny after trust and petty larceny. He worked in a restaurant when it was discovered that $1,100 was missing from the office safe. Applicant had access, along with other employees, to the safe. Applicant was represented by an attorney and upon his advice plead guilty to the petty larceny, a misdemeanor offense. The felony charge of grand larceny was dismissed for want of prosecution. Convicted of the petty larceny charge, Applicant paid a fine of $100, ordered to spend six months in jail, and ordered to serve 12 months probation, but that probation was stricken by the court. Applicant did not disclose these arrests on his security clearance application (SCA) that was originally submitted on November 11, 2003, and later updated by him on July 6, 2004.

He deliberately failed to disclose his Chapter 7 bankruptcy,\na large delinquent debt, and his 1979 felony arrest on his security clearance application.  He failed\nto mitigate the criminal conduct, sexual behavior, and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance\nis denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On July 18, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct),\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant\nanswered the SOR in writing on July 27, 2006, and elected not to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge.  Applicant requested his case be decided on the written record.  The case was\nassigned to me on March 15, 2007. \nOn January 30, 2007, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s written case.  A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant.  He was given\nthe opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.\nApplicant filed a response to the FORM on February 28, 2007, within the 30 day time allowed.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all SOR allegations, except subparagraph 2.b.  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that evidence, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is 52 years old, married, and has two children.  He is a veteran who now is retired\nand works for a defense contractor. (Item 4, Response to FORM)\nApplicant was arrested on April 9, 1979, for grand larceny after trust and petty larceny.  He\nworked in a restaurant when it was discovered that $1,100 was missing from the office safe.\nApplicant had access, along with other employees, to the safe.  Applicant was represented by an\nattorney and upon his advice plead guilty to the petty larceny, a misdemeanor offense.  The felony\ncharge of grand larceny was dismissed for want of prosecution.  Convicted of the petty larceny\ncharge, Applicant paid a fine of $100, ordered to spend six months in jail, and ordered to serve 12\nmonths probation, but that probation was stricken by the court.  Applicant did not disclose these\narrests on his security clearance application (SCA) that was originally submitted on November 11,\n2003, and later updated by him on July 6, 2004. (Items 4, 7, 8)\nThe Government investigated Applicant at his foreign duty station in 1995 for allegedly\ncommitting indecent acts or taking liberties with a child after being accused by someone that he was\nattempting to take nude photographs of a fourteen-year-old girl.  The girl was a friend of Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter, and the daughter of another military member.  Applicant was not charged with any offense\nafter the investigation, and no further action was taken on this allegation. (Item 9, Answer,\nResponse)\n\n4\nIn 1999, Applicant was charged with two counts of indecent assault, one specification of\nassault, and one charge and specification of failure to obey a lawful general regulation, all charges\nunder the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  Applicant was accused of engaging in these\nacts with two other military members, one of whom was a trainee in his military training\norganization.  Applicant pled not guilty to all charges and specifications, but the Special Court-\nMartial convicted him of indecent acts with another person instead of one of the indecent assault\nspecifications, guilty of the second specification of indecent assault, not guilty of the assault charge\nand specification, and guilty of disobeying a lawful general regulation by attempting to develop a\npersonal relationship with a trainee in his organization.  Applicant was sentenced to six months\nconfinement, reduction from E-6 to E-4, and a reprimand.  Applicant is registered as a sex offender\nin his state of residence, as a result of this conviction. (Items 9-12, 14)\nApplicant deliberately did not list his arrest for grand larceny after trust in 1979 on his SCA\nin 2003.  Question 21 (Police Record-Felony Offenses) asked if Applicant ever been charged with\nor convicted of any felony offense.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to that question, claiming he was told by his\nattorney he was convicted of a misdemeanor.  Applicant did not disclose, however, he was charged\nwith a felony that was later dismissed for want of prosecution. (Items 4, Answer, Response)\nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy on January 21, 2004.  He was discharged in bankruptcy\non May 4, 2004.  Applicant deliberately did not list this bankruptcy on his SCA when he updated it\non August 6, 2004, in his answer to Question 33 (in the past seven years have you filed bankruptcy?),\ninstead answering \u201cno.\u201d  Applicant claims his bankruptcy is a matter of public record and he made\na mistake in not disclosing it. (Items 4, 13, Answer, Response)\nApplicant deliberately did not disclose any financial delinquencies over 90 days in duration\nin response to Question 39 (are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt?), when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to that question.  Applicant owed a bank $10,088 for a charged off bad debt from July\n2003.  Applicant claims he lost track of his financial delinquencies because of family health\nproblems and the large credit card balances he carried on those cards. (Items 4, 13, Answer,\nResponse)\nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations except that he is registered as a sex offender.\nApplicant denies his culpability in the theft, assault, indecent assault, and failure to obey a lawful\ngeneral regulation charges, citing instead bias by the courts, competency of counsel, and other\nreasons.  Applicant claims he thought he was convicted in the state court in 1979 and in the military\ncourt-martial in 1999 of misdemeanor offenses.  Applicant did not admit he was arrested in 1979 on\na felony charge or disclose it on his SCA, which is the only felony charge the SOR alleges.\nDeliberately failing to disclose information sought by the Government on the SCA is a violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 for knowingly and willfully making a false statement or representation to any\ndepartment or agency of the U.S. Government. Violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 is a felony offense\nunder federal law.  Applicant certified on the SCA that his answers were true, complete, and correct\nto the best of his knowledge, and are made in good faith. (Items 4, Answer and Response)\nPOLICIES\n\n5\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\n\n6\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. E2.A10.1.1\nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior: The Concern: Sexual behavior is a security concern if it\ninvolves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual\nto coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  Sexual orientation\nor preference may not be used as a basis for or a disqualifying factor in determining a person\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance. E2.A4.1.1\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct: The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nE2.A5.1.1\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established by substantial evidence each of the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant takes the position that he did not commit the offenses alleged in the SOR or in the state\nand military courts, and therefore, he should receive a security clearance.\nGuideline J: The Guideline J allegations in Paragraph 1 set forth two court convictions in\n1979 and 1999, one investigated accusation in 1995, and a felony failure to disclose requested\ninformation on his 2003 SCA and updated in 2004.  The evidence the Government presented\ndemonstrated Applicant\u2019s culpability and he cannot now deny the underlying facts and events in each\nof those convictions and allegations.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (Allegations of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person is formally charged. E2.A10.1.2.1), and DC 2 (A single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses. E.2.A10.1.2.2) apply.\nConsidering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) listed in Guideline J, no MC apply.  Applicant\nhas a pattern of misconduct, two of which involve sexual misbehavior.  He was convicted of four\noffenses, including the 1979 petty larceny, and the indecent assault and indecent acts, and failure to\nobey a lawful general regulation in 1999.  There is no rehabilitation presented.  He voluntarily\ncommitted the acts, and was not pressured into committing them.  They are not isolated events and\n\n7\nhis continued registration as a sex offender, a requirement resulting from his 1999 convictions,\nmakes the sex offense recent.\nGuideline D: Under Guideline D, Applicant has two sexual behavior incidents on his record\nwithin a four year period.  In 1995, the Government investigated accusations that he tried to\nphotograph a 14-year-old girl in the nude.  That investigation did not lead to any formal charges.\nYet in 1999, he was court-martialled for indecent assault and assault on two young women in the\nmilitary, and for failure to obey a lawful general regulation not to engage in any relationship with\na military trainee under his supervision.  Applicant is a registered sex offender in his current state\nof residence resulting from his 1999 convictions.  DC 1 (Sexual behavior of a criminal nature,\nwhether or not the individual has been prosecuted. E2.A4.1.2.1), DC 3 (Sexual behavior that causes\na person to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. E2.A4.1.2.3), and DC 4 (Sexual\nbehavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects a lack of discretion or judgment. E2.A4.1.2.4)\napply.  Applicant, being married, is vulnerable to coercion, etc., for his sexual misconduct with\nwomen not his wife.  His attempts to form a relationship with a military trainee under his\nsupervision, in direct contravention of a general regulation prohibiting that type of relationship,\nshows a gross lack of good judgment by a non-commissioned officer in the military.\nReviewing the MC under this Guideline, no MC apply to Applicant.  He is a registered sex\noffender, and the behavior is recent for the purposes of the Guideline D criteria.  These convictions\nrelate to two instances of questionable judgment regarding women under his supervision.  His\nbehavior could be a basis for coercion, duress, and exploitation because of his multiple acts of sexual\nmisconduct showing he cannot exercise good judgment in that area of interpersonal relationships.\nGuideline E: The deliberate failure to disclose requested information on the SCA is the last\nsecurity concern.  Applicant did not disclose the accurate information requested in Question 21 (his\nfelony arrest in 1979), Question 33 (his January 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition filing), and\nQuestion 39 (his financial delinquency over 90 days in duration pertaining to the $10,088 owed to\na bank) of the SCA.  DC 2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, or similar form used to determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness E2.A5.1.2.2), and DC 4 (Personal conduct that increases an\nindividual\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which,\nif known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing or render the person\nsusceptible to blackmail. E2.A5.1.2.4) apply.  In addition to his deliberate failure to disclose any\nunfavorable information, the nature of the sexual conduct increases his vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  Being a registered sex offender decreases his standing in the community.\nThere are no MC that apply here.  Applicant had two opportunities to supply the information\nabout his arrest on felony charges in 1979 on his SCA in 2003 and 2004, but failed to do so.  He also\nhad two opportunities to disclose his delinquent bank debt of $10,008 on the same SCA, but failed\nto do so.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy after he first completed his SCA in November 2003, but\nfailed to disclose it on his August 2004 update.  Applicant\u2019s claims this information is a matter of\npublic record begs the questions asked on the SCA.  Those questions ask for full disclosure from\nApplicant, not selective disclosures of information that the Government may find on other records\nif it checked every record depository in the country that might have some information on Applicant.\nApplicant\u2019s disclosures are designed to help the Government make an informed decision on his\napplication for a security clearance, and to allow the Government to compare disclosures to records.\n\n8\nIt is not a game of \u201ccatch my records if you can, and if you cannot, then I should get a security\nclearance.\u201d  Applicant certified his answers were complete and correct, and were made in good-faith.\nBut the evidence shows that certification was false.  His deliberate failure to disclose the requested\ninformation is a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001 and a felony offense.\nWhole Person Concept: The \u201cwhole person concept\u201d looks at the entirety of Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and history.  His misconduct is serious and of a repeated nature in the sexual behavior realm.\nIt was frequent, and he  was an adult of 45 in a supervisory capacity when he committed the indecent\nassaults.  He voluntarily committed all of the acts alleged in the SOR, yet now in his Response and\nAnswer attempts to avoid and deny his culpability even though he was convicted in two courts.\nThere is no rehabilitation or behavioral changes shown by Applicant, and he has the burden of proof\nand persuasion on that issue also.  His motivation for his sexual behavior was to gratify his lust, and\nhis motivation for falsifying his SCA was to cover up his past misconduct so he would obtain a\nsecurity clearance to keep his job.  Within this context he is vulnerable to coercion, as contemplated\nby the Guidelines.  Finally, absent recognition of his misconduct and sufficient rehabilitation, there\nis strong likelihood of recurrence, and the requirement that he register as a sex offender shows the\npublic\u2019s concern that he will repeat his past behavior.  In summary, there is nothing favorable about\nApplicant under the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d to support the issuance of a security clearance.\nTherefore, after considering all evidence, I conclude the Guideline J Criminal Conduct\nsecurity concern against Applicant.  I conclude the Guideline D Sexual Behavior security concern\nagainst Applicant.  I also conclude the Guideline E Personal Conduct security concern for his\nrepeated falsifications against Applicant.  Lastly, the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d is concluded against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3.  Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nPhilip S.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2007, Applicant admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old systems engineer. In December 1996, he completed his first bachelor\u2019s degree in creative writing. In May 2002, he completed his second bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. He completed a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering in December 2005 (Tr. 5). He has never been married, and has no children. In June 2002, Applicant began working for a defense contractor, and shortly thereafter, he was granted access to classified information at the secret level. He has held access to classified information since then (Tr. 6). In 2005, he submitted a security clearance application requesting an upgrade of his access to classified information to the top secret level. He has worked for his current employer for approximately one year (Tr. 32). There is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised classified information or that he has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of classified information. 3 The Government\u2019s security concerns in this case arose out of Applicant\u2019s 1994 conviction for reckless homicide and seven speeding tickets he has accumulated since then.

On August 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).2  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 17, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on November 13, 2007. \nOn November 14, 2007, Department Counsel telephonically contacted Applicant at his \nplace of work in Australia to propose hearing dates. On that day, Applicant requested \n \n1  Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing. \n \n2  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nhis hearing be conducted via video teleconference (VTC) and agreed to a hearing date \nof December 12, 2007 (Tr. 14-16). DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 12, \n2007. I convened the hearing at 4:00 P.M., on December 12, 2007, Eastern Standard \nTime (8:00 A.M. on December 13, 2007, Australia time). The government offered \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 19, which were received without objection.  \n \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted exhibits (AE) 1 and 2 post-\nhearing, which were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until January 10, 2008, to submit additional matters. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 4, 2008. The record closed on January 10, \n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nOn November 14, 2007, Applicant agreed to a hearing via VTC on December 12, \n2007. Because of the uncertainty concerning the availability of the VTC facility in \nAustralia, and confusion due to the time difference, the hearing notice was not issued \nuntil December 12, 2007. At the hearing, I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 \nof the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant stated he was ready to \nproceed, that he had sufficient time to prepare for his hearing, and affirmatively waived \nhis right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 14-16.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 17, 2007, Applicant admitted all \nSOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, including his demeanor and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old systems engineer. In December 1996, he completed \nhis first bachelor\u2019s degree in creative writing. In May 2002, he completed his second \nbachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering. He completed a master\u2019s degree in \nsystems engineering in December 2005 (Tr. 5). He has never been married, and has no \nchildren. \n \nIn June 2002, Applicant began working for a defense contractor, and shortly \nthereafter, he was granted access to classified information at the secret level. He has \nheld access to classified information since then (Tr. 6). In 2005, he submitted a security \nclearance application requesting an upgrade of his access to classified information to \nthe top secret level. He has worked for his current employer for approximately one year \n(Tr. 32). There is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised classified \ninformation or that he has failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the \nprotection of classified information. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe Government\u2019s security concerns in this case arose out of Applicant\u2019s 1994 \nconviction for reckless homicide and seven speeding tickets he has accumulated since \nthen. In November 1993, Applicant and his girlfriend were riding a motorcycle on his \ncollege campus. He was speeding, driving recklessly, and his brakes failed at a four-\nway stop. They were involved in a motorcycle accident and Applicant\u2019s girlfriend died as \na result of the accident. He was charged with Reckless Homicide, Involuntary \nManslaughter, and Criminal Recklessness Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury. The last \ntwo charges were dismissed by the prosecutor, apparently as a result of a pre-trial \nagreement. \n \nIn May 1994, Applicant was convicted of Reckless Homicide, a Class C felony in \nhis state (GE 7). On June 29, 1994, Applicant  was sentenced to \u201cthe county jail, with \nthe recommendation of work release, for a period of two years, with good time credit, to \nbe followed by two years of supervised probation on condition that he serve two years \nof home detention\u201d (GE 8).3 The Court gave Applicant a credit of one day for time spent \nin pre-trial confinement while the charges were pending (GE 8).   \n \nOn Wednesday, July 6, 1994, Applicant reported to the county jail and began \nserving his sentence in the Work Release Program (GE 8, Tr. 36). While on work \nrelease, Applicant was allowed to leave the county jail only to attend work and school. \nApplicant was required to sign in and out of the jail; he was subject to random searches, \ndrug testing, and his whereabouts in and out of jail were constantly monitored by jail \npersonnel to ensure his compliance with the terms of the program. When Applicant was \nnot attending authorized work or school, he was required to be in the county jail (Tr. 36-\n44). \n \nApplicant contended he was released from the Work Release Program on July 3, \n1995, that he was given two days credit for time spent in jail in pre-trial confinement, \nand that his home detention should not be considered confinement for purposes of AG \n\u00b6 31(f) (10 U.S.C. 986). Applicant believed he served less than 365 days in \nconfinement. \n \nThe Government contended Applicant served on work release from July 6, 1994 \nto at least August 18, 1995. In support of her position, Department Counsel relied \nprimarily on Applicant\u2019s Petition for Extension of Time in Which to Return to Work \nRelease Program (GE 11) and the Court Order granting the petition (GE 12), both of \nwhich show Applicant was required to return to the county jail on April 18, 1995, to \ncomplete the work release portion of his sentence.4 \n \n3  The Court considered as aggravating factors that Applicant had a prior conviction for \nconversion, was convicted in September 1993 for operating a motorcycle 40 m.p.h. in a 20 m.p.h. zone, \nand that he failed to stop and yield to a police officer and disregarded multiple traffic signs during the \nReckless Homicide offense (GE 8). \n \n4  Applicant\u2019s Petition for Modification of Sentence (GE 14) also indicates Applicant served at \nleast one year on work release. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nAfter careful consideration of all the evidence, I find Applicant was released from \nthe Work Release Program on July 3, 1995. The \u201cAdult Probation Data\u201d document \nenclosed in AE 1 shows Applicant was released from the Work Release Program on \nJuly 3, 1995. This finding is corroborated by the counselor\u2019s comments journal for July \n6, 1995, indicating: \u201cReleased from WR completing 362 days\u201d (enclosed in AE 1). \nAdditionally, two other documents support this finding: (1) a July 6, 1995, letter from the \nWork Release Director to the Court indicating Applicant had successfully completed 362 \ndays on the program as of July 3, 1995 (GE 10); and, (2) a Court order, apparently \nprepared by Applicant\u2019s attorney for the Court\u2019s approval/signature, and attached to \nApplicant\u2019s Petition for Permission to Travel (AE 2).5 Paragraph 1 of the Court Order \nstates: \u201cApplicant will complete the work release portion of his sentence . . . on July 3, \n1995.\u201d   \n \nTo summarize my findings, Applicant began serving his sentence in the Work \nRelease Program on Wednesday, July 6, 1994, and he was released on Monday, July \n3, 1995. Applicant was incarcerated for a total of 364 days \u2013 which include the 363 days \nserved on work release, plus one day of credit he received for time spent in pre-trial \nconfinement. \n \nApplicant began serving home detention on August 23, 1995. The Court released \nhim from home detention on April 25, 1996, but kept him on supervised probation (GE \n13, 14, 16). While on home detention, Applicant was confined to his home at all times, \nexcept when specifically authorized by the Court to attend activities such as work, \nschool, and religious services (GE 8). I find Applicant\u2019s home detention was not \ntantamount to incarceration because he was not institutionalized and the only condition \non his liberty was that he had to remain in his home. \n \nApplicant has been convicted for speeding seven times since his 1993 accident, \nto wit: July 1996, February 1997, August 1998, October 2000, September 2002, May \n2003, and July 2004. On the last three occasions his speed exceeded the speed limit by \nat least 10 miles per hour (GE 19). Applicant explained these last three violations \noccurred on highways with speed limits of 65 miles per hour, and that his speed did not \nexceed the limit by more than 10 miles per hour (Tr. 68).  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant expressed sincere remorse for his 1993 accident. He \nnoted he was young and immature (19 years old) at the time, but that there were no \ndrugs or alcohol involved. He disclosed his 1994 conviction on his 2002 and 2005 \nsecurity clearance applications. He has had access to classified information since 2002 \nwith no security violations or breach of trust. He averred that except for his speeding \ntickets, he has maintained a clean record since 1994. \n \n \n5  Applicant presented only the first page of the Court Order; however, other documents (GE 11 \nand 12) show the Court granted the petition to travel. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant testified he has had an impeccable record working for defense \ncontractors providing support to the military in high visibility projects. There is no \nevidence to dispute he is a valued employee with good work performance. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d7 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n \n6  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n7  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nApplicant was convicted in 1994 for reckless homicide, he was sentenced to jail \nfor a period of two years, albeit with a recommendation of work release, and he actually \nserved his incarceration on a work release program for a period of 364 days. While on \nwork release, he was subject to significant conditions on liberty equivalent to \nconfinement, i.e., he was not allowed to leave jail unless specifically authorized to do so \nto attend work or school, he remained in jail at night and during the weekends, and he \nwas subject to constant monitoring, in and out of jail, as well as unannounced searches \nand drug testing. His time on work release is considered imprisonment for purposes of \ncalculating the length of his incarceration.8  \n \n \nDisqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 31(a): \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses\u201d applies. DC \u00b6 31(f): \u201cconviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-\nmartial of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year,\u201d does not apply \nbecause Applicant was incarcerated for less than a year.  \n \n \nAG & 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31(a). After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), I \nfind that AG 32(a) and AG 32(d) partially apply \u2013 his criminal behavior is temporally \nremote and there is no evidence of additional criminal activity, he completed college and \nadvance education, and he has been employed since 2002 by defense contractors \n \n8  See U.S. v. Ruffin, 40 F.3d 1296 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (a sentence to imprisonment for one year with \nwork release, where appellant was imprisoned on weekends from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. daily, is a \nsentence of incarceration); and U.S. v. Timbrook, 290 F.3d 957 (7th Cir. 2002) (a sentence of work \nrelease in a county jail was a sentence of imprisonment for purposes of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \nwhere the appellant had been sentenced to probation with a condition work release with incarceration in \nthe country jail when he was not at work).  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nhaving access to classified information without evidence of any security violation. \nAdditionally, Applicant is now a mature 33-year-old man with substantial responsibilities \nat work. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s seven speeding violations since his 1993 fatal \ntraffic accident cast serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules and regulations. Furthermore, his speeding violations show \nApplicant has not learned from his mistakes, that his questionable behavior is likely to \nrecur, and such behavior cast doubts on his rehabilitation. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nUnder Guideline E, the security concern is that conduct involving questionable \njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified information. AG & 15.  \n \n \nSince the 1993 fatal traffic accident, Applicant has accumulated seven speeding \nviolations. His speeding, when considered in conjunction with the circumstances that \ncaused his 1993 accident (speeding and reckless driving), cast serious doubt about his \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. His \nbehavior triggers the applicability of AG \u00b6 16(d): \u201ccredible adverse information that is not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected \ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rules violations.\u201d \n \n \n \nAG & 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security \nconcerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and find it partially \napplies since the traffic violations are not serious offenses. However, his seven \nspeeding violations since his 1994 conviction forms a pattern of frequent behavior that \nis likely to recur, shows he has not learned from his past mistake, and casts doubts on \nhis reliability, good judgment, and ability to comply with laws, rules and regulations. AG \n\u00b6 17(d) is not applicable because Applicant has failed to change the behavior that \ncontributed to his 1994 conviction. His seven speeding violations show he has failed to \ntake positive steps to prevent recurrence of his past behavior. They also show \nApplicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to learn from his mistakes, and demonstrate his \npoor judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n8 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, well educated \nman. Since 1994, he has been successful as a student and at work. He has held access \nto classified information at the secret level for approximately 4 years. There is no \nevidence to show Applicant has ever compromised or caused others to compromise \nclassified information. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in his case, Applicant\u2019s 1994 \nconviction, coupled with his seven speeding violations create doubts as to his judgment, \nreliability, and ability to comply with laws, rules and regulations. I find Applicant\u2019s recent \nspeeding tickets undercut his claims of successful rehabilitation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 18, 2006. He admitted the allegations in Paragraph 2, denied\nthose in Paragraph 1, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on March 9, 2007 after having previously been assigned to\nanother administrative judge. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 30, 2007, scheduling it for\nApril 24, 2007. During the hearing, I received eight government exhibits,  the testimony of a\ngovernment witness, 14 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the\ntranscript on May 2, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old married man with a three-month-old child. He earned a bachelor\nof science degree in computer engineering in December 2002, and works as an information\ntechnology consultant.  According to one of his clients, he is highly reliable, effective, and\n1\ntrustworthy.  His supervisor is similarly impressed with his job performance.\n2\n3\nApplicant used marijuana approximately 20 to 25 times between high school and sophomore\nyears of college, from May 1998 to December 2000.  In the spring of 2000, he applied for a summer\n4\ninternship with a company that required him to obtain a secret clearance and eligibility for access\n\nExhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, executed May11, 2000.\n5\nId. at 7.\n6\nPersonnel Security Policy Advisory, signed by Applicant May 11, 2000, as included in Exhibit 3, at 5.\n7\nExhibit 4, Applicant\u2019s Appeal of federal agency\u2019s decision to deny him eligibility for access to SCI, undated,\n8\nat 1.\nSee Exhibit 4, supra.\n9\nSee note 3, supra.\n10\nAnswer, dated April 18, 2000 at 1.\n11\nExhibit 2, DoD Letter of Consent, with Clearance Date of December 15, 2000.\n12\n3\nto sensitive compartmented information (SCI.).  This was the first time he had ever applied for a\n5\nsecurity clearance.\nOn May 11, 2000, he completed the security clearance application, fully disclosing his past\nmarijuana use.  Upon being hired, he received a personnel security policy advisory memo explaining\n6\nthe criteria for maintaining a security clearance. He signed it, certifying that he understood the policy,\nand the consequences of failure to abide by it.7\nBefore beginning the internship, Applicant was required to pass a drug test. In anticipation\nof the drug screening process, he had stopped using marijuana for three months in advance.8\nSubsequently, he passed the drug test, but immediately resumed using marijuana after beginning the\ninternship. He used it for its entire duration.9\nShortly after beginning the internship, the National Security Agency (NSA) began\ninvestigating his eligibility for access to SCI. On August 11, 2000, an NSA investigative agent\ninterviewed him.  Applicant elaborated on his past marijuana use. Also, he expressed an intention\n10\nto continue using it if he did not get the SCI clearance.11\nDuring the time NSA was investigating Applicant for an SCI clearance, the Defense Security\nService (DSS) was concurrently investigating the issue of Applicant\u2019s secret clearance eligibility.\nApplicant was granted an interim secret clearance in December 2000, pending the completion of a\nbackground investigation.  At this time, the NSA\u2019s decision regarding Applicant\u2019s eligibility for\n12\naccess to SCI was still pending. Applicant was unaware that two DoD agencies were conducting\nseparate investigations.\nWhen DSS granted Applicant the interim secret clearance, he had completed the summer\ninternship, and was scheduled to return to the employer the following summer.

He did not return to work for his employer\n13\n14\nthat summer, as scheduled.15\nWhile the appeal was pending, on July 16, 2001, a DSS agent, as part of the investigation into\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a secret-level clearance, canvassed his neighborhood in search of\nneighbors to interview.  Applicant saw the investigator, and told him he had already been denied\n16\na clearance, and that any additional investigation was a waste of time.  Later, he faxed the agent the\n17\nNSA paperwork.18\nIn September 2001, the NSA issued a final decision denying Applicant\u2019s access to an SCI\nclearance.  In April 2002, another DSS agent interviewed Applicant. He told the agent he had never\n19\nbeen denied a clearance, and that he had never been briefed in regard to a security clearance and\nsafeguarding classified information.  The agent then confronted him with the NSA report.\n20\n21\nAccording to the agent, Applicant appeared confused.  He asked to terminate the interview until he\n22\ncould confirm whether NSA\u2019s denial of access to SCI  was indeed a denial of a clearance that he\nwould have to list on future security clearance questionnaires.  He never contacted NSA.\n23\n24\nFor the next year and half, Applicant was employed by a number of companies that did not\nrequire him to have a security clearance.  In December 2003, he was hired by a company that\n25\nrequired one.  He then completed a security clearance application on December 29, 2003.  He\n26\n27\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Question 32 (Your Investigation Record - Clearance Actions   To your\nknowledge have you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked,\n\nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\n28\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substances . . . or prescription drugs?\nTr. 70.\n29\nTr. 89.\n30\nTr. 89.\n31\nTr. 85.\n32\nTr. 86.\n33\nTr. 32.\n34\nQuestion 31 (Your Investigation Record - Investigations/Clearances Granted Has the United States\n35\nGovernment ever investigated your background and/or granted you a security clearance?

(Note: An administrative downgrade\nor termination of a security clearance is not a revocation). He disclosed the college drug use in\nresponse to Question 27.28\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he thought he did not need to list the denial of eligibility\nfor access to SCI because he was not sure whether it constituted a denial,  and had somehow\n29\n\u201cbetween [the NSA security office] and the security officer [of his employer]  . . .   become under\nthe impression\u201d  there was a probationary period in which young college students who were denied\n30\nclearances for using drugs in limited amounts could wait three years and reapply for a clearance\nwithout having to list the original denial.  Also, he testified that he met with the FSO of his new\n31\nemployer to confirm the accuracy of his impression.  She told him to enter \u201cno,\u201d and that the\n32\ninvestigator would flag his response if it created a problem.  \n33\nThe FSO testified that she did not recall  any conversation with Applicant about his security\nclearance application, and that in her 18 years at the company no employee had ever asked her about\nQuestion 32.34\nOn the December 2003 SF 86, Applicant was also required, among other things, to disclose\nwhether the government had ever conducted a background investigation into his security clearance\neligibility.  He did not disclose the NSA investigation.\n35\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthey are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that\nmay be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n36\n6\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline H: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding\nan individual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or\ndependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n36\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct\nWhen Applicant met with an investigative agent in April 2002, he failed to tell him, when\nasked, that he had been denied access to SCI in September 2001. This omission raises the issue of\nwhether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.3 (Deliberately providing\nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security\n\n7\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel\nsecurity or trustworthiness determination) applies.\nWhen Applicant completed the 2000 SF 86, he was 21 years old, and had never previously\napplied for a security clearance application. Also, he was unaware that the government initiated two\nseparate investigations after he completed the application. Moreover, agents continued to investigate\nhis eligibility for a secret-level clearance while his appeal of the NSA denial of SCI eligibility was\npending, and after NSA issued a final denial of SCI eligibility in September 2001. Under these\ncircumstances, his April 2002 statement to the agent that he had never been officially denied a\nclearance was based upon a reasonable, but mistaken  misunderstanding of the effect of the 2001\ndenial of access to SCI, and did not constitute a deliberate falsification.\nConversely, Applicant completed his most recent SF 86 approximately18 months after he\nspoke with the agent in 2002. This constituted ample time to resolve any lingering confusion about\nthe meaning of his denial of SCI access. Nevertheless, Applicant failed to list the denial of access\nto SCI in response to Question 32 of the SF 86.\nAlso, Applicant\u2019s contention that he believed he was under some sort of probationary period\nthat negated the requirement to list the 2001 denial of SCI access on the SF 86 was not credible. The\nNSA documents unequivocally indicate that he was investigated in the summer of 2000, issued an\ninitial denial in April 2001, and issued a final denial in September 2001 after an appeal. They do not\nreference a probationary period. Moreover, he never mentioned anything about a probationary period\nwhen he spoke with an agent in 2002.\nApplicant\u2019s assertion that someone from either NSA or his old employer told him of a\nprobationary period was uncorroborated. Moreover, his assertion that he spoke with the FSO about\nthis issue was contradicted by the FSO\u2019s testimony.\nApplicant falsified the SF 86 by failing to disclose the 2001 denial of SCI access in response\nto Question 32. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities), applies without mitigation.\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use triggers the application of Drug Involvement Disqualifying\nCondition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug abuse). The significance of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use\nis exacerbated by his continued use after gaining a job in May 2000 that required a security clearance\nand expressly prohibited illegal drug use.\nApplicant was a 21-year-old college student when he began working for the company that\nrequired the security clearance. He has not smoked marijuana since December 2000. In the years he\nhas been marijuana-free, he has graduated from college, held steady jobs, gotten married, and started\na family. Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (The drug involvement was\nnot recent), and DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future),\napply. He has mitigated the drug involvement security concern. For the same reasons, any concerns\n\n8\nhis past drug use posed with respect to his personal conduct, as cross-alleged in SOR subparagraph\n2.c, are also mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s youth and immaturity when he smoked marijuana, combined with the amount\nof time that has elapsed since he last used it, mitigates the drug involvement security concern. Also,\nthe severity of his failure to disclose his earlier denial of SCI on his SF 86, as required, is offset\nsomewhat by his disclosure of his marijuana use that triggered the denial. I am unable to conclude,\nhowever, that the security concern has been mitigated. Upon comparing Applicant\u2019s testimony with\nthe FSO\u2019s testimony, and reviewing the investigative agents\u2019 reports of their respective meetings\nwith Applicant, I conclude that he is a bright, talented individual who deliberately omitted\ninformation from the SF 86 that he did not want to disclose, and chose to concoct a clever, yet\nspecious explanation for the omission rather than telling the truth. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

HOGAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMichael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nJames B. Norman, Esq., Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlexander J. Brittin, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant's omission of use of hallucinogenic mushrooms on a 1999 security clearance\napplication and a 1999 signed, sworn, statement  raised questions about her judgment and credibility.\nConcerns have been mitigated based on her full voluntary disclosure of her drug use during her 2005\nperiodic reinvestigation. Applicant's recreational drug use in college and a one time marijuana use\nin October 2001 after being granted a security clearance are mitigated based on the passage of time\nand her expressed intentions not to use illegal drugs in the future. The Personal Conduct security\nconcern is mitigated. Clearance is granted.\n\n This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n Tr. at 66; Gov Ex 2.\n2\n Tr. at 68; Gov Ex 2, question 5.\n3\n Tr. at  66; Gov Ex 2, question 8.\n4\n Tr. at 59-61; AE A; Gov Ex 1, 2, 3.\n5\n Gov Ex 3 at 1-2.  \n6\n Tr. at 59.  \n7\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 13, 2006,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.\nIn a sworn statement signed May 16, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on July 20, 2006. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non August 9, 2006, scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2006. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. The SOR was amended by changing Applicant's name to \"********************\"\nrather than \"*********************\" The government submitted three exhibits that were marked\nas Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-3. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection.\nThe government called one witness, a Special Investigator for the Office of Personnel Management\n(OPM). Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted three exhibits which were marked as\nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A-C and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on September 18, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn her SOR response, Applicant denies all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and\ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 29-year-old regional director for a defense contractor. On November 22, 2004,\nshe submitted a security clearance application as part of a periodic reinvestigation.   She has a\n2\nbachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering and a master's degree in\ntelecommunications management.   She married in June 2004, and has no children.\n3\n4\nApplicant first tried marijuana a couple times while in high school. Her first use occurred in\nFall 1994.  She used marijuana approximately 17 times between Fall 1994 to March 1999.   She used\n5\nmarijuana socially, usually while at parties with friends.   She and her friends purchased marijuana\n6\na couple of times while in college for their own personal use.7\n\n AE A; AE C.\n8\n Tr. at 75,80, 90-91. \n9\n Tr. at 97-98; AE C at 2. \n10\n Tr. at 80-82, 90-91, 97-98; AE C at 2.\n11\n Tr. at 105.\n12\n Gov Ex 1.\n13\n Tr. at 46-47, 58, 74-75, 84; AE C.\n14\n3\nBetween the summer of 1995 and Fall 1997, Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms on\nfour occasions. Her first use occurred in summer 1995. She also used hallucinogenic mushrooms on\nJuly 4, 1996, at a Halloween party in 1996, and at a Halloween party in 1997.   \n8\nIn the summer of 1997, Applicant had her wisdom teeth pulled.  She was prescribed\nHydrocodone, a pain medication.  Sometime in the fall of 1997, her roommate acquired some\n9\nHydrocodone pills. Applicant and her roommate each took a Hydrocodone pill on two occasions.\nApplicant did not have a prescription for Hydrocodone when she took the drug on these occasions.10\nIn 1998, while on spring break, Applicant took a day trip to Mexico.  She purchased a small\namount of Hydrocodone tablets as a surprise for her roommate. You can purchase Hydrocodone\nwithout a prescription in Mexico.  She never ingested any of the Hydrocodone tablets.  Her\nroommate took one tablet.  Applicant flushed the rest of the Hydrocodone tablets down the toilet.11\nThe company Applicant currently works for is a family-owned business.  Her father is the\nPresident and CEO of the company.  In 1999, on the advice of their accountant, Applicant's parents\nstarting gifting interests in the company to their two children for estate tax purposes.  Applicant had\nto apply for a security clearance as part owner of the company.  She submitted a security clearance\n12\napplication on January 21, 1999.   Question 27 on the application reads:\n13\n  \nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs. Since the age\nof 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?  \nApplicant listed using marijuana between November 1994 and November 1997 on at least six\noccasions.  She did not list her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms or Hydrocodone. She testified at\nhearing that she did not list her hallucinogenic mushroom use because she forgot about it.  It did not\neven occur to her to list the Hydrocodone use. She did not think that she had to list it.  \n14\nOn April 8, 1999, Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security\nService in conjunction with her security clearance background investigation. On that same date, she\nprovided a signed, sworn statement. In the statement she stated that she used marijuana on at least\n\n Gov Ex 3.\n15\n Id. at 2.\n16\n Tr. at 68; Gov Ex 2, question 6; AE B. \n17\n Tr. at 96-97; Gov Ex 2, question 43. \n18\n Id. \n19\n Gov Ex 2.\n20\n Gov Ex 2, question 27. \n21\n Tr. at 46-47, 58-59, 74-75, 77.\n22\n4\n16 occasions between February 1994 to March 1999.  She also stated: \" I have never used any other\n15\nillegal drugs or abused legal substances.\"     \n16\nIn 1999, Applicant was granted a security clearance at the SECRET level.  In May 1999, she\ngraduated from college.  In June 1999, she accepted a job as a systems engineer with another defense\ncontractor. She was part of an engineering leadership development program. She worked there until\nAugust 2004. In August 2004, she assumed her current position.17\nIn October 2001, Applicant attended a dinner party hosted by a college friend.  After dinner,\na marijuana joint was passed around. When the marijuana joint was passed to her, she took one hit.\nRealizing that it was not the right thing to do, she stopped using marijuana and has not used\nmarijuana since that occasion.  She takes the responsibility of holding a security clearance seriously.\n18\nShe and her husband no longer socialize with people who use marijuana. She does not intend to use\nmarijuana in the future.19\nOn November 22, 2004, Applicant submitted a security clearance application in conjunction\nwith a periodic reinvestigation.   Question 27 on the application reads:\n20\nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs. Since the age\nof 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any\ncontrolled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants\n(barbituates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or\nprescription drugs?  \nApplicant answered, \"Yes\" to question 27 and listed marijuana use on nine occasions between April\n1997 and October 2001.  She did not list hallucinogenic mushroom use because her use of\n21\nhallucinogenic mushrooms was over seven years old.  Illegal drug use which occurred more than\nseven years prior to the date of completing the security clearance application is beyond the scope of\nquestion 27.  She did not list her Hydrocodone use because she did not think she needed to list it.22\nIt appears that her illegal use of Hydrocodone occurred more than seven years prior to Applicant's\nNovember 2004 security clearance application.   \n\n Gov Ex 2, question 43.\n23\n Id at question 29. \n24\n Tr. at 59, 64.\n25\n AE A; Tr. at 25, 33, 38, 62-63.\n26\n5\nApplicant answered \"yes\" to question 28 on her November 22, 2004, security clearance\napplication which reads:\nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive Positions.  Have\nyou EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law\nenforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security\nclearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting public safety?\nShe listed her October 2001 marijuana use in response to this question. She provided further details\nabout her October 2001 marijuana use in the general remarks section known on the security\nclearance application as question 43. She stated, in part: \n... I have no further intention of using marijuana. My last experience was over 3\nyears ago and it was while I had my security clearance.  I take that clearance very\nseriously. During that event, I took only one hit and quit because I realized it was not\nthe right thing to do. I have not smoked marijuana or been in any environment where\nanyone is smoking marijuana or utilizing any illegal substance since. I have no\nintention of engaging in activities I know could compromise my company, my family\nand my job as a contractor...23\nApplicant also answered \"yes\" to question 29 which reads:\nYour Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Drug Activity. In the last 7 years,\nhave you been involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, production,\ntransfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant,\nhallucinogen, or cannabis for your own intended profit or that of another?24\nShe did not provide further details about the \"yes\" response on her security clearance application.\nAt hearing, she explained that she answered \"yes\" pertaining to her purchase of marijuana for she\nand her friends' personal use while in college.   She did not make a profit off the marijuana purchase\n25\nand was not required to answer \"yes\" in response to question 29 based on the plain language of the\nquestion.    \n \nOn October 7, 2005, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) in conjunction with her second background investigation.  The OPM\ninvestigator went through each question on Applicant's security clearance application. When they\nreached the questions pertaining to illegal drug use, Applicant presented a list of all of her illegal\ndrug use.  The list was prepared in advance and included her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms.26\nAt some point during the interview, Applicant asked the OPM investigator whether she needed to\n\n AE C; Tr. at 34, 46, 78.\n27\n Tr. at 46.\n28\n Tr. at 104-116.\n29\n Tr. at 70; Answer to SOR.\n30\n Tr. at 71, AE B.\n31\n Id.\n32\n Department of the Navy v.

The OPM investigator thought Applicant was very forthcoming during the interview.\n27\n28\nApplicant's father testified on her behalf.  As mentioned previously, he is also her boss.\nApplicant has been a regional manager for two years. He describes her job performance as\nexceptional. He is not aware of any security incidents involving his daughter. He has a good\nrelationship with his daughter. He was disappointed when he learned of his daughter's drug use and\nbelieves it is inconsistent with her overall character. He describes her as being honest, trustworthy,\nand direct. He has no reservations about issuing her a security clearance.  \n29\nIn April 2006, Applicant successfully completed the Facility Security Officer (FSO) Program\nManagement Course at the Defense Security Service Academy. She has also completed the\nEssentials of Industrial Security Management course and Protecting Secret and Confidential\nDocuments course. She is certified as an FSO.   She is a member of the following organizations:\n30\nWomen in Defense; National Defense Industrial Association and the Air Force Communication\nElectronics Association.  In her spare time, she coaches a girl's soccer team for the local Parks and\n31\nRecreation department and attends church on a regular basis.32\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n33\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The\nadjudicative guideline at issue in this case is: \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.A5.1.1.\n34\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n35\n Id.\n36\n Id.\n37\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n38\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n39\n Directive, \u00b6 E.2.2.2.\n40\n7\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct:  Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.34\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   An administrative\n35\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available,\nreliable information about the person.  An administrative judge should consider the following\n36\nfactors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4)\nthe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n37\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\n38\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.   Any\n39\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.  \n40\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n\n Gov Ex 3 at 2. \n41\n8\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the\nfollowing conclusions.\nPersonal Conduct\nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 1.a (1), I find Applicant deliberately falsified her response to question\n27 on her January 21, 1999, security clearance application by deliberately omitting her use of\nhallucinogenic mushrooms.  She admits to using hallucinogenic mushrooms in the summer 1995,\nthe summer 1996, Halloween 1996, and Halloween 1997.  Her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms\noccurred within the parameters of the question.  Although, Applicant claims she forgot about her use\nof hallucinogenic mushrooms at the time she filled out her 1999 security clearance application, her\nlast use occurred less than two years prior to submitting her security clearance application. Applicant\nis an intelligent and well educated individual. I find it implausible that she forgot her use of\nhallucinogenic mushrooms when she filled out her security clearance application in 1999. \nI find for Applicant with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a(2) and 1.a(3).  In response to question 27,\nApplicant listed that she used marijuana six times. It was not an accurate accounting of the total\nnumber of times she used marijuana. However, I find that her inaccurate accounting of her marijuana\nuse was immaterial.  She put the government on notice that she illegally used marijuana.  When she\nwas interviewed in April 8, 1999, she provided further information about the number of times that\nshe used marijuana.  It did not occur to Applicant that she needed to list the Hydrocodone use on her\n1999 security clearance application.  I find her explanation credible. Her confusion about whether\nto list her Hydrocodone use was corroborated by the OPM Investigator during the hearing. During\nher 2005 interview with the OPM investigator, the OPM investigator testified that Applicant asked\nher during the interview whether she needed to list her Hyrdrocodone use in response to question 27.\nI conclude she did not deliberately omit her Hydrocodone usage.    \nApplicant deliberately falsified material facts in  her April 8, 1999, signed, sworn statement,\nby omitting her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms.  In her signed, sworn, statement, she states, \"I\nhave never used any other illegal drugs or abused legal substances.\"  This statement is not true\n41\nbecause she had experimented with  hallucinogenic mushrooms and Hydrocodone. Applicant's\nomission of her Hydrocodone use was not intentional based on her confusion over whether to list\nthe drug.  However, she had a duty to disclose her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms.  Applicant\nmaintains the sole focus of the interview was on her marijuana use.  However, her affirmative\nstatement that she used no other illegal drugs other than marijuana contradicts this assertion.  She\nalso testified that the Special Agent told her what to put in her signed, sworn statement.  Applicant\nwas a college student majoring in engineering at the time she filled out the security clearance\napplication.  She was able to understand the content of her signed, sworn statement. She had the\nopportunity to correct her statement.  In fact, several items are crossed out with Applicant's initials\nwritten next to the edits.  When she signed the document, she acknowledged that she read the entire\nstatement, that she initialed all pages and corrections, and that it is correct and true as written. I\n\nAE C.\n42\n9\nconclude that she was not truthful in her April 8, 1999, signed, sworn statement by deliberately\nfailing to list her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms.  \nThe government did not meet its burden of proof with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. SOR\n\u00b6 1.c alleged Applicant deliberately falsified her November 22, 2004, security clearance application\nby failing to list her use of hallucinogenic mushrooms and Hydrocone in response to question 27.\nI find the Applicant did not need to list the past uses since both occurred more than seven years prior\nto completing the application.  Her last use of hallucinogenic mushrooms occurred during Halloween\n1997.  Her use of Hydrocodone without a prescription occurred in the fall 1997. Although the OPM\nInvestigator's  investigative summary lists the Hydrocodone use occurred in the Fall 1998.42\nApplicant testified it occurred in the Fall 1997.  I find Applicant's testimony more reliable. The\nSpecial Agent's investigative summary is a summary of her notes of the interview.  The record is not\nclear when these notes were prepared.  As such, I do not find the summary to be as reliable as a\nsigned, sworn, statement taken at the time of the interview would have been. I conclude both uses\noccurred more than seven years prior to Applicant filling out her November 22, 2004, security\nclearance application. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant had purchased Hydrocodone in Mexico and transported it\nillegally over the border into the United States after she filled out her January 21, 1999, security\nclearance application.  Applicant acknowledges that she purchased Hydrocodone for her roommate\nwhile in Mexico.  She states that it was during Spring Break 1998 rather than Spring Break 1999.\nI find the conduct occurred in the Spring 1998 rather than 1999. The conduct occurred prior to\nApplicant completing her security clearance application.  Although the OPM Investigator's notes\nindicate the trip occurred during Spring Break 1999, I do not find the notes to be reliable for the\nreasons discussed in the previous paragraph.\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is the same allegation as SOR \u00b6 1.e, without the allegation that Applicant\ncommitted the act after she submitted a security clearance application in 1999.  Although Applicant\nadmits to purchasing Hydrocodone in Mexico and bringing it back into the United States, there is\nnothing in the record evidence that indicates her conduct was illegal.  Her conduct raises questions\nabout her judgment but  the Government submitted no information to support that her conduct was\nillegal as alleged in SOR. Applicant's admission of marijuana use on one occasion in October 2001,\nafter being granted a security clearance raises a an additional concern about her judgment.    \n     \nUnder Personal Conduct the following disqualifying conditions apply in Applicant's case.\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: (The deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies with respect to Applicant's deliberate\nomission of her hallucinogenic mushroom use in response to question 27 on her January 21, 1999,\nsecurity clearance application. \nPC DC E2.A5.1.2.3: (Deliberately providing false or misleading information, concerning\nrelevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or\n\n10\nother official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination) applies with respect to Applicant's April 8, 1999, signed, sworn statement.  The\nstatement was provided to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service in conjunction with a\nsecurity clearance background investigation.  Applicant stated that she had not used illegal drugs\nother than marijuana in this signed, sworn statement.  The statement was not true in that she used\nhallucinogenic mushrooms.  \n \nThe overall concern under Personal Conduct is also relevant to Applicant's case.  Conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations could indicate that a person may not properly safeguard\nclassified information.  Applicant's past drug involvement raises concerns about her judgment and\nreliability.  Of particular concern is her decision to use marijuana after being granted a security\nclearance in October 2001.\nThe Personal Conduct concern can be mitigated. I find Personal Conduct Mitigating\nCondition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.1 (The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a\ndetermination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability) applies.  Applicant's past conduct is no\nlonger pertinent to determine her judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  Most of Applicant's drug\nuse occurred when she was still a college student.  Since that time, she has matured and has accepted\nmore responsibility, both personally and professionally. Although, she withheld information about\nher illegal use of hallucinogenic mushrooms during her previous security clearance investigation,\nshe fully disclosed this information during her second background investigation. While she did not\ndemonstrate the best judgment by taking a hit from a marijuana joint after being granted a security\nclearance, she immediately understood the error of her actions and stopped.  She fully disclosed the\nincident on her 2004 security clearance application.  She has not used illegal drugs since October\n2001 and does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future.  \nPC MC E2.A5.1.3.2 (The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the\nindividual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily) is the only mitigating\ncondition that has the potential to apply to Applicant's falsifications during her previous security\nclearance investigation. Although Applicant withheld information about her hallucinogenic\nmushroom use during her 1999 background investigation, she fully disclosed this use during her\nperiodic reinvestigation. It has been more than six years since the falsifications occurred.  As such\nthe behavior is not recent. To her credit, Applicant provided the correct information voluntarily\nduring her October 2005 interview with an OPM investigator.  She prepared a list of the full extent\nof her drug use in advance of the interview. The OPM investigator testified that Applicant was very\nforthcoming during the interview.  More problematic is the question as to whether Applicant's\nfalsification was an isolated incident.  I cannot conclude the falsification was an isolated incident\nbecause Applicant deliberately omitted her hallucinogenic mushroom use on two occasions -on her\nsecurity clearance application in January 21, 1999, and in her April 8, 1999, signed sworn statement.\nFor this reason, PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2 cannot be applied.\nAlthough Applicant technically does not meet all three requirements of  PC  MC E2.A5.1.3.2,\nI conclude that her voluntary disclosure of her hallucinogenic mushroom use during her periodic\nreinvestigation negates the concern with respect to her prior falsifications.\nWhole Person Factors\n\n Directive, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.3, E2.2.1.4\n43\n Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n44\n Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1.6 and E2.2.1.9.\n45\n11\nThere are several whole person factors that apply in Applicant's favor. As to the nature,\nextent and seriousness of the conduct, Applicant's actions as a senior in college and young adult did\nnot demonstrate the best judgment. However, most of the conduct occurred over seven years ago.\nThe questionable conduct is not recent.  Applicant has since matured.  She is now married and is\n43\nadvancing in her professional career. She is involved in her community as well as in several\nprofessional organizations. \nApplicant's voluntary disclosure of  her past illegal drug use during her current security\nclearance background investigation are the actions of a person who has grown to appreciate the\nsecurity significance of providing full disclosure.  As a result of her full disclosure, she is not\nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress.  There is nothing in the record which would indicate\n44\nthat the Government had learned of her past drug use from third party sources. Applicant understands\nthe responsibilities entrusted to her with regard to protecting classified information based on her\ntraining to become an FSO.  Applicant's actions during her current security clearance investigation\nindicate that it is unlikely, she will repeat the behavior which raised the security concerns.  Based\n45\non these reasons, I conclude she has mitigated the concern under Personal Conduct.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I find Applicant\nmitigated the security concerns raised by the personal conduct concern. Therefore, I am persuaded\nby the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant a security clearance. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n12\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He has not surrendered his foreign\npassport or renounced his foreign citizenship.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 12, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 31, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on August 6, 2007, scheduling the hearing for September 12, 2007.\nAt the hearing the Government presented three exhibits.  The Applicant presented no exhibits but\ntestified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until September 25, 2007 to allow the\nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-\nHearing Exhibit consisting of 5 pages.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on September 20,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and\nthe testimony.  The Applicant is 61 years of age, married and holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics.  He is\nemployed as a Senior Software Engineer or Architect for a defense contractor.  He seeks a security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for\nanother country over the United States.\nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Switzerland and the United States.  He was born in Rome,\nItaly in 1946.  When he was ten years old, his family moved to Switzerland.  At the age of eighteen\nhe had to choose to either to keep his Italian citizenship or his Swiss citizenship.  Since his family\nwas in Switzerland and had decided to stay in Switzerland, the Applicant chose to become a Swiss\ncitizen. He attended his lower grade education in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland, and his\nhigher education was in the German-speaking part of Switzerland.  He attended the Swiss Federal\nInstitute of Technology.  He lived in Switzerland from 1956 until 1981, when he moved to the\nUnited States.  The Applicant decided to come to the United States mostly for his career in Computer\nScience, focusing on the architecture and development of Computer software.  In 1988, he and his\nwife, who is also a dual citizen of Switzerland and the United States, became naturalized United\nStates citizens.  \nThe Applicant presently possesses a passport from Switzerland, issued in October 2005, that\nwill not expire until 2015.  He continues to use his foreign passport to travel to Switzerland, Italy,\nTaiwan, Indonesia and other countries in Europe.  He most recently used it to travel to Indonesia in\nJanuary 2007.  The Applicant is not willing to renounce his citizenship with Switzerland and he does\nnot intend to give up his foreign passport.  The Applicant uses the Swiss passport as a matter of\nconvenience when he is traveling through out the European Union.        \n\n3\nThe Applicant served in the military service in Switzerland from 1969 through 1981.  He\nexplained that it was not his choice but mandatory by the Swiss government.  He testified that he is\na perfect, good standing citizen of Switzerland.  The Swiss government renewed his passport because\nof it.  He explained that Switzerland does not renew your passport if you for any reason have a\nproblem with their government.  For example, if you have not paid your taxes.  The Applicant stated,\n\u201cI am perfectly free to go back to Switzerland whenever I want.  I did not leave because I hated the\ncountry.  What happened is that my wife and myself in \u201881, we decided to come for five years in the\nUnited States to see - - mostly was over my career.  At the time, I came to teach at the University of\nMinnesota computer science and so on.  Then we started to like the lifestyle of the United States, and\nthat\u2019s why we finally decided to stay.  We become citizen, and we are still here.\u201d  (Tr. pp 21-22). \n \nThe Applicant does not remember taking an oath of allegiance when he became a United\nStates citizen.  (Tr. p. 27).  \nThe Applicant worked for a few years in Switzerland before coming the United States and\nis entitled to a minimal amount of social security from Switzerland.  As a Swiss citizen in good\nstanding he can at any time go back and work and also vote if he chooses to.  The Applicant has a\nbanking account in Switzerland with a few thousand dollars in it.  He also has a banking account in\nIndonesia and one in Italy.  He stated that he and his wife like to go on vacation to Indonesia and its\nsimple to have an account there to transfer money to rather than travel with a traveler check.  The\nApplicant also owns property in Italy that he inherited from his father.  He is presently is trying to\ndonate the property to a church.  (Tr. pp. 29-31).\nThe Applicant states that he is not a security concern and that he is honest and trustworthy.\nIn his Post-Hearing Exhibit the Applicant states that -\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Preference\n\n4\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n \n10(a) exercise fo any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\n10 (a)1 possession of a current foreign passport;\n10 (a)5 using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country;\n10(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\n\n5\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference) that\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant\ncan be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and\nhaving assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative Judge concludes\nthat the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's\nforeign contacts have a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified\ninformation.  \nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Switzerland and the United States who possesses a Swiss\npassport.  He uses his Swiss passport to travel to Switzerland and other countries in Europe and Asia.\nHe maintains a Swiss, Indonesian and Italian banking account and he owns property in Italy.  He\nenjoys traveling to countries in Europe and Asia without difficulty by using his Swiss passport.  He\nhas chosen not to surrender his foreign passport to the Swiss authorities and/or  relinquished his\nforeign citizenship.  Under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Conditions,10(a) exercise\nof any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through\nthe foreign citizenship of a family member, 10(a)1 possession of a current foreign passport, 10 a(5)\n\n6\nusing foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country, and 10(d) any\nstatement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the United States applies.  None\nof the mitigating conditions apply.  Accordingly, he has not clearly demonstrated an unequivocal\npreference for the United States.  Under the circumstances of this case, I find against the Applicant\nunder Guideline C. \nIn addition to the Disqualifying and Mitigating Conditions, I have also considered the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept.  The Applicant moved to the United States in 1981, with the original intent to stay\nfor only five years.  He decided to stay longer for career purposes.  He plans to return to Switzerland\nin the future, where he is eligible to work, vote and collect social security.  He obviously has some\nloyalty to the Swiss government.  The Applicant also served in the Swiss military service.  He has\nnot surrendered his foreign passport and relinquished his foreign citizenship.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline C of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly,\nhe has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    \nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant \n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On May 18, 2006,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 29, 2006, after the hearing,\n\nDecision at 4 & 6.\n1\nId at 6.\n2\n2\nAdministrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of two public trust position questionnaires was deliberate; whether the \nJudge erred by concluding that the trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline E had not been\nmitigated.\n(1) Applicant contends that she did not deliberately falsify two public trust positions\nquestionnaires by failing to disclose her debts that were delinquent for over 180 days.  In support of\nthis contention, she argues that the omission of the information was due to a misunderstanding on\nher part, and she subsequently provided the correct information.  Applicant has not demonstrated that\nthe Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why she failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  Given the record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\nThe trustworthiness concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsifications were not necessarily overcome by\nApplicant\u2019s subsequent disclosures to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd.\nJan. 22, 2004).  \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the trustworthiness concerns\nraised under Guideline E had not been mitigated, in that he did not apply a whole person analysis,\nand gave insufficient weight to the favorable evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s work ethic, work\nhistory and credible character.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge erred.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nhe specifically states otherwise. See, e.g., DOHA Case No. 96-0228 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 1997).\nThe Judge is not required to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g., DISCR Case\nNo. 90-1596 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 1992).  A review of the record indicates that the Judge\u2019s whole\nperson analysis complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1, in that the Judge considered\nthe totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in reaching his decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-23829 at\n4 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007).  The Judge specifically discussed the evidence to which Applicant refers\nin both his findings of fact and his conclusions.   He ultimately concluded that the evidence was\n1\ninsufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns stating: \u201cApplicant\u2019s character\nstatements and job performance evaluations constitute strong evidence weighing in her favor, but\nit falls short of overcoming Applicant\u2019s pattern of dishonest conduct.\u201d2\n\n3\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  He found in favor of Applicant under Guideline F.  However, the Judge\nreasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was\ninsufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.  The Board does not review\na case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate\nthe Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041\nat 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).

CURRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nGina L. Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s 2000 felony drug charge, 2002 dismissal from a job for surfing pornography on\na work computer, 2003 job dismissal for failing a drug test, and his failure to be fully forthcoming\nabout this history on his security clearance application generate a security concern. He provided\ncontradictory, implausible explanations for this conduct throughout the investigative process, and\nhas failed to mitigate the security concern. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended.\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 18, 2006, and requested an administrative determination.\nWithin 20 days of receiving the answer, the government requested a hearing. The case was converted\nto a hearing, then assigned to me on May 14, 2007, after originally being assigned to another\nadministrative judge. DOHA scheduled a notice of hearing on May 31, 2007, scheduling it for June\n21, 2007. \nDuring the hearing, I received five government exhibits, the testimony of a government\nwitness, 20 Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on July\n27, 2007.\nRULING OF EVIDENCE\nAt the hearing, the government objected to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, a drug test report, dated\nJune 16, 2003. I sustained the objection. After the hearing, as I reviewed the record, I discovered that\nExhibit C is part of a personnel file that is referenced in Exhibit B. Consequently, I have\nreconsidered my earlier decision sua sponte, and have admitted Exhibit C into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted SOR subparagraph 1.b and denied the remainder. It is incorporated into\nthe findings of fact. Also, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old single man who is a U.S. Army veteran, serving from 1975 to 1978\nwhen he was honorably discharged. He earned a bachelor of science degree in engineering in 1986,\nand currently works as a communications systems engineer. His responsibilities include building\nradio and satellite links.\nApplicant is highly respected at work. A supervisor considers him an expert in his field, and\ncharacterizes him as a man with exceptional \u201cstrength of character [and an] outstanding work ethic\n\nExhibit N.\n1\n Exhibit O.\n2\nTr. 26 - Testimony of Applicant\u2019s Third-Level Supervisor.\n3\nTr. 30 - Testimony of Applicant\u2019s Third-Level Supervisor.\n4\nTr. 97.\n5\nExhibit C.\n6\nExhibit 2, Employer\u2019s Adverse Information Report, dated January 27, 2003.\n7\n3\n. . . \u201d  Another supervisor describes him as diligent and industrious, \u201c. . . .always willing to go the\n1\nextra mile to provide our warfighters what they need, when they need it.\u201d2\nIn February 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony possession of cocaine.\nApproximately eight months later, he pleaded no contest, and he was placed on 18 months probation.\nIn October 2002, Applicant\u2019s employer, while in the process of conducting routine\nmaintenance of his computer, discovered pornography. The technology support staff support person\nprinted the images, and gave them to Applicant\u2019s third-level supervisor who confronted Applicant\nwith them.  Applicant admitted to downloading them onto his hard drive, and he was fired.  \n3\n4\nAt the hearing, Applicant denied downloading the pornography onto his work computer. He\nasserted that he traveled frequently, leaving the computer on in his absence, and that anyone could\nhave downloaded the material.5\nApplicant was unemployed for the next two months. In January 2003, he obtained another\njob. On January 16, 2003, he took a drug test. The government alleges in subparagraph 1.c that he\nfailed, testing positive for cocaine. Applicant denied he failed the drug test. He submitted an excerpt\nfrom his personnel file that appears to be a drug test result. It indicates he tested negative for illegal\ndrugs.  It is unsigned. Exhibit 2 is a document from his employer indicating he failed a drug test. It\n6\nis signed by a physician. I find that he failed the January 2003 drug test. He was terminated on\nJanuary 23, 2003, two days after the drug test results became available.  \n7\nOn February 26, 2004, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86). He\nanswered \u201cno\u201din response to Question 27 (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Since the\nage of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled\nsubstance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine,\ncodeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.)\nhallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?). He denied using cocaine on or about the\ndate he failed the drug test, as alleged in subparagraph 1.a.\nIn response to Question 20 (Your Employment Record - Has any of the following happened\nto you in the last 7 years? - Fired from job - Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired - Left a job\n\nAnswer at 7.\n8\nTr. 25.\n9\nTr. 116.\n10\nTr. 70.\n11\n4\nby mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct - Left a job for other reason under\nunfavorable circumstances), Applicant omitted his January 2003 termination. In his Answer, he\nasserted that the company that administered the drug test never officially hired him, and that he had\n\u201cnever received any monies, termination notice or W-2 form\u201d  after leaving. At the hearing, he\n8\ninitially testified that his employer did not fire him, and that they instead put him on extended leave.9\nLater during the hearing, he stated that he was employed there, but \u201ccompletely forgot\u201d  about the\n10\ntermination when completing the SF-86.\nApplicant met with a DoD investigator in March 2005. He did not disclose the 2003 failed\ndrug test.11\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding\nwhether to deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information\n(disqualifying conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an\nindividual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline H -  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an\nindividual\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or\ndependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could\nindicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n12\nTr. 143.\n13\nTr. 142.\n14\n5\nGuideline J - A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n12\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant\u2019s 2000 arrest and charge for felony cocaine possession triggers the application of\nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.2 (illegal drug possession). Despite\npleading no contest to the charge, he denied the cocaine was his at the ISCR hearing. He testified that\nthe charge occurred after he discovered that someone had stolen one of his personal checks, and\nattempted to make a purchase with it. Suspecting that it was a woman whom he had been dating for\napproximately a month, he contacted a mutual friend and sought her assistance in finding the\ngirlfriend. While Applicant was in the car with the mutual friend, the police stopped him for rolling\nthrough a stop sign.  Then, the friend, who was sitting in the passenger seat, threw a crack cocaine\n13\npipe on the floor.  When the police approached the car, they observed the pipe, and arrested him.\n14\nThis explanation is not credible.\nThe 2003 drug test failure is sufficient evidence to establish that he was using cocaine at or\nabout the date of the test. DI DC E2.A8.1.2.1 (Any drug abuse), applies. \nApplicant\u2019s last episode of drug involvement was more than four years ago. The remote\nnature of this conduct, however, is outweighed by the lack of credibility displayed when describing\nthe circumstances of the 2000 charge. Consequently, although DI MC E2.A8.1.3.1 (The drug\ninvolvement was not recent), applies, I conclude that his drug involvement remains a security\nconcern.\n\n6\nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s 2004 SF-86 omissions trigger the issue of whether Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities), applies. Applicant\u2019s farfetched explanation for his 2000 arrest, and his\ncontradictory explanations for his SF 86 omissions undermined his credibility. I conclude he falsified\nSF 86 Questions 20 and 27.\nApplicant had an opportunity to correct these falsifications when he met with an agent in\n2005. He failed to do so. PC DC E2.A5.1.2 applies without mitigation.\nApplicant\u2019s former third-level supervisor testified that he fired him in October 2002 for\nsurfing pornography on his work computer. Less than three months later, Applicant was fired from\nanother job after failing a drug test. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.1 (Reliable, unfavorable information provided\nby associates, employer, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances), and E2.A5.1.2.5 (A\npattern of dishonesty or rule violations  . . .  ), apply. Applicant denied the circumstances of both\nterminations. He asserted that the 2002 termination occurred because his former supervisor had a\nvendetta against him related to a professional disagreement, and he challenged the accuracy of the\ndrug test.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility displayed throughout the investigative process, his\nexplanation for the 2002 termination has limited probative value. Also, the disputed drug test result\nwas signed and dated by a physician. Both PC DC E2.A5.1.2.1 and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 apply\nwithout mitigation.\nCriminal Conduct\nThis guideline applies without mitigation for the same reasons as set forth in the Personal\nConduct section, above.\nWhole-Person Concept\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement was infrequent and remote. In conjunction with the on-the-job\nmisconduct in 2002, and his lack of credibility displayed throughout the investigative process,\nhowever, it remains a concern. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole-person concept, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and personal conduct remain significant security\nconcerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nOn February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline E, Personal Conduct and Guideline M, Use of Information Technology \nSystems. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 13, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on May 6, 2008. DOHA issued \nJuly 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \na notice of hearing on May 12, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on \nJune 17, 2008. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 24, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary Rulings \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. GE 1, 2, and 4 through 8 \nwere received without objection. Applicant originally objected to GE 3, a report of \ninvestigation (ROI) of an interview. The objection was sustained. Applicant later \nwithdrew his objection and GE 3 was admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nand offered Exhibits (AE) A through J, which were received without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been with \nhis current employer since 2002. He obtained a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. He is \nmarried with two children, ages 12 and 10.1  \n \n \nApplicant was a systems administrator for a company (company A) from about \n1998 to 2000. Part of his responsibilities included monitoring the employees\u2019 e-mail \ntraffic for viruses and unauthorized or illegal usage. Employees were informed that their \ne-mails were subject to monitoring. Applicant periodically read more of the e-mails than \nwas necessary to accomplish his job of monitoring the system.2  \n \n \nApplicant worked for another company (company B) from about 2000 to 2002. \nHe was in charge of the Information Technology (IT) department of the company. \nApplicant was again responsible for monitoring the company\u2019s e-mail and internet traffic. \nApplicant again read more of the employees\u2019 e-mails than his job required. While \nworking at companies A and B, Applicant installed company software on his home \ncomputer without the proper authorization.3  \n \n \nApplicant started working for his current employer (company C) in 2002. He does \nnot have the same responsibilities of monitoring the company\u2019s e-mail and internet \ntraffic that he held at the previous companies. On at least one occasion, he accessed \nand read his supervisor\u2019s e-mail without permission or authorization. Applicant testified \nthat he has since told the supervisor what he did and the supervisor was \u201ccomfortable \nwith it.\u201d Applicant introduced a character letter from this supervisor. The incident is not \nmentioned in the letter. Applicant has never been reprimanded or otherwise disciplined \nfor any of his actions at the three companies.4  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 58-59, 63-64; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 33-35, 56-57, 68-79; GE 1, 3. \n \n3 Tr. at 35-38, 40-44, 79-81, 81-87; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n4 Tr. at 38-40, 62, 70, 81-82, 114-115; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE C. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant provided differing accounts of the above events. He provided a written \nstatement to a background investigator on May 7, 2003. He discussed his employment \nat company A: \n \nAt no such time at [company A] or since then have I illegally accessed \ndata or not complied with computer or company security policies. I have \nnot used any information that may have been available to me in the \ncourse of my position and network security rights for any personal gain, or \nmalicious intent.5 \n \nApplicant denied that he intentionally misled the investigator by failing to discuss the \nincidents with his employers. He testified that he does not feel he ever illegally \naccessed data or e-mail as his job required him to monitor the e-mails.6  \n \n \nApplicant also discussed his marijuana use in the 2003 statement. He admitted \nto using marijuana on three occasions in 2001 and 2002. He wrote that his use in 2001 \nwas the first time he used marijuana. He also wrote that he had \u201cnot used any other \ndrugs.\u201d In a later statement, he admitted that he used marijuana and other illegal drugs \nas early as 1991.7  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed on October 14, 2004, in conjunction with a polygraph, \nfor a determination by another government agency of Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). A written statement was not taken, but the \ninterviewer summarized the interview in a report of investigation (ROI).8 There was no \nevidence introduced about how and when the report was prepared. Applicant admitted \nthat he misused his responsibilities at company A and crossed the line out of curiosity \nonce or twice a day for a month or two near the end of his term of employment. He \nadmitted to looking at his supervisor\u2019s e-mail to see what she thought of him. He also \nadmitted to looking for general office gossip. The report further noted: \n \nWhen confronted with the above information from the background \ninvestigator, SUBJECT stated HE was not honest. HE was surprised when \nconfronted with the information. HE did not tell them because HE was \nembarrassed and surprised.9 \n \n                                                          \n5 GE 7. \n \n6 Tr. at 44-48; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n7 GE 7, 8. Applicant\u2019s drug use was not alleged in the SOR and is not considered for disqualifying \npurposes. It was also not alleged that he falsified the 2003 statement regarding his drug use, and that is \nalso not considered for disqualifying purposes. The entire statement is considered when gauging \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole person analysis.  \n \n8 Tr. at 40; GE 3. The results of the polygraph were not offered into evidence. The polygraph is \nonly considered for the impact, if any, it had on Applicant\u2019s statement.  \n \n9 GE 7. Emphasis in original. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant testified that he was discussing the 2003 statement when he made the above \ncomments to the investigator.10   \n \n \nApplicant admitted during the October 14, 2004 interview that while with \ncompany B, he looked at his supervisor\u2019s e-mail and other employees\u2019 e-mail \napproximately 50 times over two years. He admitted that he read the e-mail of his \nsupervisor at his current employer about five times since he started in 2002. He stated \nhe did it to see what was going on and to keep him up-to-date as his supervisor did not \ncheck his e-mail everyday. He admitted that he installed company software on his home \ncomputer both with and without permission. He estimated that he installed about ten \napplications without permission. He also admitted driving while intoxicated \napproximately once per year over the previous five years.11 Applicant was denied \naccess to SCI by the other government agency in 2004.12  \n \n \nApplicant provided a written statement to a background investigator on August 9, \n2007. The investigator had either a copy of the 2004 ROI or the denial of Applicant\u2019s \nSCI, which summarized the ROI, or both, prior to the interview and written statement. \nRegarding his actions at company A, he wrote his \u201cposition at this work was to review e-\nmails that went through the company\u2019s system. I believe I went over the line of \nreviewing e-mail or reading more of the specifics of e-mails than I was required to do.\u201d \nHe discussed his actions at company B, and wrote the company \u201cdid not know that I \nwas doing this action at their facility, however, I believed at the time that this was my \nresponsibility for working at this facility. I did not believe I broke any policy for my job \ntitle nor responsibilities.\u201d Further in the statement he wrote that his \u201cviolation was \nreading more e-mail than [he] was requested to do.\u201d It is not perfectly clear which \ncompany this statement referred to, but immediately before the sentence he discusses \nthe time period of \u201c2000 to 2002,\u201d which coincided with his employment at company B. \nHe also admitted to misusing network security privileges at his current company \nbetween September 2002 and approximately March 2003.13  \n \n \nApplicant also wrote in the August 2007 statement: \u201cI admit to driving while \nintoxicated one time over the last five years.\u201d14 I do not find this statement to be \ninconsistent with Applicant\u2019s prior admission in October 2004, that he drove while \nintoxicated approximately once per year over the previous five years.  \n \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 87-89. \n \n11 GE 3, 7. Applicant\u2019s driving while intoxicated was not alleged in the SOR and is not considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It is considered solely for the purpose of deciding whether he provided false \ninformation about his drinking and driving in a subsequent statement.  \n \n12 GE 2, 4-6. \n \n13 Tr. at 90; GE 8. \n \n14 GE 8. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR dated March 13, 2008, he denied the \nallegations in the SOR that reflected his unauthorized access of e-mails at companies A \nand B. Regarding company A, he wrote \u201c[a]t no time did I access another person\u2019s e-\nmail without permission. I received permission from my supervisor when she asked me \nto be in charge of the network and security for [company A].\u201d He provided a similar \ndenial regarding company B, stating his actions were pursuant to his responsibilities. \nThese statements may be technically true. However, they are incomplete and \nmisleading. He admitted to SOR \u00b6 1.c, which alleged the access of his supervisor\u2019s e-\nmail at his current employer without permission. He stated it was a one-time incident \nthat occurred more than five years previous and has not been repeated since then. This \nis inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s previous admissions that he read his current supervisor\u2019s \ne-mails on about five occasions. \n \n \nApplicant testified he was authorized to install the applications on his home \ncomputer, as the companies had sufficient licenses from the software companies and \nhe was the one who decided who could have the software placed on their home \ncomputers. He initially admitted during testimony that he looked through his current \nsupervisor\u2019s e-mail a \u201chandful\u201d of times, which he thought was \u201cless than five.\u201d He later \ntestified that he only looked at his supervisor\u2019s e-mail without authorization on one \noccasion, but that he accessed his computer about three or four times.15 \n \n \nCharacter letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf describe him as loyal to the United States, \nprofessional, honest, ethical, truthful, dedicated, efficient, competent, responsible, and \nreliable. His performance appraisals are excellent.16  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n15 Tr. at 81-87, 114-115. \n \n16 AE C-J. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nSystems is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer \nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication, \ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of \ninformation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or \ncomponent thereof;  \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations. \n \nApplicant was in charge of monitoring the e-mail and internet for viruses and \nunauthorized use at his first two companies. Viewing employees\u2019 e-mail was part of his \njob. Once he verified that there was nothing of concern with the e-mails, that should \nhave been the end of it. Instead, he would periodically read employees\u2019 e-mails for his \nown reasons. He did not have the same responsibilities at his current employer, but he \nagain read his supervisor\u2019s e-mail without permission or authorization. His actions at the \nthree companies establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a), (c), and (e). \n \nApplicant installed company software on his home computer. He has vacillated \nbetween stating it was without permission and it was authorized. I find his statement \npursuant to a polygraph that it was without permission to be the most credible. AG \u00b6 \n40(f) has also been established. \n \nConditions that could mitigate the Use of Information Technology Systems \nsecurity concerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one\u2019s \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and   \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor.  \n \nIt has been a number of years since Applicant committed the IT conduct alleged \nin the SOR. Because Applicant has not been totally truthful, I am unable to find that the \nconduct is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 41(a) is not applicable. The actions were intentional and they \n\n \n8 \n \nwere not done in the interest of organizational efficiency and effectiveness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(b) \nand (c) have no applicability in this case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions at his current and two prior companies raised Information \nTechnology concerns, as addressed above. Those same actions are sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6 16(e), as personal conduct that created a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant denied intentionally omitting the information about his actions at his last \nthree companies from his May 7, 2003 statement. After considering all the evidence, I \nfind that it was an intentional omission designed to deceive the investigator. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(a) and (b) have been established for SOR \u00b6 1.e.  \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant falsified the August 9, \n2007 statement, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. While I find the 2007 statement to be \nsomewhat disingenuous, there is also insufficient evidence that he falsified the \n\n \n9 \n \nstatement, as specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g are concluded for \nApplicant. \n \n \nThe fact that Applicant was denied access to SCI in 2005, based upon much of \nthe conduct that is addressed in these proceedings does not independently raise any \ndisqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.h is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant no longer works for two of the companies involved. That significantly \nreduces his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. He still works for the company and supervisor \nthat were involved in part of his personal conduct. While he testified that he told his \ncurrent supervisor that he read his e-mail, the supervisor\u2019s letter does not mention this \nfact. AG \u00b6 16(e) is not applicable for SOR \u00b6 1.c. Because Applicant has been less than \ntotally truthful throughout the process, I am unable to find any other mitigating condition.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s IT issues all occurred \nseveral years ago. He is highly regarded at his current company and presented very \nfavorable character evidence. However, he presented false, incomplete, and misleading \ninformation throughout the process. The most accurate information was obtained while \nApplicant was under the scrutiny of a polygraph. Without the sword of a polygraph \nhanging over his head, Applicant cannot be trusted to provide truthful responses.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Personal Conduct and Use of Information \nTechnology Systems security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

He became a naturalized citizen in 1991.  His children were born in the United States.\nHe has worked as a computer engineer for federal contractors since 1998.  His elderly parents, three\nsiblings, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are residents and citizens of Taiwan.  In 2001, he used his\nTaiwanese passport to visit Taiwan.  The passport expired in 2003 and he has not renewed it.  He\nmitigated the security concerns raised by foreign influence and foreign preference.  Clearance is\ngranted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 19, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On March\n21, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) why DOHA could not\nmake a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.  DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.\nOn April 3, 2006, Applicant filed a response to the SOR, admitting all of the allegations, and\nelected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  On February 20, 2007,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, and\nmailed Applicant a complete copy on February 21, 2007.  The FORM also contained 12 documents\nfor which Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice.  Applicant had 30 days\nfrom receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation.  Applicant received the FORM on February 28, 2007, and submitted additional\ninformation on March 12, 2007, and objected to the relevance of some documents offered for\nadministrative notice.  Department Counsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s additional submission.  The\ncase was assigned to me on March 15, 2007.  After reviewing the 12 documents submitted for\nadministrative notice, I take notice of the information contained therein.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his response to the SOR, I\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man.  He was born in Taiwan.  He came to the United\nStates in 1975 on a student visa and never returned to Taiwan to live.  He subsequently attended a\nprestigious university in the United States and graduated with a Ph.D. in computer sciences.  He\nbecame a naturalized citizen in October 1991.

He was granted a security clearance in 2002 by the U.S. Treasury Department.  \n2\nApplicant\u2018s wife was born in Taiwan in 1957.  She became a U.S. citizen in October 1991.\nThey have two children, both born in the United States.   He does not have any financial interests\n3\nin Taiwan.   In his response he stated, \u201cAfter graduation from [the university] with Ph.D. degree, I\n4\nhave been working, paying taxes, and later after naturalization, fulfilling civic duties entirely in\nAmerica.  I never held any job or position in Taiwan or any other countries. In essence, my whole-\nlife career is in the United States.  I am of unquestioned allegiance to the United States.\u201d5\nApplicant\u2019s elderly parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Applicant calls his parents\nabout once a week and visits them in Taiwan every three or four years.  He sends them about $500\na year out of a sense of familial obligation and not financial need.  \n6\nApplicant is one of five children, all born in Taiwan.  One of his sisters is a naturalized\ncitizen and resident of the United States.  His other two sisters are retired and are citizen residents\nof Taiwan.  His brother is a dentist and a citizen resident of Taiwan.  He talks to his two sisters and\nbrother about once a year and visits them when he sees his parents.  None of his relatives have held\n7\npositions in the Taiwan government.8\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan, who\noperate a small grocery store.  Applicant\u2019s wife calls them twice a month and visits them when she\nvisits Taiwan every three or four years.  Her mother died in 1982.  Her other brother is a naturalized\nU. S. citizen, who resides in the United States.  She sends her family about $100-200 every year at\nthe Chinese New Year.  She does not own property or have any financial interests in Taiwan.9\nOver the course of the last several years, Applicant returned to Taiwan in July 2001 to\ncelebrate his father\u2019s 80  birthday.  In February 2004, he attended his grandmother\u2019s funeral.  In June\nth\n2005, he visited his parents en route to Japan for a family vacation.  \n10\nIn 1997, Applicant renewed his Taiwanese passport that was previously issued in June\n\nResponse to Form: Republic of China Passport.\n11\nItem 5 at 2.\n12\nId. at 1.\n13\nU.S. Dept. of State Background Note: Taiwan, October 2006.\n14\nNational Counterintelligence Center (NACIC),Annual Report to Congress 15 (2000), included in the FORM\n15\nas Administrative Notice Exhibit VII.\n4\n1991.  He used it to enter Taiwan in July 2001 for purpose of convenience.  That passport expired\n11\nin June 2003 and he has no intention of renewing it.  Applicant has a current U.S. passport that he\nrenewed in May 2001.  He has used it for all of his travel, except the July 2001 trip, including his\nother trips to Taiwan in 2004 and 2005.  Although he listed himself as having dual citizenship on\n12\nhis SCA, he is uncertain of his citizen\u2019s status with Taiwan because he did not renew his passport.\nHowever, he is willing to relinquish his expired Taiwan passport as his loyalties are with the U.S.13\nTaiwan is a stable multiparty democracy, a U.S. ally, and a major U.S. trading partner.  It has\na good human rights record. Taiwan maintains a large military establishment, and its primary\nmission is the defense of Taiwan against the Peoples Republic of China (PRC).  With the\nencouragement of the United States, contact between Taiwan and the PRC has grown significantly\nover the last decade, with increases in direct trade, travel, and postal links.  The Taiwan Relations\nAct, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3301-3316, is the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the United\nStates. and Taiwan and the U.S. commitment to ensuring Taiwan\u2019s defensive capability.  Taiwan\n14\nis an active collector of U.S. defense information and technology.15\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information, sets forth criteria which must be evaluated when determining security\nclearance eligibility.  Within those adjudicative guidelines are factors to consider in denying or\nrevoking an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and\nfactors to consider in granting an individual\u2019s request for access to classified information (Mitigating\nConditions).  By recognizing that individual circumstances of each case are different, the guidelines\nprovide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to\nreach a fair, impartial and common sense decision.\nGranting an applicant\u2019s clearance for access to classified information is based on a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in the individual.  Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must\ninclude consideration of not only the actual risk of disclosure of classified information, but also\nconsideration of any possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise\nclassified information.  Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting classified information. Directive, Enclosure 2,\n\u00b6 E2.2.2.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a judgment about\nan applicant\u2019s loyalty. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.\n\n5\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988).  The Directive presumes a rational connection between past proven conduct under any of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  ISCR Case\nNo. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\ncorresponding burden of rebuttal shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to overcome the position of the government.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\nclearance.\u201d Id. \nBased upon the allegations contained in the SOR and a consideration of the evidence as a\nwhole, the following adjudicative guidelines are pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence): The Concern -A security concern may exist when an\nindividual\u2019s immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she maybe\nbound by affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject\nto duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests\nin other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially\nvulnerable to coercions, exploitation, or pressure.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference): The Concern -When an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter considering all facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, I conclude the following in regard to the allegations contained in the SOR:\nGuideline B: Foreign Influence\nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions established a disqualifying condition\nunder Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (An immediate family\nmember, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen or,\nor resident or present in, a foreign country).  Applicant\u2019s parents, brother and two sisters are citizens\nand residents of Taiwan.  According to ISCR Case No. 01-03120, DOHA LEXIS 94 at 8 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 20, 2002), Applicant\u2019s father-in-law and brother-in-law also fall within the disqualification as\n\u201c[t]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the\nimmediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d\nWhile family ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, disqualifying\n\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)(quoting ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar.\n16\n29, 2002)).\nThe Appeal Board has not increased an applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion in cases involving contacts with\n17\nfamily members living in Taiwan.  This situation may be compared to the Appeal Board\u2019s decision to place a \u201cvery heavy\nburden of persuasion\u201d on applicants to demonstrate that contacts with immediate family members living in Iran do not\npose a security risk. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy\nburden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents and siblings live in Iran); ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when applicant\u2019s family members live\nin Iran).\n6\nunder Guideline B, such ties do raise a prima facie security concern.  This concern is sufficient to\nrequire an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the\napplicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance.  ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nThe Appeal \u201cBoard has warned \u2018against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between\n\u2018friendly\u2019 nations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B,\u2019\u201d  and Taiwan\n16\nshould not be labeled as \u201chostile\u201d or as \u201cfriendly\u201d to the United States.  Taiwan is in competition\nwith the United States in several areas, and is likely to continue to engage in espionage against the\nUnited States.  Taiwan\u2019s future relationship with the United States may not be as congenial as it is\ntoday.  In any event, Applicant should not be placed into a position where he may be forced to\nchoose between loyalty to the United States and his relatives living in Taiwan.  \n17\nThe Government having established a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nrebut or mitigate the allegations.  After considering all mitigating conditions under this guideline,\nin particular, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (A determination that the\nimmediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant,\nor associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\ninvolved and the United States), I conclude it provides some information that makes his situation less\nsusceptible to foreign influence than if his relatives were agents of a foreign power.  Applicant\nsupplied evidence that none of his family members, including in-laws, are associated with the\nTaiwanese government.\nIn assessing the vulnerability to exploitation of Applicant\u2019s family, it is helpful to consider\nseveral factors: the nature of the foreign government, its relationship to the United States, its human\nrights record, and a careful balancing of the nature and strength of Applicant\u2019s relationship to his\nforeign associates.  Taiwan is a stable democracy with close commercial and friendly ties to the\nUnited States.  It has improved its human rights record significantly in the past few years.  Although\nfriendly countries may have profound disagreements with the United States or may have engaged\nin espionage against the United States, especially in economic, scientific, military and technical\nfields, it is less likely that such a foreign government would attempt to exploit a United States citizen\nthrough relatives in that foreign country.  Taiwan\u2019s continuing dependence and alliance with the\nUnited States, coupled with its democratic form of government, diminishes the risk of it using\ncoercion, persuasion, or duress to exploit its citizens to gather classified information from United\nStates citizens.  Thus, Applicant\u2019s evidence showing his elderly parents, siblings, and in-laws\u2019\nabsence of governmental connections provides some information that makes his situation less\nsusceptible to foreign influence than if his relatives were residents and citizens of a foreign country\nsuch as Iran, a country known for its hostility toward the United States.\n\n7\nI also considered FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2 (Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are\ncasual and infrequent).  It provides some mitigation as to the allegations regarding his siblings with\nwhom he has limited communications (about once per year), but not to his parents with whom he\nspeaks frequently.  It is not clear from the record how often he interacts with his in-laws. \nApplicant does not have any financial interests in Taiwan.  This fact does not mitigate the\nforeign influence concern based on FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1 or FI DC E2.A2.1.2.3.  See ISCR Case No.\n04-02233 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 2006).\nI conclude no Guideline B Mitigating Conditions apply, and I expressly and specifically\nindicate that I have not relied \u201cexplicitly or implicitly\u201d on any of the Mitigating Conditions listed\nunder Guideline B of the Directive.  See ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007).  The\nmitigating information will be applied in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra.\nGuideline C: Foreign Preference\nBased on Applicant\u2019s previous maintenance and use of a Taiwanese passport after becoming\na U.S. citizen and possessing a U.S. passport, the Government established a disqualification under\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1 (The exercise of dual citizenship),\nand FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2 (Possession and/or use of a foreign passport). \nThe Government having established a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to\nrebut or mitigate the allegation.  After reviewing all of the mitigating conditions, I conclude that\nForeign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.4 (Individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship) is applicable.  Applicant\u2019s passport expired in June 2003\nand he has not renewed it.  He did not indicate what he had done with the expired passport.\nHowever, he expressed his loyalty to the U.S. in his responses to the SOR and FORM, as well as\nduring his interview. \nPossession of Expired Taiwanese Passport\nApplicant renewed his Taiwanese passport in 1997 and used it to enter Taiwan one time in\nJuly 2001.  In June 2003, the passport expired.  Its whereabouts are unknown.\nThe Memorandum of Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur L. Money, dated August 16,\n2000, hereinafter \u201cASDC3 memorandum\u201d mandates that \u201cconsistent application of the guideline\nrequires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport\nor obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States\nGovernment.\u201d \nThe Appeal Board indicated in ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) that\nthe ASDC3 memorandum requirement to surrender a passport also applied to expired passports.\nMoreover, the passport cannot be surrendered to a Department of Defense security officer, it must\nbe surrendered to the issuing authority.  ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005).\nThere was no allegation concerning the failure to surrender the Taiwanese passport under\nGuideline C (foreign preference) in this case.  \u201c[T]here is no question that Applicant was entitled\nto receive reasonable notice of the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke [her] access to\n\n8\nclassified information, as well as a reasonable opportunity to respond.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 03-06174\nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005) (citations omitted).\nOn December 29, 2005, the President approved the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines).  The President\u2019s\napproval of the Revised Guidelines was forwarded in a Memorandum from the Assistant to the\nPresident for National Security Affairs to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office that\nsame day.  This Memorandum asked the Director to, \u201c[p]lease circulate the revised guidelines to all\naffected agencies for immediate implementation.\u201d  Under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the\nRevised Guidelines, paragraph 10 (a)(1) the first disqualifying condition states, \u201cpossession of a\ncurrent foreign passport (emphasis added),\u201d effectively overruling the Appeal Board\u2019s expansive\ninterpretation of the ASDC3 memorandum as applicable to expired passports\nThe Revised Guidelines were implemented within DoD by an Under Secretary of Defense\nMemorandum dated August 30, 2006.  This Memorandum makes the Revised Guidelines applicable\nto all adjudications and other determinations in which a SOR is issued after September 1, 2006, and\nrequires that all SORs issued prior to September 1, 2006, be adjudicated under the previous\nGuidelines.  Applicant\u2019s case must be adjudicated under the previous Guidelines because Applicant\u2019s\nSOR was issued on March 21, 2006.  ISCR Case No. 03-17839 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2006)\n(White, J. separate opinion) (explaining purpose for delayed implementation is to ensure applicants\nreceive notice of particular guidelines in effect at the time the SOR is issued).  However, assuming\nthe Revised Guidelines improve and support National Security objectives, and an Applicant is not\nprejudiced by the change, an Applicant should be able to urge the DoD to apply the Revised\nGuidelines, when they are not inconsistent with the previous Guidelines, or when they clarify\napplication of the Guidelines.\nBased on said change and clarification, I conclude that the ASDC3 memorandum does not\nbar Applicant\u2019s clearance because of his possession of an expired Taiwanese passport.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the guideline, the\nadjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information\nabout the applicant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1 describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a case as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d In evaluating the conduct of an applicant, an administrative judge should\nconsider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nBecause foreign influence does not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation,\nand behavior changes, etc., the eigth factor in this series is the most relevant. \nThe Appeal Board suggests that the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative\nto his ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by\nthe facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  The Appeal Board\n\n9\npreviously recommended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 at 3 (App. Bd. June\n7, 2006), which provides:\nApplicant has been in the U.S for twenty years and a naturalized citizen for seven.\nHer husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are U.S. citizens by birth.\nHer ties to these family members are stronger than her ties to family members in\nTaiwan.  She has significant financial interests in the U.S. , and none in Taiwan.  She\ntestified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would\ndefend the interests of the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker assess her as very\nloyal and trustworthy.  \nIn the present case, there are many countervailing positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as\na U.S. citizen that weigh in favor of granting him a security clearance.  He has lived in the United\nStates for 32 years and has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 16 years.  He has close ties to the\nUnited States.  His wife, two children, sister, and brother-in-law are U.S. citizens and residents.  He\nobtained his advanced degree at a U.S. university.  He does not have a criminal background, a history\nof financial difficulties or a poor employment record.  He was granted a security clearance from the\nDepartment of the Treasury in 2002.  During the past seven years, he made three trips to Taiwan.\nHis Taiwanese passport has expired and he will not renew it.  He has no financial ties to Taiwan and\nthe amount of money he and his wife send to their parents is minimal.  He is patriotic, loves the\nUnited States and has expressed his loyalty to it. \nIn addition to the above facts, security worthiness determinations are predictive judgments\nand the best predictor of future performance is past performance.  Based on a review of his history\nand substantial ties to the United States, I conclude Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation by Taiwan,\na democratic ally of the United States, appears low and unlikely to occur.  Applicant mitigated the\nsecurity concerns raised under foreign preference and foreign influence.  Accordingly, Guideline B\nand Guideline C are decided for him. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline C (Foreign Preference)\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n10\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Cohen, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn November 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern under\nGuidelines G, H, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn November 22, 2008, Applicant filed an answer to the SOR, denying all of the\nallegations except SOR subparagraphs 2.a, and 3.a, and requesting a hearing. I\nreceived the case assignment on January 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nJanuary 14, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 17, 2009.\nDuring the hearing, I received seven government exhibits (Ex. 1-7), 17 Applicant\nexhibits (Ex. A-Q), and the testimony of five Applicant witnesses. I received the\nMarch 31, 2009\n\n2\ntranscript on February 25, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRulings of Evidence\nExhibit 4 is Applicant\u2019s Response to Written Interrogatories, notarized August 5,\n2008. It includes excerpts from an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Report of\nInvestigation (ROI) that contain the OPM agent\u2019s written summary of three personal\nsubject interviews with Applicant conducted on March 19, 2008, July 23, 2007, and\nNovember 14, 2005, respectively. Interrogatory Question 2 asked Applicant to review\nthe subject interviews, and \u201cverify the report on the last page of [the] interrogatories\u201d\n(Exhibit 4 at 2). Under Interrogatory Question 3, Applicant was asked if the ROI\naccurately reflected the information that he provided to the investigator on the days he\nwas interviewed. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d (Exhibit 4 at 3). Also, he provided a two-page\nexplanation, comprehensively discussing each personal subject interview, and\nidentifying what he believed to be inaccuracies in the investigator\u2019s written record of\nthem.\nOn February 12, 2009, Applicant\u2019s counsel filed a Motion in Limine seeking to\nexclude Exhibit 4, arguing that DoD Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E 3.1.20 prohibits the admission\nof ROIs without authenticating witnesses, and that the government cannot circumvent\nthis requirement by including the ROI with Interrogatories to Applicant, and asking him\nto authenticate it. Alternatively, he argued that the majority of the subject matter of the\nROI -  foreign contacts, foreign travel, risque internet chatroom discussions, were\nirrelevant.\nI overruled Applicant\u2019s objection as to the admissibility of the ROI excerpts.\nApplicant frequently cross-referenced the ROI in his Interrogatory Responses,\nelaborating upon it, and identifying inaccuracies. Under these circumstances, the ROI\nconstitutes non-hearsay evidence that is admissible not for the truth of the matters\nasserted within it, but to facilitate my understanding of Applicant\u2019s Interrogatory\nResponses.\nI sustained Applicant\u2019s objection as to the inadmissibility of the information within\nthe ROI about foreign contacts, foreign travel, and risque internet chatroom discussions.\nSimilarly, I did not consider information about these subjects contained within Exhibit 4.\nNone of this information is listed in the SOR. Although SORs are not criminal\nindictments, they must be drafted, at minimum, with enough specificity to put applicants\non notice of the nature of the allegations. The government alleged no security concerns\nunder the Foreign Influence or Sexual Behavior guidelines, therefore, I considered none\nof the information in the ROI covering these subjects.\n\n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old married man with two teenage children. He earned a\nBachelor of Science degree in computer science in 1983 and a Master of Science in\ncomputer engineering in 1985 (Tr. 152). He has spent his career developing\ncryptograph standards for financial institutions, and developing network security\nsystems (Tr. 77 - Supervisor\u2019s Testimony). Currently, he is a senior-level supervisor for\na defense contractor who supervises \u201cabout 30 individuals doing security research in\ncomputer security . . .\u201d (Id.). He is an excellent employee who deftly balances multiple\nroles at his company, and delivers high quality products to clients in a timely manner\n(Tr. 43 - Testimony of Former Supervisor). He has held a security clearance for nearly\n20 years (Tr. 187).\nApplicant has a drinking problem. For the majority of his life, his alcohol\nconsumption was \u201cfairly normal\u201d (Tr. 156). In 2000, his desire to drink gradually began\nto increase. By approximately 2001, he was drinking alcohol daily, socializing less, and\nisolating himself from his family to conceal the extent of his alcohol consumption (Tr.\n158; see also, Exhibit 5 at 11). \nAs Applicant\u2019s drinking problem worsened, his health deteriorated. Also, it began\nto affect his work, as he increasingly awoke with hangovers, arrived to work late, or took\nsick leave (Tr. 159). He never drank at work (Tr. 159). \nOn July 12, 2006, Applicant checked into an alcohol-rehabilitation clinic, and took\na leave of absence form his job (Tr. 161, 165). By then, he had been consuming a half\nof a fifth of liquor every evening (Tr. 164). A psychiatrist at the clinic diagnosed him with\nalcohol dependence (Exhibit 5 at 17).  \nOn July 21, 2006, Applicant transferred to another inpatient alcohol-rehabilitation\nclinic where he attended through August 18, 2006 (Answer). The program consisted of\nindividual and group counseling, in addition to educational activities (Exhibit F).\nApplicant completed all aspects of the program successfully (Exhibit F). Upon\ndischarge, he received a good prognosis to remain sober (Exhibit G). His counselor\nrecommended that he attend Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous (AA) meetings daily for three\nmonths, obtain a sponsor, and work with the sponsor \u201con a regular basis\u201d (Exhibit 6 at\n9).\nCurrently, Applicant remains involved with AA. He is active in AA outreach,\nexpanding groups to other areas in his community (Tr. 173). He chairs one group and is\nthe treasurer of another (Tr. 102-103 - Testimony of AA Sponsor). He has not drunk any\nalcohol since he entered the in-patient treatment center in July 2006. His health,\nemotional well-being, and relationship with his family have improved since he stopped\ndrinking.\n\n4\nApplicant has continued to meet with his counselor since his discharge from the\nalcohol treatment center. His counselor reiterated that his prognosis for continued\nsobriety remains good (Exhibit G).\nApplicant smoked marijuana monthly for approximately 25 years. He began at\nage 14, smoking it once or twice per week (Tr. 182). By college, his use had increased\nto several times per week (Tr. 183). After graduating, he continued to smoke marijuana\n\u201cconsistently, several times a week, throughout [his] young and middle adult life\u201d (Tr.\n184). He used it primarily at home, but \u201con some occasions at parties or when visiting\nwith friends\u201d (Tr. 209). \nBy the time he entered his 40s, Applicant\u2019s use had declined to \u201cmaybe several\ntimes a month\u201d (Tr. 184). He gradually quit smoking marijuana entirely in 2004 (Id.). He\ndecided to quit because he grew increasingly wary of the bad example he would be\nsetting for his children if they were to discover his marijuana use. He continues to\nsocialize with some of the people with whom he used marijuana in the past (Tr. 209).\nApplicant did not disclose his marijuana use, as required, on a security clearance\napplication completed in January 2005 (Tr. 190). Although he had stopped smoking by\nthen, he \u201cstill had the illusion that [he] could continue the lie that [he] had been\nperpetuating\u201d since 1989, when he was untruthful about the extent of his use on his\noriginal security clearance application (Tr. 192, see also, Tr. 203-204). \nIn late 2005, Applicant met with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel\nManagement (Tr. 207). He then disclosed his marijuana use in response to a question\nfrom the investigator (Id.). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d Applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nAlcohol Consumption\nUnder this guideline, \u201cexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise\nof questionable judgment or failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). Here, Applicant\u2019s lost control of\nhis alcohol consumption prompting him to seek in-patient treatment. Upon beginning the\ntreatment, a psychiatrist diagnosed him with alcohol dependence. AG \u00b6 22(c), \u201chabitual\nor binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent, and AG\n\u00b6 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence,\u201d apply.\nApplicant successfully completed inpatient treatment, and successfully followed\nthe discharge plan. He remains active in AA, chairing meetings, and participating in\noutreach projects. He has not drunk any alcohol since completing inpatient treatment in\n2006, and received a favorable prognosis upon his discharge. In 2009, his counselor\nreiterated his favorable prognosis. AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome\nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent), or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser), and AG \u00b6 23 (d), \u201cthe individual has successfully\ncompleted inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required\naftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in\nmeeting of AA or a similar organization, and has received a favorable prognosis by a\nstaff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d apply.\nDrug Involvement\n\u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment, and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant\u2019s 25 years of marijuana use, much of which\noccurred while possessing a security clearance, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 25(a),\n\n6\n\u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance.\u201d\nApplicant has not smoked marijuana in five years. Given the length of time he\nsmoked it, the frequency of his use, and the fact that he still socializes with some of the\npeople with whom he had used marijuana, it is too soon to conclude that either AG \u00b6\n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b)1), \u201cdisassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts,\u201d or AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \u201can appropriate period of\nabstinence,\u201d apply.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d Of particular interest is any failure to provide truthful answers during the\nsecurity clearance process (Id.). \nApplicant admits to deliberately failing to disclose his marijuana use on a 2005\nsecurity clearance application. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d applies. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply.\nApplicant did not disclose the falsification until approximately nine months later, in\nresponse to a question from an investigative agent who had contacted him to arrange\nan interview. Moreover, this was not the first time he falsified a security clearance\napplication. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct\nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\n\n7\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant testified insightfully about the link between his on-the-job stress and his\nabuse of marijuana and alcohol. Having completed alcohol counseling, he appears to\nhave learned the dangers of using alcohol to reduce stress. He also recognizes that\nusing marijuana in this manner is similarly harmful. He appears to sincerely appreciate\nthe beneficial effects to his family relationships and health that have accompanied his\nabstinence from marijuana and alcohol.\nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s alcohol dependence no longer poses a security\nconcern. I am not prepared to conclude, however, that his marijuana abuse no longer\nposes a security concern. Unlike alcohol use, marijuana use is illegal. Applicant used\nmarijuana regularly for more than 20 years. This included approximately 15 years of\nuninterrupted use after he was granted a security clearance in 1990.\nAlso, Applicant falsified two security clearance applications regarding his\nmarijuana use, and did not disclose it until an investigative agent asked him about it\nduring an interview. Consequently, although the presence of rehabilitation is evident, it\nis outweighed by the recency, severity, and extent of the conduct. Evaluating this case\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 20, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On November 28, 2008, DOHA assigned the \ncase to me and issued a Notice of Hearing on December 16, 2008. The case was heard \non January 14, 2009, as scheduled. The parties stipulated to the introduction of the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, and Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) A through Q into \nevidence. Applicant testified in his case-in-chief. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on January 26, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nparagraphs 1.a, 1.c and 1.e. He admitted the allegations contained in paragraph 1.b, \nbut denied that he was ordered to attend 10 hours of alcohol counseling. He admitted \nthe allegations contained in paragraph 1.d, but denied that he was found guilty of DUI. \nHe denied the allegations contained in paragraph 2, except those contained in \nparagraph 2.b which he admitted. His admissions are incorporated into the following \nfindings: \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and divorced. He was married for 14 years and has a \n19-year old daughter. He and his wife share custody of their daughter. After graduating \nfrom college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting, he was an account manager and \ncomptroller for a medium size subcontracting company with revenues between $25 and \n$50 million for several years. (Tr. 16) He then owned his own business and later worked \nas a consultant for other companies. For the last 15 years, he has worked in the \ncomputer technology field. Last summer, he obtained a Master of Science degree in \nInformation Technology.  \n \n \nApplicant began his current position with a defense contractor in October 2002. \nAs an IT project manager, he is responsible for budgeting and scheduling various jobs \nand about 30 people. He was granted an Interim Secret security clearance in 2004 that \nwas revoked pending this proceeding. Since working in this position, he has received \nperformance evaluations that rate him as meeting or exceeding expectations for the \nyears 2003 to 2007, resulting in increases in his compensation. (AE J) \n  \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in his late teens while in high school. (Tr. \n35). He continued to consume alcohol during and after leaving college, but was never \nconvicted of any alcohol-related incidents until middle age.  \n \n \n \nApplicant has five alcohol-related criminal incidents in his background. In July \n1998, he was driving home after having a couple beers at a local bar when the police \nstopped him for going the wrong way down a one-way street. He refused a breathalyzer \ntest and failed a field sobriety test. He was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under \nthe Influence of Alcohol (DUI); (2) Expired registration; and (3) Driving the Wrong-Way \n\n \n3 \n \n \non a One-way Street. In June 1999, he pleaded guilty to Alcohol Related Improper \nControl by Driver and Driving the Wrong-Way on a One-way Street. (Tr. 40-47) This first \nincident occurred in State 1. He was 42 years old at the time. He denied that he was \nintoxicated at the time of this arrest. (Tr. 78; GE  3) \n \n \nIn May 2001, Applicant had dinner with a couple co-workers. After leaving the \nrestaurant, the police stopped him for speeding and requested that he take a \nbreathalyzer test. Applicant refused the test and was arrested. He was charged with (1) \nDUI; and (2) Speeding. In October 2001, he pleaded guilty to a charge of Alcohol \nRelated Reckless, and the Speeding charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to 60 \ndays in jail (suspended), and fined $1,800 ($900 suspended). (GE 3) He was placed on \n12 months supervised probation and ordered to obtain an alcohol assessment, which he \ndid. (Tr. 52) The next time he appeared in court, the judge did not have the evidence of \nthe assessment results, and consequently he did not order Applicant to attend alcohol \ncounseling. (T. 53) This incident also occurred in State 1. During the hearing, he \nadmitted that he had been drinking several hours before being stopped by the police, \nbut denied that he was intoxicated at the time. (Tr. 81) \n \n \nIn September 2004, Applicant attended a family reunion in State 2. On his way \nback to his hotel, he made an illegal U-turn and ran a red light. After being stopped by \nthe police, he took a breathalyzer test that he failed. He was arrested and charged with \n(1) Operating While Under the Influence (OWUI); and (2) Improper Turn on Red. He \npleaded guilty to the OWUI and the other charge was dismissed. He was fined $1,250 \nand his State 3 driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. (GE 4; Tr. 58) The court \nordered him to complete an alcohol assessment/driver\u2019s safety course. He admitted that \nhe was under the influence of alcohol at the time he was arrested. (Tr. 54) About four \nyears later, in August 2008, he started attending the court-ordered classes, consisting of \neight hours of instruction. He completed the course in October 2008. (AE O; P) He did \nnot take the classes sooner because he could not locate an appropriate course in his \nthen-resident state (State 3) before that. (Tr. 57) He found the classes to be educational \nand informative. (Tr. 70)  \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant consumed a couple alcoholic beverages after work \nwith friends. He then went to study at a local coffee shop. While he was driving home \naround 10:30 p.m., he swerved his car to avoid hitting a cat and ran into a tree. (Tr. 111) \nThe police took him to the hospital where he was treated for a concussion. He walked \nout of the hospital a couple hours later without being discharged. The following morning, \nhe telephoned the police and learned that he was ticketed for a DUI and his car was \nimpounded. He does not remember walking home from the hospital in the early morning \nor any other details from the accident. (GE 5; Tr. 111) Because he never received any \nlegal documents after the incident, he did not think charges were filed. However, \ncharges were filed and he missed a hearing on the DUI, resulting in an automatic \nsuspension of his State 3 driver\u2019s license.1 (Tr. 92) During the hearing, he admitted that \n                                                          \n1 Applicant has had driver\u2019s licenses issued from State 1 and State 3. Both licenses have been \nsuspended at some point. The record is not clear as to the exact time frame of those suspensions or \nwhen the licenses were obtained. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhe had consumed alcohol prior to the accident, but denied that he was intoxicated. (Tr. \n62-63; 86) He reported this incident to his employer in January 2007. (AE Q) The \ncriminal DUI charges were later dismissed. (AE A)   \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was stopped by the police after he failed to make a \ncomplete stop at a stop sign in State 3. He was arrested by the police and charged with \nDrive While License Suspended for Driving Under the Influence. After the arrest, he \nhired a lawyer and learned of the specific DUI charges of October 2006 and that his \nlicense was suspended. (Tr. 64) He also found out from the police report that he had \nbeen hospitalized after the accident. (Tr. 114) He subsequently biked or took the train to \nwork until the suspension expired in December 2007. (Tr. 97; 115)2 \n \n \nIn the fall of 2008, Applicant made an appointment with a certified substance \nabuse counselor for an alcohol evaluation in preparation for this hearing. (Tr. 106) After \nan hour and a half interview, the counselor determined that Applicant \u201cdoes not meet \nthe criteria for Alcohol Dependency.\u201d (AE K; Tr. 104) The counselor noted in his brief \nNovember 2008 report that Applicant was attending a counseling center for DUI classes \nfor his 2004 conviction. (Id.) \n \n \n \nOver the course of his life, Applicant has abstained from consuming alcohol \nduring stressful periods. (Tr. 78) The last time Applicant consumed alcohol was on July \n15, 2008, at his daughter\u2019s birthday party. (Tr. 38) Prior to that day, he had a glass of \nwine on Memorial Day. (39) He has not had an alcoholic drink during the past six \nmonths because consuming alcohol has \u201ccaused a lot of problems. It turned out to be \nvery expensive. And it doesn\u2019t seem to be worth the trouble.\u201d (Tr. 39) He does not \nbelieve he is an alcoholic nor that he has a problem with alcohol. (Id.; Tr. 108; 124) He \ndoes not intend to use alcohol in the foreseeable future. (Tr. 74) Up to March 2008, he \nadmitted that he was still consuming alcohol. \n \nFour of Applicant\u2019s accomplished colleagues submitted letters in support of \nApplicant, attesting to his reliability, integrity and trustworthiness, especially as it relates \nto handling classified information. They have known him since he began working for \ntheir current employer in 2004. All of them are aware of the alcohol security concerns \nunderlying this proceeding. (AE C, D, E, and F) Two of Applicant\u2019s former college \nroommates submitted strong letters of recommendation. They are aware of Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol-related charges, but do not believe that he has an alcohol problem. (AE H; I) \nApplicant\u2019s former wife also submitted a letter on his behalf. She has observed him over \nthe years and does not think he abuses alcohol. (AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n                                                          \n2It is not clear from the record as to the disposition of this January 2007 charge. \n\n \n5 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an applicant shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the Government\u2019s security concern pertaining to criminal \nconduct: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person \nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \n Applicant was arrested and/or charged with alcohol-related offenses in 1998, \n2001, 2004 and 2006. There is sufficient evidence to raise significant security concerns \nunder the above-cited disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides five conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline, two of which may be potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or \ngood judgment;  \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without the recurrence of criminal activity, remorse \nor restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal arrest was in October 2006, about two years ago. This \nincident involved alcohol consumption, as did four preceding arrests. Hence, the \nOctober incident did not occur under such unusual circumstances that would make it \nunlikely to recur, as required for the application of AG \u00b6 32 (a).  \n \nApplicant provided some evidence of rehabilitation. He has not been involved in \nany alcohol-related charge for two years, has a good employment record with his \nemployer over the past four years, and appears remorseful about the criminal charges. \nHe also presented evidence of completing an alcohol counseling course in October \n2008, which was court-ordered in September 2004. Based on his four-year delay in \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncomplying with the court\u2019s mandate, AG \u00b6 32 (d) has less mitigating weight than would \notherwise be the case.   \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:  \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22, one of which is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \nApplicant has four alcohol-related criminal charges in his history: a DUI in 1998, \na DUI in 2001, a DUI in 2004, and a DUI in 2006. The Government established security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 22(a).  \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this guideline are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not provide mitigation for the reasons set forth under AG \u00b6 32 \n(a) above.  \nApplicant denied that he has an alcohol problem, but acknowledged that it has \ncaused him expensive difficulties over the past ten years. As a consequence, he \nasserted that he has not consumed alcohol for the past six months. Applicant provided \nan alcohol evaluation that he obtained in preparation for this hearing and as evidence of \nactions he has taken to address his concerns. The evaluation was performed by a \ncertified alcohol counselor who was not a duly qualified medical professional, such as a \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or a licensed clinical social worker who is a \nstaff member of a recognized treatment program, as required under the guidelines. The \nevaluation consisted of a brief interview of Applicant, resulting in a final opinion that \ndoes not address elements routinely contained in standard psychological or psychiatric \nevaluations of this nature. Hence, the evaluation is given little weight and does not \ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s assertions that he has taken steps to address any of his alcohol-\nrelated concerns. AG \u00b6 23(b) has no application to the concerns raised. \nThe record evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 23(c). Applicant \ndid not participate in a formalized substance abuse treatment program, as contemplated \nunder this guideline; hence, AG \u00b6 23(d) is not applicable either. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including Applicant\u2019s candid \n\n \n9 \n \n \ntestimony. Applicant is an intelligent and very successful 52-year-old man, who has \nworked for his employer for the last four years and received the support of many \naccomplished colleagues. The outpouring of support is impressive. \n \nApplicant began having problems with alcohol in 1998 and they continued up to \nOctober 2006. He has four separate arrests for DUI and three convictions. His driver\u2019s \nlicenses have been suspended for significant periods of time as a result. He \nacknowledged that he had consumed alcohol before each incident, but denied that he \nwas intoxicated, except on one occasion. He believes that he should never consume \nalcohol and drive again, but does not think he has an alcohol problem, despite the DUIs. \nHe decided to stop drinking in July 2008, about six months ago, and one month later \nmanaged to comply with a court order entered four years earlier. This alcohol \nassessment/driver\u2019s safety course was also two years after the serious October 2006 \nincident. While he now appears to appreciate the significance of his criminal history and \nthe adverse effect it may have on his employment, he has been dilatory, and possibly \nstubborn, in not addressing his acknowledged concerns sooner, especially in light of his \npursuit of a security clearance since August 2004. It is particularly troublesome that two \nmonths after submitting an SF 86, he was convicted of a DUI, but waited four years to \ntake the eight hours of alcohol-related counseling, as ordered. That delay exemplifies \nan underlying lack of good judgment or willingness to comply with rules. Without \nsubstantive independent evidence to corroborate his assertions that he does not have \nan alcohol problem, the record does not contain sufficient evidence of rehabilitation or \nmitigation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under criminal \nconduct and alcohol consumption guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly not consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

And, he responded\n\u201cyes\u201d to Question 39, and provided the name of an additional creditor. \n3\napproximate amount of $346.00, and that the debt was placed for collection in about August 1999.\nThis debt is being handled by ECC.\nSOR Allegation 1f: Applicant had cosigned on a student loan for his son. The debt went\ndelinquent but has since been satisfied by the son (Exhibit B).\nSOR Allegations 1g and 1h: Exhibit C establishes that these IRS debts have been satisfied.\nSOR Allegation 1i: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$424.00. This debt was placed for collection in about March 2000, and is being handled by ECC.\nSOR Allegation 1j: This past-due student loan debt stood at $5,150.21 as of September 15,\n2006 (Exhibit D). Applicant worked out a repayment schedule with the creditor in mid-2006 which\nrequires him to make monthly payments of $55.00 beginning on August 7, 2006 (Exhibit 2).\nSOR Allegation 1k: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$128.00. The account was placed for collection in 2001, and is being handled by ECC.\nSOR Allegation 1l: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$199.00.

This debt has been delinquent since May 2004, and is being handled by ECC.\nSOR Allegation 1n: Applicant satisfied this $236.00 debt (Exhibit F; TR at 36-37).\nSOR Allegation1o: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$721.00. This debt was placed for collection in April 2005, and is being handled by ECC.\nApplicant testified that he began experiencing financial problems in the 1990s after he was\ninjured at work. He was out of work for eight to nine months and was unable to collect workers\ncompensation benefits or any other type of aid. He has been unable to work his way out of his\nfinancial problems since then.\nApplicant completed and executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) in 2004 (Exhibit\n1). The Government alleges that he intentionally provided false information about his financial\ncondition when he responded to Questions 38 and 39. Although applicant\u2019s responses to these two\nquestions were less than perfect, when his responses to all of the financial questions are viewed as\na whole,  it is clear that he put the Government on notice that he had experienced significant\n1\n\n It is not clear if the IRS debts were satisfied by voluntary payments or involuntary\n2\npayments (e.g., applying applicant\u2019s income tax refunds).\n4\nfinancial problems. I therefore find that applicant did not intend to mislead the Government.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence establishes that (1) applicant has been experiencing significant financial\ndifficulties since the 1990s, and (2) he is still indebted to eight creditors for past-due debts in the\napproximate total amount of $8,000.00. Applicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations  reflects\nadversely on his judgment and reliability, and suggests he cannot be relied upon to safeguard\nclassified information. With respect to the Financial Considerations guideline, Disqualifying\nConditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts) are applicable.\nGiven applicant\u2019s credible testimony concerning how his financial difficulties began, he\nqualifies for Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control).\nApplicant has been with his current employer since April 2004. Since then, he has done very\nlittle to address his delinquent debts. Although his two IRS debts  have been satisfied, and he has\n2\nreduced his student loan debt over the years, he did nothing to address the debts listed in SOR\nParagraphs 1d, 1e, 1i, 1k, 1l, 1m and 1o until he contacted ECC in September 2006, after the SOR\nwas issued. And since contacting ECC and making at most two payments to them, he has stopped\ncommunicating with them. These facts preclude application of Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.6\n(the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts).\nAt the present time, applicant is having trouble making ends meet. When questioned about\nhis monthly cash flow, applicant testified that just this month he secured a part time job, which will\nprovide him with an additional $1,200.00 per month and give him a positive monthly cash flow.\nHopefully this new job works out for applicant. Having just secured it, however, it is too soon to\ndetermine if it will work out and provide applicant the additional income that applicant believes it\nwill.\nBased on the evidence presented, applicant has been experiencing significant financial\ndifficulties for ten years. These difficulties continue, as evidenced by his inability to follow through\nwith ECC. Applicant\u2019s financial situation fits squarely within the Financial Guideline Concern\nexpressed in the Directive (E2.A6.1.1.1 - An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.). Based on this fact, I have no choice but to\nconclude that it is not now clearly consistent with the national interest for applicant to have access\nto classified information.\n\n5\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: FOR THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May\n15, 2007, Department Counsel filed a Motion for Expedited Remand.  On May 16, 2007, Applicant\nfiled a response to the government\u2019s motion stating that he had no objection. The case was remanded\nto the Judge on May 29, 2007.  On June 15, 2007, the Judge again denied Applicant\u2019s request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nApplicant argues that the Judge erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that Applicant was\nvulnerable to foreign influence, because Applicant had previously been granted clearances and had\nheld them without adverse incidents under ostensibly similar circumstance to those in this\ncase\u2014family members in Iran with whom he had periodic contact.  In the alternative, Applicant\nargues that the Judge erred, as a matter of law, in concluding that Applicant had not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns inasmuch the favorable evidence presented by the Applicant,\nincluding his testimony as to his strong ties to the United States and willingness to abide by security\nregulations and his favor character references, had not been refuted by the government.  The Board\ndoes not find these arguments persuasive.\nThe Board has previously noted that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n00318 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004); ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005).  On\nthe contrary, \u201cthere is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v.\nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Prior security\nth\nclearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have no bearing on the legal\nsufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision here. See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 5\n(App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).   The government is not estopped from making an adverse clearance\ndecision when there were prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-24506 at 3\n(App. Bd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider the security\nsignificance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or circumstances\nhaving negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 91-0775 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25,\n1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires\nthe exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2003).  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as\na whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice\nversa.  Applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the record evidence, or an ability to\n\n3\nargue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nApplicant had the burden of presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate or mitigate facts\nthat the Department Counsel proved or that Applicant admitted regarding his foreign family ties.\nApplicant also had the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance\ndecision.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge had to evaluate the facts and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s\npast  and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide whether\nApplicant had met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The fact that Applicant\u2019s\nexplanations and his mitigating evidence did not lead the Judge to the decision desired by Applicant\ndoes not establish error.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge\nto make a favorable security clearance decision.\nA review of the Judge\u2019s decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances, and considered the\npossible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of\nApplicant under Guidelines C and E, and articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any\nmitigating conditions or factors with respect to the Guideline B allegations.  He reasonably explained\nwhy the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision exhibits a discerning weighing of a number\nof variables to reach a commonsense determination. Directive \u00b6 E2.2.  In some instances, as noted\nearlier, this process led to favorable findings for Applicant.  However, the Judge also articulated a\nreasonable concern that Applicant's circumstances could potentially make him vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation or pressure.  That concern is based close family ties in Iran, considered in the\ncontext of the overall political/security profile of that country vis-a-vis the United States.  Applicant\noffers an alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  However, that alternative interpretation\nof the record evidence is insufficient to render the Judge\u2019s interpretation arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-19101 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2006).  The Judge has\narticulated a rational explanation for his unfavorable determination under the disqualifying and\nmitigating factors and the whole-person concept, and there is sufficient record evidence to support\nthat determination\u2014given the standard that required the Judge to err on the side of national security.\n\n4\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Michael Y.

The evidence establishes that Applicant is vulnerable to Foreign Influence. Although he\napplied for and was issued an Iranian passport, after he became a United States citizen,  he never\nused the Iranian passport, and he has now destroyed it and indicated a willingness to renounce his\nIranian citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s failure to give complete information to the Government in a\nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) was due to a misunderstanding, not an attempt to mislead the\nGovernment. Based on the Foreign Influence concerns, mitigation has not been shown. Clearance\nis denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), dated November 8, 2006, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should\nbe granted, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns\nbecause of the foreign residency and citizenship of family members, Foreign Preference (Guideline\nC) concerns related to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Iran, and Personal\nConduct (Guideline E) concerns because of alleged falsification of material facts on a SCA.\nApplicant filed a notarized response dated December 5, 2006, to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn February 6, 2007, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision, but it was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on March\n6, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on February 9, 2007, and the hearing was\nconducted on March 14, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through\n8) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered two documentary exhibits at the hearing (Exhibits\nA and B) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on March 30, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through  1.c., under Guideline B, two allegations,\n2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline C., and one allegation, 3.a., under Guideline E.  Allegation 1.c. was\namended at the hearing to indicate that rather than Applicant having three nieces who are residents\nand citizens of Iran, he actually has two nieces and one nephew who are residents and citizens of Iran\nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.c., 2.a., and 2.b. The admissions are incorporated herein\nas Findings of Fact. \n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is a 45 year old employee of a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. He received a Bachelor\u2019s degree\nand a Master\u2019s Degree from United States universities.  \nApplicant was born in Iran in 1958. He served two years of mandatory military service while\nin Iran. He came to the United States in 1979, and he became a naturalized United States citizen in\n1986. He is  married and has two children. His wife was born in the United States and is a United\nStates citizen.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation\nwho are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. \nApplicant's father and mother are citizens and residents of  Iran. His father is 84 and his\nmother is 79. She has always been a housewife, and he is retired, but had previously worked as a\nbank manage.r Applicant talks to them two to four times a month. He last saw them in 2001, when\nhe met them in Amsterdam and then brought them back to the U. S., where they stayed for two or\nthree months.\nApplicant\u2019s brother also is a citizen and resident of  Iran. Applicant knows that his brother\nworks for the Iranian government, but he does not now in what capacity. He does not call his brother\ndirectly, but speaks to him when he has placed a call to his parents\u2019 house, and his brother is there.\nHe estimates that he spoke to his brother two to four times in the last year. \nApplicant\u2019s brother has three children, two daughters and one son, who also are citizens and\nresidents of Iran, but they attend a boarding school in France during the academic year. He\ncommunicates with them once every four to six months. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.\nApplicant does not consider himself a dual citizen of Iran and the United States. However,\nhe applied for an Iranian passport which was issued in 1999, even though he was a United States\ncitizen, and he renewed the passport in 2004. He never used his Iranian passport.\nApplicant relinquished his Iranian passport to his attorney on March 9, 2007, which he cut\nup and burned. Exhibit A is a series of pictures showing Applicant\u2019s destroyed Iranian  passport. \n\n4\nWhile Applicant does not believe that he is a citizen of Iran, he indicated that he would be willing\nto renounce his Iranian citizenship. \nApplicant has not traveled to Iran since 1979.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe falsified material facts on a SCA that he executed on December 6, 2005 (Exhibit 1). Question #21\nasks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with of convicted of any felony offenses?\u201d Applicant answered\n\u201cNo\u201d, and it is the Government\u2019s allegation that he should have listed his arrest on July 13, 1983,\non three felony charges of Kidnaping, Sexual assault and Criminal Trespass. \nAt the hearing,  Applicant testified that these were false charges brought against him by his\ngirlfriend at the time and her mother for his failure to marry the girlfriend. When the case came to\ntrial, no witnesses appeared against him, so the judge dismissed all charges in the case and refunded\nthe $1,000 that he had posted for bail. The judge informed him that this would be expunged from\nhis record. Applicant stated that he answered question #21 negatively, because he did not believe he\nhad been charged. I find that Applicant did not knowingly furnish false information to the\nGovernment in his SCA, but believed he was answering the question correctly.\nCurrent Status of Iran\nSince members of Applicant\u2019s family are citizens and residents of Iran, it is relevant to\nexamine the status and the nature of the country. Currently, Iran is considered one of the most\ndangerous adversaries to the interests of the United States. The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations\nwith Iran since April 7, 1980, following the November 1979 Iranian student occupation of the\nAmerican Embassy in Tehran and the hostage taking of 52 Americans, which was supported by\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s leader at the time.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are not limited\nto the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of mass destruction, (2) its\nsponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into the internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its\naggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and (5) its human rights violation\nagainst its own people. As a result of these concerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\n \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a character letter from an individual, who is a Technical Director for part\nof the Air Force Research Laboratory, and has known the Applicant for more than two years (Exhibit\nB). He knows him in both business and social settings. He indicated that Applicant\u2019s to the United\nStates is very strong and he would not do anything to compromise the trust that has been placed in\nhim.\nPOLICIES\n\n5\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account\nin reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the\npertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative\ndecision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and\nsurrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which\nthe conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences\ninvolved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\npotential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct\nwill continue or recur in the future. See Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.\nBecause each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be\nassumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in\nevery case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be\nsufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available\ninformation reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or\nemotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common\nsense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and\nconclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the\ntrier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.\nDecisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a\nsecurity concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence\nof criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government\nraise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy\nburden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \"the clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\" Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security. See Enclosure 2 to the Directive,\nSection E2.2.2.\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with\nrespect to Guidelines B, C and E:\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has established a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign\ninfluence. As Applicant\u2019s father and mother, with whom he has a close personal relationship, are\ncitizens and residents of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the\nUnited States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this family members do not pose\na security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). \nThe Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes\nApplicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties\nraises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 8, 2001). This, Applicant has not been able to do. \n  The existence of Applicant\u2019s parents and brother, who are citizens and residents of Iran,\ncomes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) (a), contact with family members, if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.  I can not\nfind that any Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply, based on the nature and closeness of the relationship\nof Applicant with his parents, and the great and continuing threat posed by Iran.\nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence, I conclude\nthat the evidence supporting the SOR substantially outweighs any mitigating evidence.\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nGuideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States. Applicant\u2019s application for an Iranian passport, while a United States\ncitizen, must be considered adversely to Applicant and it raises serious Foreign Preference\n(Guideline C) concerns. However, his destruction of that passport and the fact that he had never used\nit, considered with his willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship, must be considered positively\nfor Applicant. \nDC (a) (1) and (2) apply because of Applicant possession of his Iranian passport after he\nbecame a United States citizen and his Iranian military service. I find that because of Applicant\u2019s\nstated willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship, MC (b) applies in this case under Guideline\n\n7\nC. Also, MC (c) applies because Applicant\u2019s military service occurred before Applicant became a\nU.S. citizen, and MC (e) applies because his Iranian passport, which he never used,  has been\ndestroyed. Applicant has mitigated the Guideline C concerns.\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s there were charges\nagainst Applicant but they were dismissed. However, based on his credible testimony that he\nbelieved since the case was dismissed and he was told it would be expunged from his record, he\nbelieve that the correct answer to question #21 on his SCA was \u201cNo.\u201d \nIn reviewing the DC under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC  applies. I resolve Guideline\nE for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3. a.: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames Krueger, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant  has a close relationship with his father and mother, who are citizens and residents\nof Iran. The evidence establishes that Applicant is vulnerable to Foreign Influence. An additional\ncharacter letter has now been reviewed and considered. However, the Foreign Influence concerns\nhave not been mitigated. Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\n(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR), dated November 8, 2006, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should\nbe granted, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns\nbecause of the foreign residency and citizenship of family members, Foreign Preference (Guideline\nC) concerns related to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Iran, and Personal\nConduct (Guideline E) concerns because of alleged falsification of material facts on a SCA.\nApplicant filed a notarized response dated December 5, 2006, to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.\nOn February 6, 2007, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a\nhearing and issue a written decision, but it was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on March\n6, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on February 9, 2007, and the hearing was\nconducted on March 14, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 through\n8) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his attorney,  offered two documentary exhibits\nat the hearing (Exhibits A and B) and offered his own testimony. The record was held open to allow\nApplicant to submit a copy of Exhibit B, a character letter already admitted into evidence, but with\nthe signature of  the author. The transcript (Tr) was received on March 30, 2007.\nOn May 3, 2007, I issued a written decision denying Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance. On May 15, 2007, Department Counsel filed a Motion for Expedited Remand. On May\n16, 2007,  Applicant joined in Department Counsel\u2019s motion. The Appeal Board  issued a Summary\nRemand on May 29, 2007, requesting further processing of the case. This has now been done.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains three allegations, 1.a., through  1.c., under Guideline B, two allegations,\n2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline C., and one allegation, 3.a., under Guideline E.  Allegation 1.c. was\namended at the hearing to indicate that rather than Applicant having three nieces who are residents\nand citizens of Iran, he actually has two nieces and one nephew who are residents and citizens of Iran\nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., 1.c., 2.a., and 2.b. The admissions are incorporated herein\nas Findings of Fact. \n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of\nthat evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is a 45 year old employee of a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. He received a Bachelor\u2019s degree\nand a Master\u2019s Degree from United States universities.  \nApplicant was born in Iran in 1958. He served two years of mandatory military service while\nin Iran. He came to the United States in 1979, and he became a naturalized United States citizen in\n1986. He is  married and has two children. His wife was born in the United States and is a United\nStates citizen.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation\nwho are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. \nApplicant's father and mother are citizens and residents of  Iran. His father is 84 and his\nmother is 79. She has always been a housewife, and he is retired, but had previously worked as a\nbank manager. Applicant talks to them two to four times a month. He last saw them in 2001, when\nhe met them in Amsterdam and then brought them back to the U.

Applicant knows that his brother\nworks for the Iranian government, but he does not now in what capacity. He does not call his brother\ndirectly, but speaks to him when he has placed a call to his parents\u2019 house, and his brother is there.\nHe estimates that he spoke to his brother two to four times in the last year. \nApplicant\u2019s brother has three children, two daughters and one son, who also are citizens and\nresidents of Iran, but they attend a boarding school in France during the academic year. He\ncommunicates with them once every four to six months. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States.\nApplicant does not consider himself a dual citizen of Iran and the United States. However,\nhe applied for an Iranian passport which was issued in 1999, even though he was a United States\ncitizen, and he renewed the passport in 2004. He never used his Iranian passport.\nApplicant relinquished his Iranian passport to his attorney on March 9, 2007, which he cut\nup and burned. Exhibit A is a series of pictures showing Applicant\u2019s destroyed Iranian  passport.\nWhile Applicant does not believe that he is a citizen of Iran, he indicated that he would be willing\nto renounce his Iranian citizenship. \n\n4\nApplicant has not traveled to Iran since 1979.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe falsified material facts on a SCA that he executed on December 6, 2005 (Exhibit 1). Question #21\nasks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with of convicted of any felony offenses?\u201d Applicant answered\n\u201cNo\u201d, and it is the Government\u2019s allegation that he should have listed his arrest on July 13, 1983,\non three felony charges of Kidnaping, Sexual assault and Criminal Trespass. \nAt the hearing,  Applicant testified that these were false charges brought against him by his\ngirlfriend at the time and her mother for his failure to marry the girlfriend. When the case came to\ntrial, no witnesses appeared against him, so the judge dismissed all charges in the case and refunded\nthe $1,000 that he had posted for bail. The judge informed him that this would be expunged from\nhis record. Applicant stated that he answered question #21 negatively, because he did not believe he\nhad been charged. I find that Applicant did not knowingly furnish false information to the\nGovernment in his SCA, but believed he was answering the question correctly.\nCurrent Status of Iran\nSince members of Applicant\u2019s family are citizens and residents of Iran, it is relevant to\nexamine the status and the nature of the country. Currently, Iran is considered one of the most\ndangerous adversaries to the interests of the United States. The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations\nwith Iran since April 7, 1980, following the November 1979 Iranian student occupation of the\nAmerican Embassy in Tehran and the hostage taking of 52 Americans, which was supported by\nAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran\u2019s leader at the time.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are not limited\nto the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of mass destruction, (2) its\nsponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into the internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its\naggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and (5) its human rights violation\nagainst its own people. As a result of these concerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\n \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a character letter from an individual, who is a Technical Director for part\nof the Air Force Research Laboratory, and has known the Applicant for more than two years (Exhibit\nB). He knows him in both business and social settings. He indicated that Applicant\u2019s allegiance to\nthe United States is very strong and he would not do anything to compromise the trust that has been\nplaced in him.\nRemand Issue\nAt the hearing, Applicant offered into evidence a one page character letter on his behalf,\ndated March 12, 2007, which was unsigned (Exhibit B). At the request of Applicant\u2019s counsel, the\nrecord was left open, to allow Applicant to submit a copy of the same letter, but with the author\u2019s\nsignature included.\n\n5\nApparently, Applicant\u2019s counsel had not only submitted a copy of the  March 12, 2007 letter,\nnow signed by the author, but he also offered an additional one page letter, dated March 28, 2007,\nby the same author. This was not forwarded to me by Department Counsel.   Both parties want me\nto have the opportunity to consider this letter before issuing my final decision. \n Since the record was only left open for Applicant to submit a signed copy of Exhibit B, the\nMarch 28, 2007 letter, which is a subsequent letter,  is technically not admissible. However, since\nit was not objected to by Department Counsel, I will admit this letter as Exhibit C, and I will\nconsider it in this remand decision.  \nIn his second letter, the Technical Director once again reiterated Applicant\u2019s strong\nattachment to the United States, and he further emphasized that Applicant is \u201can exceedingly\ntrustworthy person\u201d who will protect classified information \u201cas well as or better than any other US\ncitizen\u201d (Exhibit C).\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account\nin reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the\npertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative\ndecision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and\nsurrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which\nthe conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences\ninvolved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\npotential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct\nwill continue or recur in the future. See Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.\nBecause each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be\nassumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in\nevery case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be\nsufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available\ninformation reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or\nemotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to\ngrant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.

In addition, as the\ntrier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.\nDecisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.\n\n6\nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the\nStatement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a\nsecurity concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present\nevidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence\nof criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government\nraise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy\nburden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United\nStates Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \"the clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\" Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the national security. See Enclosure 2 to the Directive,\nSection E2.2.2.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with\nrespect to Guidelines B, C and E:\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,\nincluding cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,\nare not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Based on the evidence of record,\nthe Government has established a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign\ninfluence. As Applicant\u2019s father and mother, with whom he has a close personal relationship, are\ncitizens and residents of Iran, a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the\nUnited States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this family members do not pose\na security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). \nThe Iranian citizenship of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for\nforeign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes\nApplicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties\nraises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation,\nor mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 8, 2001). This, Applicant has not been able to do. \n  The existence of Applicant\u2019s parents and brother, who are citizens and residents of Iran,\n\n7\ncomes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) (a), contact with family members, if that contact creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. Based on\nthe nature and closeness of the relationship of Applicant with his parents, and the great and\ncontinuing threat posed by Iran,  I can not find that any Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply . While\nthe strong letters of support in Exhibits B and C reiterate that Applicant  is a man of integrity and\nloyalty, they do not reduce the very significant security threat posed by Applicant\u2019s family in Iran.\nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on the issue of Foreign Influence, I conclude\nthat the evidence supporting the SOR substantially outweighs any mitigating evidence.\n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \nGuideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States. Applicant\u2019s application for an Iranian passport, while a United States\ncitizen, must be considered adversely to Applicant and it raises serious Foreign Preference\n(Guideline C) concerns. However, his destruction of that passport and the fact that he had never used\nit, considered with his willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship, must be considered positively\nfor Applicant. \nDC (a) (1) and (2) apply because of Applicant possession of his Iranian passport after he\nbecame a United States citizen and his Iranian military service. I find that because of Applicant\u2019s\nstated willingness to renounce his Iranian citizenship, MC (b) applies in this case under Guideline\nC. Also, MC (c) applies because Applicant\u2019s military service occurred before Applicant became a\nU.S. citizen, and MC (e) applies because his Iranian passport, which he never used,  has been\ndestroyed. Applicant has mitigated the Guideline C concerns.\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s there were charges\nagainst Applicant but they were dismissed. However, based on his credible testimony that he\nbelieved since the case was dismissed and he was told it would be expunged from his record, he\nbelieve that the correct answer to question #21 on his SCA was \u201cNo.\u201d \nIn reviewing the DC under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC  applies. I resolve Guideline\nE for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline C: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2. a.: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3. a.: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDavid P. Price, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nIt was alleged Applicant was involved in security violations, falsified and misrepresented\nmaterial facts on his security clearance applications and during interviews. I find there were no\nsecurity violations or intentional falsifications. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or\nextenuate the negative security implications listed in the SOR. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn September 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted\nor continued due to security violation, personal conduct, criminal conduct, and security concerns.\nOn October 18, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On June 18,\n2007, I was assigned the case. On July 5, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing held\non July 25, 2007. On August 3, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 46-years-old, self employed, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Navy until September 2002 when he retired at the grade of E-8 after\n24 years of service. (App Ex E) While in the Navy, Applicant held various security clearances. He\nspent 18 years as an anti-terrorism force protection officer. (Tr. 187) His specialty was as a military\npolice investigator. While in the service he received numerous service and joint service\ncommendation medals, achievement medals, and letters of commendation. (App Ex E)\nCoworkers hold Applicant in the highest regard for his professional and personal skills as\nwell as integrity, strong character, honesty, sincerity, and trustworthiness. Applicant is regarded as\nan ethical, loyal person, and a self-starter who has a strong commitment to his family, country and\nfriends.  Applicant has excellent knowledge of corporate and industrial security policies, procedures\nand programs. He demonstrates professional performance exhibiting traits of morality, honesty, and\ngood character. He is an outstanding security professional and trusted colleague. (App Ex G)\nApplicant also received a letter of appreciation from the FBI related to his work. (App Ex C) \nA coworker in a high tempo environment believes Applicant to be honest and trustworthy.\n(Tr. 121) Another acquaintance to provide testimony was a senior government career security\ncounterintelligence officer and  security manager, responsible for special access programs, who is\nfamiliar with the personnel security process and defense industrial security clearances, and has\nknown Applicant since 2002. (Tr. 128-130, 140) This individual attempted to hire Applicant because\nhe felt \u201cso strongly about him and his talents and his ethical background.\u201d (Tr. 133) This person\nstated Applicant was one of the most ethical and knowledgeable security officers he ever had the\nopportunity to work with. (Tr. 140-141) Applicant has an outstanding reputation among the\nmembers of the professional community (Tr. 142) and is very highly spoken of by those who have\nworked with him. (Tr. 142)\nApplicant worked for a construction company as the facility security officer (FSO). (Tr.\n143). Even though he was the FSO, he was not responsible for personnel security clearance\napplications, adjudications, or investigations. (Tr. 256)  In 2002 or 2003, Applicant was informed\nby a company engineer about a telephone call from an individual believed to be Chinese. An\nindividual left a message on a coworker\u2019s voice mail. Applicant used a recording device to copy the\nmessage and turned it over to the FBI. \nThere was concern the company might have been targeted by a foreign government. At the\ntime, Applicant\u2019s company was participating in a bid proposal on a construction project in China.\n\nCDs are called \u201cflyaways\u201d because once made a person would fly to the subcontractor\u2019s location and the CD\n2\nwould be left at the security office at that location. (Tr. 175-176)\n3\nAfter the company received the contract, numerous individuals, believed to be Chinese, contacted\nthe company wishing to partner with the company on the project. The FBI and the senior\ngovernment career officer previously mentioned investigated the recording. (Tr. 155)\nThe recording occurred outside of secured area. (Tr. 154, 157, 259)  It was later alleged\nApplicant brought a recording device into a secure area for purposes of recording the telephone\nmessage. The company later set up a secured space, but the recording did not take place in that\nspace. (Tr. 154) Applicant changed his job from corporate FSO to a project FSO and turned the\nrecorder and recording over to the corporate FSO. Applicant could not keep the recorder because\nhe was moving to a secure area. (Tr. 155)\nIn October 2004, Applicant, as FSO for the general contractor, wanted to provide the\nsubcontractors uniformity and help on construction projects. (Tr. 190) In July 2004, Applicant\ncopied data onto nine computer disks (CDs), hand carried two of them to subcontractor facilities,\nand placed them into dedicated project space. (Tr. 160) The CDs were to be put into \u201cflyaway \u201d\n2\npackages. The CDs contained non-sensitive templates of information on how to do document\ncontrol, safeguarding records, keeping employees\u2019 clearances current, and other security matters (Tr.\n157,158) When reviewed and approved by the State Department, Applicant\u2019s actions were\napplauded. The CDs greatly aided consistency, operation, and execution. (Tr. 158)\nThe material was unclassified, but the disks were made on a classified system. \u201cMigration\u201d\nis a problem when a classified system is used to make CDs. Although unlikely, some parts of files\nor fragments could inadvertently \u201cmigrate\u201d onto the CDs. (Tr. 159) The CDs were not initially\nmarked secret, but the two were so marked when the mistake was discovered. (Gov Ex 2, 3, Tr. 160)\nThe other seven copies were destroyed and new CDs were made on an unclassified system. (Tr. 160)\nApplicant discussed the creation of the CDs with the senior government employee previously\nreferenced.  Applicant was directed to investigate the incident.  In fact, he was asked to investigate\nhimself.  Gov Ex 3 bears Applicant\u2019s signature. The company made a log entry of the incident, an\nentry made by Applicant. (Gov Ex 3, Tr. 62, 194) An investigator was told by company officials that\nthe State Department would have the incident report. (Tr. 93) The State Department found\nApplicant\u2019s actions were not a security violation. (Tr. 160)\nThe State Department referred to the incident as an \u201cinfraction.\u201d  A security infraction being\nan incident where the rules have not been followed as opposed to a security \u201cviolation\u201d where\ncompromise cannot be ruled out.  Even though improperly marked, the material was hand carried\nand properly safeguarded. (Tr. 161) There was no compromise of information. The subject interview\noutline (Gov Ex 10) question 127 references the storing or safeguarding of \u201cclassified information.\u201d\nThe material on the CDs was unclassified information. \nApplicant was interviewed four times by a special investigator for the Department of State.\n(Tr. 78)  In May 2005, during an interview, Applicant stated he had not had any security violations.\nThe previously described incident had been addressed and resolved by the U.S. Department of State\nand no further action was taken. There was no security violation. (Tr. 194)\n\n4\nAs the FSO, Applicant would often identify deficiencies about the handling of facility\nsecurity issues. (Tr. 96) Applicant was not getting cooperation needed from coworkers. Applicant\nwas not liked by some of his former company\u2019s employees. (Tr. 96) When Applicant discovered\nconstruction problems related to security he was ostracized by his coworkers. His discoveries of\nsecurity problems were not well received because the company was on a fixed price contract and\nevery discovery cost the company money. As FSO Applicant was required to report the incidents\nto the government.  After the third or forth incident report, the company directed Applicant to first\ninform the company of any incident so they could take corrective action before the incidents were\nreported to the government. (Tr. 152)\nApplicant became frustrated about these issues and the company\u2019s demand to screen his\nreports before they went to the government. (Tr. 165)  Applicant was obligated to inform the\ngovernment about the company\u2019s demand to screen his reports and the government talked to the\ncompany. At this time, Applicant was under significant stress and was suffering from back\nproblems. (Tr. 165) Applicant was not sleeping well, he was very on-edge, and stressed. (Tr. 179-\n180) Applicant said he left his company for health reasons.  His stress in performing his job was\nsufficient to leave the company. \nAfter leaving the construction company, Applicant started his own business. (Tr. 218)\nApplicant is a member of several professional and community organizations. (Tr. 218, App Ex B,\nF) In April 2005, as part of his marketing plan for his new company, Applicant sent out emails about\nhis company and his experience to members of a national industrial security professional society.\n(Gov Ex 5, Tr. 219) The emails were sent one month after leaving his previous job. The society\u2019s\npresident told Applicant it was against society\u2019s rules to use the society directory to solicit work or\nfor general advertising purposes. (App Ex B) Since being told about the rule, Applicant has not used\nthe society directory to solicit work.\nIn December 2001, Applicant received a bachelor of science degree in security management\nfrom a college and university. (App Ex D)  It is accredited by the Association for Online Academic\nExcellence, which was established to uphold and maintain high standards for all levels of online post\nsecondary education. (App Ex D) The Applicant was unaware the school was not accredited by the\nDepartment of Education. In June 2002, Applicant completed a security clearance application,\nStandard Form (SF) 86 (Gov Ex 2) and in response to question 5, concerning his education,\nApplicant stated he completed received his bachelor of science degree. He made the same response\non his April 2005 SF 86 (Gov Ex 1) and listed her schools he had attended. The forms do reference\ncorrespondence schools and extension classes, but do not ask if the schools are accredited.\nWhile in the Navy, Applicant attended online and distant learning programs from a variety\nof schools. (App Ex F) In the 1980\u2019s or early 1990\u2019s, Applicant attended extension classes at the\nbase educational building.  The courses were not attended in residence, but as part of a distant\nlearning program.  Fifteen years later, in April 2005, Applicant completed his SF 86. (Gov Ex 2)\nApplicant did not have copies of his college transcripts when he completed his SF 86.  He knew the\ncity where the school was located, but did not have transcripts of his courses. On his SF 86,\nApplicant stated he obtained credits toward a BS degree from a university between 1989 and 1991\nat a city university when in fact the courses were from a city college. (App Ex F, page 7) Applicant\nasserts he did not intentionally misrepresent the name of the school. (Tr. 201)\n\n5\nIn August 2005, Applicant listed his academic credentials on his company\u2019s website. In\nSeptember 2006, Applicant listed his academic credentials on his company\u2019s website as graduating\nwith a bachelor science degree.  He did not state the school was not an accredited institution.  In\nSeptember 2006, he listed his academic credentials on his company web site.  He did not disclose\nthe institution was not accredited on his web site. \nThe Government chose not to put forth evidence on the allegations listed in SOR 2.b, 2. c,\n2.e, 2.f, 2.m, and 2.o. (Tr. 15) These allegations relate to the listing of Applicant\u2019s education on his\nSF 86 and elsewhere.\nShortly after his December 1997 divorce, Applicant met a woman when he was on 30 days\nleave in the U.S.  He was stationed overseas at the time.  Four or five months later, she came to visit\nhim at his overseas location and after three weeks they married prior her returned to the U.S.  A\nmonth later, Applicant received two calls from friends who had seen Applicant\u2019s wife kissing and\ngallivanting with another man. (Tr. 205) Applicant called his wife, confronted her about the\ninformation, stated they had prematurely entered into the marriage, and should get the marriage\nannulled.  The marriage was annulled and Applicant later learned the grounds for the annulment was\nlisted as fraud. Fraud is one of a very limited number of reasons annulment can be granted in his\nstate.  He denies any fraud on his part. (Tr. 206) Applicant has had no further contact with the\nwoman. Applicant believed an annulment declared the marriage null and void, having the effect as\nif the marriage never occurred. (Tr. 261) \nIn response to question 8 on his June 2002 SF 86 and question 13 on his 2005 SF 86,\nApplicant listed his current spouse whom he married in 2000, and a December 1997 divorce to a\nformer spouse whom he had married in 1984.  He did not list his 1998 marriage, which was annulled\nin 1999. He assets he failed to list his annulment because there was no block on his SF 86 for\nannulments.  The form does have a check block for being divorced or widowed but not for an\nannulment. When Applicant was interviewed about his SF 86, he asked about former spouses and\nfailed to disclose this 1998 marriage. (Tr. 68) When asked about the annulment, Applicant stated\nhe thought he had put it on the form. (Tr. 69)\nIn 1979, Applicant\u2014then age 17\u2014had been detained when he was a passenger in a car\ncoming home from a football game.  Alcohol was found in the car.  He was released to his parents.\nHe was unaware the incident resulted in any charges until he received the SOR. In 1984,\nApplicant\u2014then age 22 or 23\u2014 received non judicial punishment (NJP) under Article 15 Uniform\nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) for use of a controlled substance, having tested positive for\nmarijuana. He forfeited $300 per month pay for two months. Following his NJP, he received a\nclearance in 1991 and at other times prior his retiring from the Navy in September 2002. Applicant\nfailed to list the 1979 incident and his 1984 NJP on either of his SF 86s. (Gov Ex 1, 2)\nWhen questioned during an interview about his answers on the SF 86s, Applicant explained\nhis reasoning for his answers and how he interpreted the questions asked. (Tr. 217) Applicant\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to question 23. d on his 2005 SF 86 (Gov Ex 1) which asked if he had every been\ncharged with or convicted on any offense related to alcohol or drugs.  He listed his 1984 DUI in the\nspace provided following question 23. f.  The following question, question 23. e, asked if he had any\ndisciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ, including non judicial punishment, during the previous\nseven years. Applicant stated he thought he did not have to list the 1984 Article 15 because it was\noutside the scope of the question, it having occurred 20 years before the SF 86s was completed.\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n3\n6\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24. a, concerning use of illegal drugs, which asks if\nApplicant had ever used marijuana since age 16 or in the last seven years, which he had not.  His\nuse occurred 20 years prior.\nSimilar questions are asked on Applicant\u2019s 2002 SF 86. (Gov Ex 2) Question 24. asked if\nApplicant was \u201cever\u201d charged with alcohol or drug offenses.  Question 25. related to non judicial\ndisciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ and limits the period in question to the previous seven\nyears. Questions 27 and 29, related to illegal drug use, and question 30, related to alcohol use, limits\nthe period in question to the previous seven years. \nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline K, security violation, Guideline\nE, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.3\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\n\n7\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government asserts two security violations.  A foreign national called an engineer at his\nformer company.  As FSO, Applicant made a copy of the voice mail and gave it to the FBI.  The\nrecording did not take place in a project secure area.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.a. Applicant\nmade nine CDs containing non classified information on a classified computer. This was an\ninfraction, but the State Department states it was not a security violation.  I find for Applicant as to\nSOR 1.b. I find neither the recording of the voice mail and turning it over to the FBI nor the making\nof the CDs to be a security concern.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.b. \nUnder personal conduct the concern is conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nDuring a May 2005 interview, Applicant told the investigator he did not have any security\nviolations. That was true. I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.c. Applicant listed his college and\nuniversity on his two SF-86s and website. The college was not accredited, but the form does not\nrequire an applicant to vouch for his school. Additionally, Applicant was required to list his schools\non his SF-86s and his failure to list them would have been improper. The government chose not to\nintroduce evidence about his listing of this school.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.b, 2.c, 2.e, and\n2.f. \nApplicant attended a distant learning course while in the Navy at an on base location. He\nknew the classes were from a school in a city, but did not have access to his transcript when\ncompleting his SF-86.  The difference between the university attended and the university listed is\nimportant to someone with a greater knowledge of educational institutions. The difference is not so\nobvious to someone with a more limited post high school education. I find this was not an\nintentional falsification.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.d. \nApplicant met a woman while on 30 days leave from the military.  A few months later, she\nvisited him at his over seas location. Before ending her three week vacation, the two married and\nshe returned to the U.S.  Within a month of her return to the U.S., Applicant learned she was not\nfaithful to him.  He talked with her and they agreed on an annulment. The state has limited grounds\nfor annulments. Fraud was the stated reason for the action. After the woman left the overseas\nlocation, Applicant never cohabited with her. After the annulment, Applicant never talked with her\nagain. \n\n8\nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86, he did not list his annulment. He did list his current\nwife and his former wife from whom he was divorced. The SF 86 asks about deceased spouses and\ndivorced spouses, but not about annulments. Since there was no place to list an annulment,\nApplicant did not list it.  Applicant lived with this woman less than two months and talked with her\nfor a few months more.  Their time together as husband and wife was minimal.  It lasted from late\nin her three week visit to Applicant\u2019s overseas location until her departure.  There seems little to be\ngained by Applicant by failing to list this extremely short marriage. Additionally, an annulment\ntreats the marriage as if it never occurred. I find Applicant\u2019s actions not to be an intentional\nfalsification. I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.g, 2.h, and 2.i. \nApplicant was convicted of DUI in 1984.  He listed the offense under his police record when\nhe completed his SF 86s.  Twenty three years before filling out his 2002 SF 86, in 1979, Applicant\nwas returning from a high school football game when the car was stopped.  He was released to his\nparents. Only after the start of the process to deny his clearance did Applicant learn he had been\ncharged with public drunkenness.  An omission concerning his 1979 arrest is not deliberate if the\nperson did not know he had been arrested. \nOn his 2005 SF 86 (Gov Ex 1), in response to question 23.d, Applicant indicated he had been\ncharge with or convicted of an offense related to alcohol or drugs and listed his 1984 DUI.  The\nfollowing question, 25.e, asked him if he had any NJP action within the previous seven years.\nApplicant had received Article 15 punishment following a positive urinalysis for marijuana in 1984.\nApplicant was 22 or 23 years old at the time and the NJP occurred 21 years before the SF 86 was\ncompleted. This was outside the seven year period for NJP. Because it was outside the period,\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the question. Applicant should have listed his 1984 NJP action because\nit was drug related and therefore not limited to the prior seven years. \nOn his 2002 SF 86 (Gov Ex 2) the question about his alcohol and drug offenses and police\nrecord was question 24. and the question about NJP was question 25. Someone not familiar with the\nSF 86 could have the impression an NJP incident was only of concern if it had occurred within the\nprevious seven years. Applicant states he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86s. Following his NJP,\nin 1991, and at times thereafter, while in the Navy, he received security clearances. It is not\nimpossible to believe Applicant did not think the government was concern with an NJP action that\nhad occurred twenty plus years earlier and before additional clearances were granted.  I find for\nApplicant as to 2.j, 2.k, and 2.l.\nWhile employed by the construction company, Applicant was under considerable stress and\nwas having problems sleeping.  The company wanted him to clear reports submit to the government\nthrough the company before they were forwarded to the government.  Each time Applicant\ndiscovered a problem it cost the company money because of the fixed cost nature of the contract.\nSaying he left the company for health reasons was not a falsification. Government offered no\nevidence on SOR 2.m.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.m.\nAfter leaving the company, Applicant opened his own company and solicited business.  He\nwas a member of a professional society and used the society\u2019s email list to contact individuals and\ncompanies. The society president told Applicant the society\u2019s directory was not to be used for\nadvertisement or for soliciting work and Applicant never repeated his mistake.  There is no evidence\nApplicant used information from his previous company to solicit work.  I find for Applicant as to\nSOR 2.n.\n\n9\nSOR 2.alleged Applicant used inappropriate language at the construction company.\nGovernment offered no evidence about inappropriate language.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 2.o.\nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct, the government has shown Applicant\u2019s answers to\nsome of the questions on his two SF 86s were incorrect, but this does not prove the Applicant\ndeliberately failed to disclose information about his education, annulment, NJP, and 1979 arrest. The\nApplicant has denied intentional falsification. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\na material fact in any written document or oral statement to the Government when applying for a\nsecurity clearance is a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A\nfalsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.\nIt is material if it could change the course of the investigation into Applicant's suitability for holding\na clearance. For the reasons previously listed, I find Applicant did not knowingly and willfully\nfalsify his SF 86s or falsify information provided to an investigator. \nParagraph 3 of the SOR alleges Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by deliberately making\na materially false statement on his security clearance application.  For the reasons discussed above,\nI find there was no deliberate falsification of his SF 86 or during interviews. I find no violation of\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 and find for Applicant as to SOR 3. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; An applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct; An applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the\nconduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct\nwill continue or recur in the future. \nCoworkers hold Applicant in the highest regard for his professional and personal skills as\nwell as integrity, strong character, honesty, sincerity, and trustworthiness.  Weight was given to the\ntestimony of the senior government career security counterintelligence officer and security manager\nnot only related to Applicant\u2019s character, but as to whether security violations occurred.  I find no\nsecurity violations, no intentional falsifications, and no criminal conduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Security Violation: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 Personal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.p:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant answered the SOR 141November 2007, and requested a\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 7 January 2008, and I convened a hearing 11\nFebruary 2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 20 February 2008.\n \nMarch 6, 2008\n\nAt hearing, Department Counsel indicated that the government would not pursue allegation 1.a. because\n2\nhis research revealed that the criminal record allegedly falsified involved misdemeanor crimes not required\nto be disclosed. Accordingly, I have stricken allegation 1.a.\nThe document itself states \u201cDATE SUBJECT SIGNED THE FORM: 2004/01/28.\u201d However an EPSQ\n3\nautomatically generates this date when the form is printed, regardless of when the form is actually signed.\n.My conclusions are further confirmed by Applicant\u2019s testimony at hearing that he completed several\n4\nclearance applications during his first year or so with his employer, and thought he had provided updated\ninformation on those applications. Further, Applicant\u2019s sworn statement shows his obvious confusion\nabout why the 2004 trips to Ukraine did not appear on his clearance application.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR paragraph 1 allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate\nhis admissions as findings of fact. He denied the SOR paragraph 2 allegations. He is a\n53-year-old senior principal engineer employed by a defense contractor since\nNovember 2003. He seeks to retain the security clearance he obtained in January 1994.\nApplicant allegedly falsified a January 2005 clearance application (G.E. 1) by\nfailing to disclose that he was living with a foreign national (SOR 1.b.) and failing to\ndisclose three additional trips to Ukraine in 2004 (SOR 1.c.).  He also allegedly falsified\n2\na May 2007 sworn statement (G.E. 2) by claiming that his first trips to Ukraine began in\nFebruary 2004 (SOR 1.c.). G.E. 1 fails to establish the alleged falsifications for the\nsimple reason that it is a composite of two distinct documents, neither of which is\ndemonstrably false. The first six pages of the exhibit is a complete SF 86 (EPSQ\nversion 2.2) whose first page indicates that it was generated  (and possibly signed) 28\n3\nJanuary 2004. On that date, the form accurately reflects Applicant\u2019s two trips to Ukraine\nin 2003, and the foreign national had not yet moved in with him. The first six pages\nincludes a complete signature block which is unsigned. The seventh page of the exhibit\nis a signature page from a different SF 86, that is numbered \u201cPage: 8,\u201d contains different\ninformation than the unsigned signature page numbered \u201cPage: 6,\u201d was signed by\nApplicant on 3 January 2005, and faxed by Applicant\u2019s employer at 0301 on 3 January\n2005, as page 001 of the facsimile. Thus, G.E. 1 consists of six pages of information\nthat was correct in January 2004, but not certified by the Applicant, and the Applicant\u2019s\nJanuary 2005 certification of an eight-page document, the contents of whose  first seven\npages are unknown. Applicant\u2019s sworn statement does not support any finding of\nfalsification, largely because it records a discussion in which both the Applicant and the\ninvestigator were working on the incorrect assumption that G.E. 1 was a complete\ndocument. Consequently, the government\u2019s evidence fails to overcome Applicant\u2019s\ndenial of SOR 1.b. and 1.c.4\n    \nThe government\u2019s allegation that Applicant falsified his May 2007 sworn\nstatement by claiming that his first trips to Ukraine were in 2004 is similarly misguided.\nThe only sensible reading of his sworn statement is as his discussion with the\ninvestigator about the information allegedly omitted by the Applicant on his clearance\napplication, the reasons for the omissions, and providing the missing information.\n\nAt least one of these trips was required by INS to ensure the marriage was legitimate and not a visa scam. The\n5\nNovember 2004 trip was when his fianc\u00e9 immigrated to the U.S.\n3\nApplicant never stated that his first trip \u201cever\u201d to Ukraine was February 2004. Indeed,\nsuch a statement would be silly to an investigator apparently working from G.E. 1, which\nclearly had the 2003 travel.\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen, born, raised, and educated in the U.S. He traveled to\nUkraine in August 2003, October 2003, and February 2004 for pleasure. Later in 2004,\nApplicant, through an internet marriage agency, began corresponding with a Ukrainian\nnational by e-mail and regular mail. In May 2004 and three times between August 2004\nand November 2004, Applicant traveled to Ukraine to visit with this prospective bride\nand her family.  She immigrated to the U.S. in December 2004, and married Applicant in\n5\nFebruary 2005. She went to school in the U.S. and obtained certification as a physical\ntherapy assistant. She has not traveled to Ukraine since immigrating to the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. and intends to become\na U.S. citizen. She has applied for citizenship but is not yet eligible because of\nresidence requirements. Her parents are resident citizens of Ukraine, with no\nconnections to the Ukrainian government. Neither speaks any English, and Applicant\nspeaks neither Ukranian or Russian. Her father manages a bread factory; her mother is\na housewife. Her sister is a resident citizen of Ukraine, with no connections to the\nUkranian government. She also speaks no English. She is a housewife. Applicant has\nlittle direct contact with his in-laws because of this language barrier.\nUkraine has a parliamentary-presidential type of government since its\nindependence from the Soviet Union in 1991, and is undergoing profound political and\neconomic change as it moves toward a market economy and multiparty democracy.\nHowever, Ukraine has significant human rights problems. Torture, arbitrary detention of\npersons critical of the government, and warrantless violations of privacy are illegal but\ncommon. Ukraine has good relations with the U.S., and its primary foreign policy goal is\nEuro-Atlantic integration, including membership in the World Trade Organization, the\nEuropean Union, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ukraine also participates\nin six United Nation peacekeeping missions and has a small number of troops serving in\nsupporting roles with Coalition forces in Iraq. Ukraine has peaceful and constructive\nrelations with its neighbors. Relations with Russia are difficult and complex, however,\ndue to differing foreign policy priorities in the region, energy dependence, payment\narrears, disagreement over stationing of Russian military forces, and some boundary\ndisputes. It is not a known collector of U.S. intelligence information, and is not known to\ntarget its expatriate citizens to obtain information.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n7\n4\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.6\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n7\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n8\n5\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.8\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. Considering first the country involved, Ukraine and the U.S. enjoy good\nforeign relations. It has not been demonstrated that the Ukranian government is actively\nengaged in the collection of U.S. intelligence, or that it targets its expatriate citizens\nsuch that would make Applicant or his in-laws likely targets for coercion, duress, or\ninfluence.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in with his in-laws.\nNone of Applicant\u2019s in-laws have any direct connection to the Ukranian government,\nand Applicant\u2019s contacts with them are so limited that they do not raise a concern over\nprotecting classified information. Under these circumstances, I conclude that it is\nunlikely Applicant can be pressured based on his in-laws in Ukraine. Accordingly, I\nresolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nThe government failed to prove its falsification case under Guideline E. The\nallegations covered by Guideline E were unsubstantiated. Accordingly, I resolve\nGuideline E for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\n   Paragraph 1.

Specifically,\nhe has a history of being unable to pay his debts and thereafter failing to take reasonable steps to\nsatisfy his creditors. He has delinquent debt totaling $41,385.42. Applicant has not set up adequate\nplans to resolve his delinquencies, although he initially consulted his creditors. Applicant failed to\nprovide accurate answers regarding his delinquent debts on his security clearance application.\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties, or his\nfalsification of material matters on his security clearance application. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn June 7, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended\nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn, written statement, received on July 31, 2006, Applicant responded to the\nallegations in the SOR. He elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s case on April 26, 2007.  Department\n1\nCounsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant, along with\nhis notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on May 15, 2007. On June 5, 2007,\nApplicant submitted additional materials in response to the SOR, without an objection. The case was\nassigned to me on June 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted factual allegations of subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f. of the SOR under\nGuideline F.  Applicant admitted factual allegations of subparagraph 2.a. through 2.c. under\n2\nGuideline E. He denied factual allegation 1.g. because he disputes this debt. The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.\n\nItem 5 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86) dated January 27, 2005 ), at 1-9.\n3\nId. at 4.\n4\nItem 4 (Public Trust Application (SF 85P), dated July 13, 2004.\n5\nItem 2, supra at note 2.\n6\nId.\n7\nItem 13 at 1-2.\n8\n3\nApplicant, a 44-year-old, employed with a defense contractor, seeks to obtain a security\nclearance.  He graduated from high school in 1982 and then served in the United States Marine\n3\nCorps (USMC) from 1982 until 1993 when he was medically discharged due to a training accident.\nApplicant was an aviation instructor. He received his Master\u2019s Degree in 2004, and is currently in\na Ph.D. program. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2003.  He is now remarried with one child.\n4\nHe completed a public trust application on July 13, 2004, and a security clearance application on\nJanuary 27, 2005.5\nApplicant was gainfully employed within the civil aviation field for many years.  In 2001\nafter September 11, his employer began lay offs and salary reductions. At first, Applicant\u2019s salary\nwas reduced which caused some financial hardship.  Shortly after that, his wife decided to file for\ndivorce. He had one income. This made covering the marital debts impossible.6\nIn March 2002, Applicant\u2019s salary was again reduced. By April there was another round of\nreductions.  He then lost his job. When Applicant became unemployed, he contacted his creditors\nand told  them he would not be able to pay all his debts due to his financial problems. He asked them\nto work with him. Up until then his credit was fine. Some did work with him, but others turned the\naccounts over to a collection agency. At this point his credit rating fell.7\nIn August 2002, Applicant accepted employment with a new company in another state. He\nhad fallen behind in his mortgage payments on his home and when he relocated he decided he would\nsell the house. Unfortunately, the house did not sell. He lost the home to foreclosure in 2003. Since\nhe could not afford both a house and a new place to live, his debt increased.\nThe debt in allegation 1.a is not in dispute. Applicant opened the credit card account and was\ncurrent until 2002. He notified the company, but the account was turned over to a collection agency.\nApplicant believes the amount owed is approximately $900. He has not heard from the collection\nagency, but stands ready to pay the unpaid balance in full.8\nApplicant has two judgments (allegation 1.b and 1.f). A judgment in the amount of\n$22,079.84 was entered in 2003 (1.f.). This was a second mortgage. He made payments until 2002.\nWhen the house was foreclosed, a judgment was entered in October 2003. Applicant maintains that\nhe did not know about the judgment until 2004 when he looked at his credit report. He is awaiting\ncontact from the collection agency to pay this amount. The judgment in allegation 1.b. in the amount\nof $4,130.95 was entered in 2002.  Applicant states he will pay it when he is contacted. He also\nstates he is unaware of the nature of the judgment.\n\nItem 9 (Applicant\u2019s Affidavit, dated May 27, 2005) at 1-9.\n9\nItem 13 (Response to Interrogatories, dated April 18, 2006) at 1-7.\n10\nItem 12 (Personal Financial Statement of Applicant, dated May 27, 2005).\n11\nLetter from Applicant in response to FORM, dated June 2007.\n12\nId. at 1.\n13\n4\nAs to the debts in allegations 1.c, 1.d., and 1.e, Applicant does not recognize the account\nnumbers and believes some of them may be the same accounts sold to various collection agencies.\nIn his 2005, affidavit, he received an offer for settlement for the debt in 1.e., and stated he would\naccept the offer.  In a 2006 statement, he stated that the accounts remain.\n9\n10\nIn August 2004, Applicant wrote a second letter disputing the debt in the SOR 1.g. in the\namount of $452. He denies opening this account.  As to the debts in allegation 1.c. and 1.d., he does\nnot recognize the accounts and believes some of them may be the same accounts sold to various\ncollection agencies.   \nApplicant and his current spouse together have a total net monthly income of $5,852. The\nPersonal Financial Statement prepared by Applicant in May 2005 shows a net remainder, after\nmonthly expenses, of $1,334. He is current on his mortgage and other credit card payments.\nApplicant listed assets worth $255,000, a bank savings account and stocks and bonds.  Although\n11\nhe is paying on his current obligations, he has not consolidated the debts listed in the SOR with a\nrepayment schedule. A savings account of approximately $20,000 helped to pay for his current\nwife\u2019s student loan for her undergraduate degree and his student loan for his Ph.D. program.12\nOn July 13, 2004, Applicant signed a Public Trust Application Form (SF 85P). In response\nto question 22 b. Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? He\nanswered \u201cno.\u201d   Applicant completed his security clearance application (SF 86) on January 27,\n2005. He answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 38: In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent\non any debts and question 39: Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s). Applicant\nprovided incorrect answers on his SF 85P to question 22 b., and on his SF 86 to both questions 38\nand 39. Applicant admitted allegations 2.a., 2.b., and 2c. in his answer to the SOR, with the\nexplanation that he believed that it was appropriate to answer \u201cno\u201d because he had not received any\ncontact from collection agencies or creditors. At the time he completed the two forms, he also stated\nhe did not know about a judgment until much later in time after the 2004 SF 85P application.\nHowever, in the 2004 application he responded \u201cyes\u201d to question 22 a. about a 2003 judgment. In\nhis most recent response to the FORM, he stated that he answered the questions in the 2004 and\n2005 applications in the negative because he was not delinquent on current obligations.13\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in the\nevaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\nor revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions)\n\nICR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at page 2.\n14\nICR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Para E3.1.15.\n15\n5\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information (Mitigating Conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules\nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied\nin conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section\nE.2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair\nand impartial common sense decisions. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d all available, reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a\nmeaningful decision.\nThe Adjudicative Process factors to consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;\n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Protecting\nnational security is the paramount concern in reaching a decision in any case, and is dependent upon\nthe primary standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly consistent with the interest of\nnational security. \nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguidelines pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F - Financial Consideration: An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation. \nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon\n14\nthe applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to\novercome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance.15\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Para. E2.2.2\n16\n6\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Any\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of national security.16\nOne additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism\nare not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 10865 specifically provides\nthat industrial security clearance decisions shall be, \u201c in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned\u201d.Security clearance decisions\ncover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in\nthis decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any\nexpress or implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\n  \nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth\nin the SOR:\nApplicant does not deny his long history of debts and inability to pay since 2001. As\nindicated above, Applicant has a history of financial difficulty. Specifically, his answers to the SOR\nprovide information on debts that resulted from his salary reductions and unemployment after\nSeptember 2001. His overall financial activity and subsequent inactivity give rise to Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6E2.A6.1.2.1. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) and \u00b6E2.A6.1.2.3. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nA security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated in several ways. Applicant\u2019s\ndebt problems have been ongoing for a number of years, and are not recent. Thus, he has not\nestablished a mitigating condition under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC)\nE2.A6.1.3.1 (the behavior was not recent). Since there are multiple debts, FC MC \u00b6E2.A6.1.3.2 (it\nwas an isolated incident) does not apply.\nApplicant submits that his divorce  and unemployment in 2002 caused the financial difficulty.\nThe fact that Applicant did nothing to resolve any of these accounts for so many years following his\ndivorce deprives him of application of (FC MC) \u00b6E2.A6.1.3.3 ( the conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation). Applicant maintains that it is his\nintention to pay all his bills. However, a significant amount of delinquent debt remains outstanding\nand has been  for several years, according to Applicant\u2019s credit report. Although Applicant stated he\nintends to pay all his debts, he has not done so. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient.\n\n7\nApplicant has not received financial counseling, and there is no evidence that Applicant has\nresolved any of his debts in the SOR. Thus, FC MC \u00b6 E2.A6.1.3.4. (The person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) does not apply. Applicant has not provided documentation to support\nhis contention that some of the debts are in fact duplicates.\nApplicant contacted his creditors in 2001 and asked that they work with him to resolve the\ndebt. He also contested one debt. However, since then he has made no effort to pay. Instead he\nmaintains his good intentions but is waiting for collection agencies to contact him. FC MC\n\u00b6E2.A6.1.3.6 (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) does not apply in this case.\nUnder these circumstances, I find insufficient evidence of timely or positive action on\nApplicant\u2019s part to pay off  his outstanding debts. Instead, I find unexplained delays in addressing\nhis outstanding financial obligations and no clear plan to avoid future financial problems. I find\nApplicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. Accordingly, allegations 1.a.\nthrough 1.g of the SOR are concluded against Applicant. \nPersonal Conduct\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central\nquestion if a person\u2019s past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly\nsafeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact\nin any written document or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance\nor in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.\nIt is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood\nthe question, or thought that the time period did not apply.\nApplicant did not disclose his financial problems concerning delinquent debts in the SF 85P,\nhe submitted in 2004 by answering \u201cno\u201d to question 22 b. He did list the judgment against him in\nthat same  application in response to question 22 a. Applicant maintained that he did not list any\ndelinquent debts or judgments  in Questions 38 and 39 in his 2005 security clearance application\nbecause he did not become aware of the judgment until after the initial filing of the SF 86.  Applicant\nhas a long history of debt and history of financial difficulties. He admits to the factual allegation\nregarding falsification of material facts but then declared it was an oversight. The questions are\nclearly worded. His inconsistency in his answers coupled with his admissions do not persuade me\nthat he misunderstood the questions. \n            Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the Government established its case under\nGuideline E. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.   I find, that Applicant\ndeliberately omitted information about his finances in response to questions 22 b., 38,  and 39 on the\nsecurity clearance applications. Therefore, subparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c are decided against the\n\n8\nApplicant. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2. (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award responsibilities.\u201d) applies in\nhis case.\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the alleged debts except for allegation 1.g.\nApplicant was required to list any debts more than 180 or  90 days late on his security applications.\nHe did not, and so, the issue is whether his negative answers to the questions were deliberately false.\nI am persuaded it was. Applicant has had a long history of debts. He did list one judgment. I do not\nfind it reasonable that the other debts would be forgotten as an oversight. \nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nI have considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. He\nis a mature individual who has served in the USMC. He is highly educated and enjoys his work. His\nunemployment and divorce in 2001 contributed to his financial difficulties. While Appliant was\nunable to pay his debts initially, he now has resources to begin a payment plan. He has promised to\npay all his debts, but they remain unpaid. This is not a question of his loyalty to the United States,\nbut his resolve to pay his financial responsibilities. The ultimate burden of persuasion rests with\nApplicant to demonstrate evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation to overcome the\nGovernment\u2019s case against him. Unpaid debts  have security significance under Guideline F and E.\nIn addition, Applicant was not forthcoming in his two applications in 2004 and 2005. This creates\ndoubt and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the Government in security clearance cases.\nTo conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I have considered the record evidence as a\nwhole, the whole person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and\nguidelines in the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn accordance with Section E.2.2. of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, the following are the\nformal findings as to each allegation in the SOR:\n\n9\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations (Guideline F):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct (Guideline E):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has held her current position since November 2002, but was unemployed from July 2002 to October 2002. Her previous employment lasted from May 1999 until June 2002, before which she was also unemployed for three months. An earlier job lasted from September 1996 until December 1998. She has been married since January 1990.3 Since 1999, her periods of unemployment caused her to fall behind on several credit cards and other personal credit accounts. Some of the accounts she used to cover expenses while she had no or reduced income. Others were opened for other discretionary purposes, and fell delinquent during her unemployment. In August 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for a Public Trust Position. She disclosed therein she had three credit cards overdue from 2002. The ensuing background investigation showed she actually owed at least $17,000 for nine different accounts. In April 2006, she responded to DOHA interrogatories about the current status of her debts and any actions she had yet taken to pay or otherwise resolve her obligations.

Eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is\ndenied.\n\n Per Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Counter Intelligence and Security memorandum, Adjudication of\n1\nTrustworthiness Cases, (November 19, 2004), ADP I/II/III cases are resolved through application of DoD Directive\n5220.6 (Directive).\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Item 4, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated August 20, 2004.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a position of public trust.  On August 14, 2006, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\n1\nto grant Applicant eligibility for access to a sensitive position. On August 14, 2006, DOHA issued\nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),  which specified the basis for its decision \u2013  security\n2\nconcerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (financial considerations). On August 30,\n2006, Applicant answered the SOR, admitted all of the SOR allegations, and requested a\ndetermination without a hearing.\nDOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) in support of the\ngovernment\u2019s preliminary decision, a copy of which Applicant received on October 17, 2006.\nApplicant timely submitted additional information in response to the FORM, and the case was\nassigned to me on December 1, 2006.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s aforementioned admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has held her current position\nsince November 2002, but was unemployed from July 2002 to October 2002. Her previous\nemployment lasted from May 1999 until June 2002, before which she was also unemployed for three\nmonths. An earlier job lasted from September 1996 until December 1998. She has been married\nsince January 1990.3\nSince 1999, her periods of unemployment caused her to fall behind on several credit cards\nand other personal credit accounts. Some of the accounts she used to cover expenses while she had\nno or reduced income. Others were opened for other discretionary purposes, and fell delinquent\nduring her unemployment. \nIn August 2004, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for a Public Trust Position. She\ndisclosed therein she had three credit cards overdue from 2002. The ensuing background\ninvestigation showed she actually owed at least $17,000 for nine different accounts. In April 2006,\nshe responded to DOHA interrogatories about the current status of her debts and any actions she had\nyet taken to pay or otherwise resolve her obligations. Applicant verified the debts listed and\nconfirmed she had not taken any steps to pay them.\n\n Directive, Enclosure 2.\n4\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are as follows:\n5\n1. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.\n2. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n3. Age of the applicant.\n4. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, \nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved.\n 5. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\n 6. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future;\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n4\nThe only action Applicant has taken to satisfy her debts was to pay, in response to the FORM\nin October 2006, three of her past due debts. She still has six accounts totaling about $16,100, that\nhave been delinquent since 1999 or 2000. According to a personal financial statement she submitted\nwhen interviewed about her finances by a government investigator in March 2005, Applicant and\nher husband have over $1,000 remaining each month after paying expenses.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\n4\nsuitability for access to sensitive information. Trustworthiness determinations must reflect\nconsideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue\napplicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and\nimpartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.  The\n5\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion\nfor or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof a position of trust.\nThis decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest6\nfor an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to sensitive information. The government\nbears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based its preliminary\ndecision against the applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to such access, an\napplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to sensitive information\n7\nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\n\n See Egan; Directive E2.2.2.\n8\n Directive, E2.A6.1.1.\n9\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;\n10\n Directive, E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n11\n Directive, E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control\n12\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation); \n5\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations. The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified\nbecause she is delinquent on nine personal credit accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i) totaling more than\n$17,000, and that she has more than $400 available each month after expenses (SOR 1.j). In addition\nto Applicant\u2019s admissions to each of the SOR allegations, the government presented sufficient\ninformation to support those allegations. The facts established raise security concerns addressed in\nthe Directive under Guideline F. Specifically, an applicant who is financially overextended through\ndelinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in illegal acts\nto generate funds to resolve their fiscal difficulties.  It is clear from these facts that Applicant is\n9\nunwilling to pay the delinquent debts she accrued almost seven years ago, despite having been\ngainfully employed for the past four years. Accordingly, these facts further support application of\nGuideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1  and DC 3.  \n10\n11\nOf the mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to these facts, only MC 312\nwarrants consideration. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment contributed to her debts and ability\nto pay; however, she has been steadily employed with a positive net cash flow since 2002. Despite\nthis, she has failed to address her past debts in a way that would show she is managing her finances\nresponsibly. Failure to do so is also indicative of poor judgment and reliability. Based on available\ninformation about Applicant\u2019s finances, I conclude this guideline against the Applicant. \nI have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a fair and commonsense\nassessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. This record raises\nreasonable doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect sensitive information and to exercise the\nrequisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its\ninterests. Doubts persist about Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Absent substantial information\nto mitigate these doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I conclude she has not overcome the\ngovernment\u2019s case.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to sensitive information.

Applicant did not\nmeet his burden to overcome foreign influence security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on May 3, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor. On June 14, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence), why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for\nApplicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated July 10, 2006,\nadmitting the truth of all of the factual allegations but denying that any of them made him vulnerable\nto coercion, exploitation or pressure, and elected to have his case decided on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on January 18, 2007.\n1\nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and he was\n2\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation. Applicant responded to the FORM on February 23, 2007, providing additional\nexplanation about his situation and a copy of a letter of recommendation, from a military intelligence\nstaff sergeant, dated November 1, 2005. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT             \nApplicant admitted the truth of every factual allegation set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nforeign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e), but denied that any of them\nmade him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.

After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor, hired to work as a translator\n\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application (SF-86), dated May  3, 2005) at 1, 9.

He was born\n3\nand educated in Iraq, lived as a refugee in Jordan from 1995 until he immigrated in 1998, and\nbecame a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2004.  Applicant reported on his SF-86 and his\n4\nCounterintelligence Screening Questionnaire (CISQ), and admitted in response to the SOR, that his\nmother, one brother, three sisters, one half-brother and half-sister are citizens and residents of Iraq;\nthat his other brother is an Iraqi citizen living in the United States; and that his other sister and other\nhalf-brother are naturalized U.S. citizens and residents.   Applicant also reported and admitted that\n5\nhis roommate in the U.S., at the time he was hired to work in Iraq, was an Iraqi citizen.  Applicant\n6\nworked as a crew leader for a public relations/advertising company for the seven years preceding his\ncurrent employment. He visited his family in Iraq from February to April 2005, and obtained his\ncurrent job in May 2005.7\nWhile living in the U.S., Applicant reported contact with his family members in Iraq twice\nper month, and with family members in the U.S. four times per month.  None of Applicant\u2019s family\n8\nmembers has any employment or other official connection with the government of Iraq.  Since he\n9\nwas hired to work with U.S. forces as a translator in Iraq, he says he has severed all contact with his\nfamily in Iraq, and requested that his relatives in the U.S. not tell his family in Iraq that he is there.\nHe says he does this for his safety and that of his family. In his response to the SOR, he explained:\nI deny that I am vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure due to these [Iraq-\nresident] family contacts. They do not know that I am working in Iraq as linguist. I\ndidn\u2019t tell them because I am looking out for their safety, my safety and the countries\n[sic] safety. I always warn my brothers and my sister back in the states [sic] not to say\nanything about my current job to my family in Iraq. . . . I have not contacted my\nfamily members in Iraq since I\u2019ve been working here. . . . my brother in the United\nStates knows that I am working in Iraq, but does not know what I do. . . . I told my\nbrothers and my sister in United States that if any one asked about me, even my\nmother, my brother or my sisters in Iraq, just tell them that I am very busy and have\nno time to call any one. . . . My former roommate does know that I am in Iraq, but\ndoes not know what I do here. . . . My family in Iraq is not vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or pressure, due to my living and working arrangement because they do\n\nItem 3 at 1-2.\n10\nItem 7 at 1.\n11\nItems 8 through 14.\n12\n4\nnot know I am here.  \n10\nIn his February 23, 2007, response to the FORM, Applicant restated that he had not had any\ncommunication with his family at all since he began his employment there.\nApplicant has been working in Iraq since May 2005.  In his FORM response, he states that\nhe has \u201cbeen working along side many other US Citizens as well as military personnel. These\nindividuals have found me to be very trusting and have placed a great deal of confidence in me.\u201d A\nmilitary intelligence staff sergeant with whom he worked wrote him a letter of recommendation in\nNovember 2005, describing him as an extremely talented team player, with vast knowledge,\nexceptional communication skills, dedication and a positive \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude. The senior\ninvestigator who conducted Applicant\u2019s counterintelligence screening in May 2005 stated that no\nevidence indicated Applicant was a potential security risk, and that he did not appear to present a\nCI/FP risk.  \n11\nDepartment Counsel sought administrative notice of the material facts concerning Iraq set\nforth in part IV of the FORM, and provided seven official U.S. Government source documents\nsupporting the truth of those facts.  Applicant made no objection, and I did take administrative\n12\nnotice of those facts in reaching my decision in this case. Among the most pertinent of these facts\nare that Iraq\u2019s newly and freely elected government has been unable to quell violence that has\nengulfed parts of Iraq, fueled and perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists, Sunni insurgents and Shiite\nmilitias and death squads. Numerous attacks and kidnappings by these groups have targeted\ncontractors and other non-combatants, and various human rights abuses have been substantiated.\nAnti-western terrorist activity in Iaq is a continuing threat to Americans, and others. \nPOLICIES            \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise security\nconcerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns. Applicable\nDCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant, continue, deny or revoke an\nindividual's eligibility for access to classified information.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive (Enclosure 2, Section E2.2), to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and\nimpartial, common sense decisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\n\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.2, E2.2.3.\n13\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n14\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n17\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n13\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n14\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n15\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n16\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n17\nA person who seeks access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.A2.1.1.\n18\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr 6, 2007).\n19\n6\nto whom it grants access to classified information. \nDecisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than\nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\nprovides that any adverse industrial security clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nNothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in\npart, on any express or implied judgment as to Applicant's loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS           \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)            \n\u201cA security risk may exist when and individual\u2019s immediate family, including cohabitants,\nand other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not\ncitizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with\ncitizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security\ndeterminations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure.\u201d18\nSeven of Applicant\u2019s ten immediate family members are both citizens and residents of Iraq,\nand an eighth is an Iraqi citizen residing in the U.S. These circumstances could raise security\nconcerns under foreign influence disqualifying condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (\u201cAn immediate\nfamily member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a\ncitizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country\u201d). The risk of coercion, exploitation or pressure\nfrom the government of Iraq itself may be insignificant, since Applicant and the U.S. forces to whom\nhe provides support are in Iraq in alliance with, and to further the interests of that government.\nAccordingly, the Iraqi citizenship, in and of itself, of his brother who resides in the U.S. does not\nraise any security concerns under this (or any) FI DC. However, there are many violent, warring,\norganized groups operating contrary to the interests of U.S. forces in Iraq that present a heightened\nrisk to act against Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq if his activities and their relationship becomes\nknown. Applicant recognizes and addresses this risk through his decision to have no contact with\nhis family in Iraq, and his attempts to prevent them from knowing where he is and what he is doing.\nThe issue is whether Applicant\u2019s family are in a position to be exploited by anti-U.S. forces in Iraq\nin a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and loyalty to the United\nStates,  not whether the family members realize such risk exists. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close\n19\nfamily members in Iraq raise security concerns under FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1. \n\n7\nApplicant no longer lives with his former roommate, who remains in the U.S., so no security\nconcerns are raised under FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2 (\u201cSharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists\u201d).\nDepartment Counsel did not assert that any other FI DC applied, nor are any supported by the\nevidence.\nApplicant essentially asserted that foreign influence mitigating condition (FI MC)\nE2.A2.1.3.1 (\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question are not agents\nof a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the\nindividual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States\u201d) applies to his\ncircumstances. However, this FI MC requires Applicant to prove both that his family members are\nnot agents of a foreign power, which he has done, and that his family members are not in a position\nto be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to family\nor country. His assertion that this second condition applies because he did not tell them he is in Iraq\nis not persuasive. Deceiving his family members in no way reduces their vulnerability to exploitation\nby anti-U.S. forces active in Iraq, who may be expected to actively seek to identify Applicant as an\nIraqi with close family in the country. As noted, Applicant himself identifies this danger as his\nreason for deceiving his mother and siblings. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he has not had contact with his family members in Iraq since he\nbegan working there in 2005 is also insufficient to mitigate security concerns by application of FI\nMC E2.A2.1.3.3 (\u201cContact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent\u201d).\nApplicant has regular contact with Iraqi citizens in his daily work as a translator for U.S. forces. His\nnon-contact with his family, with whom he previously had frequent contact, was motivated by his\nongoing and natural concern for the threat to their well-being arising from his work on behalf of U.S.\nforces in Iraq. This is not an indication that his susceptibility to pressure, coercion or duress through\nthreats or harm to his family is reduced, but in fact shows the opposite.\nThere is no evidence in the record that would support the application of any other FI MC.\nI have reviewed each potential FI MC and conclude that none apply. \nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six of his nine siblings are both citizens and residents of Iraq. He\ncares for them and their welfare. He even cut off his previously frequent contact with them, to\nprevent their knowing of his work on behalf of U.S. forces in Iraq because of the danger to which\nthis work exposes them. The security concern is not whether his family knows what he is doing, but\nthe risk to them, and through them to Applicant, if anti-U.S. factions find out that he has family in\nIraq who are in a position to be exploited. Applicant left Iraq as a refugee persecuted by the former\nregime, and became a U.S. citizen who has risked his personal safety by serving with U.S. forces as\na contract translator in Iraq since May 2005. His work in this regard has been excellent. However,\non balance, he has not met his burden to show that security concerns raised by the presence of his\nclose family members in an area of active and violent anti-U.S. hostilities is mitigated, or that the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is lessened simply because he deceived those\nfamily members about his activities. This deception, in fact, demonstrates that Applicant recognizes\nthis danger to his family, and his real risk of having to choose between their interests and those of\nthe United States should hostile forces identify them. The risk is a continuing one, inherent in the\nongoing family relationship and the nature of the conflict in Iraq.\n\n8\nAs noted above, any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent\nwith national security must be resolved in favor of the national security. For the reasons stated, I\nconclude Applicant has not demonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national\nsecurity to grant him access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

MALONE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, who was born in India, is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He maintains contact with\n\n2\nhis parents and two close friends, all citizens of and residing in India. He mitigated the security\nconcerns about his possession of a foreign passport after acquiring U.S. citizenship. Available\ninformation also is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s ties to family and\nfriends in India. Clearance is granted. \n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n The Adjudicative Guidelines in Directive, Enclosure 2, have been superceded by the Revised Adjudicative\n2\nGuidelines, which were approved by the President on December 29, 2005,and implemented by the Department of\nDefense on September 1, 2006. Pending formal revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede\nthe guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. However, they apply only to adjudications or trustworthiness\ndeterminations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. The SOR in this case must be adjudicated\nusing the old guidelines.\n The FORM included 16 documents (Items 1 - 16) proffered in support of the government\u2019s case. Because\n3\nDepartment Counsel did not state the basis for their inclusion in the record, I can only assume that Items 8 - 16 were\nsubmitted for Official Notice. I considered the facts to which Department Counsel referred in the FORM that are based\non Items 8 - 16; however, I did not limit myself to Department Counsel\u2019s proffers and considered other information in\nthose documents that I deemed relevant to my decision.\n FORM, Item 1.\n4\n FORM, Item 2.\n5\n FORM, Item 7.\n6\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance. On May 26, 2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR),  which specified the basis for its decision \u2013  security concerns addressed in the Directive\n1\nunder Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline C (foreign preference).  On June 12, 2006,\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR, and requested a determination without a hearing. On July 17, 2006,\nand on January 2, 2007, he submitted additional information in response to the SOR.\nOn February 28, 2007, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials\n(FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision, a copy of which Applicant received\n3\non March 28, 2007. Applicant was afforded 30 days in which to file a response to the FORM, but\nhe submitted nothing before the April 12, 2007, deadline. On August 22, 2007, he submitted\ninformation updating his employment status, and indicating he had nothing else to submit in\nresponse to the government\u2019s case. The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe government alleged that Applicant possessed a passport issued by the Republic of India\non April 1, 1997, which was valid through March 31, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens of and reside in India (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and that he has two friends who\nare citizens of and reside in India (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  In response, Applicant admitted each of the SOR\n4\nallegations.  His admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a review of the pleadings and all\n5\nof the information submitted by the parties, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 43 years old. He was born in India and educated there through college,  but\n6\nstudied at a university in the United States between 1992 and 1994 for his MBA, and took advanced\n\n FORM, Item 5.\n7\n Id.\n8\n FORM, Item 3.\n9\n FORM, Item 7.\n10\n FORM Items 2, 4, 7.\n11\n4\nengineering courses at the same university from 1998 to 1999. It is unclear from the record when he\nfirst came to the United States, but he has lived and worked here continuously since at least February\n1992, when he was 27 years old.  At the time he submitted his current application for clearance, he\n7\nhad been working for a defense contractor for five years as a senior business development manager.\nIn May 2007, he began working for his current employer, also a defense contractor, as the director\nof new product and market development. In August 2002, Applicant was granted a public trust\nposition for work on a contract with the Federal Aviation Administration.\nApplicant married his wife in May 2003. She was born in India, but became a naturalized\ncitizen in 1990. His wife\u2019s earlier marriage produced two children born and raised in the United\nStates, but ended when her previous husband was killed in a car accident. His wife has a sister, who\nlives in and is a naturalized citizen of the United States, and she has extended family (her parents\nare deceased) still in India, with whom Applicant has no contact. Applicant intends to adopt both of\nhis wife\u2019s children.8\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on April 17, 2002. His Indian citizenship ended\nat that time, because India does not recognize dual citizenship. He was issued a U.S. passport on\nApril 30, 2002. In March 1997, he renewed his Indian passport, which would have expired in March\n2007. However, on June 16, 2006, India cancelled Applicant\u2019s passport at his request and he has\nsince relinquished it.  \n9\nApplicant is an only child. His parents are citizens of and reside in India. His mother did not\nwork outside the home when he was growing up, and his father is now retired from an engineering\ncareer. They have never been employed by or connected to the government of India, do not receive\nany government pensions or national healthcare as they are financially independent. Applicant has\nreturned to India several times to visit his parents, and, as of January 2007, was anticipating a visit\nto the U.S. by his parents in the next year.\nApplicant has no financial interests of his own in India. He has no bank accounts, property\ninterests, or investments there. As their only child, his parents have named him the beneficiary on\ntheir joint bank accounts. He also would be the legal heir to their estate.10\nApplicant and his wife have two close friends, a married couple, with whom they keep in\ntouch by telephone or e-mail on a regular basis, and who they see whenever they visit India. The\nhusband is a retired stock broker, and the wife is retired from a job with the United States Agency\nfor International Development at the U.S. Embassy in India. These friends visited him and his wife\nin the U.S. in 2005.11\n\n FORM, Items 9 and 10.\n12\n FORM, Items 11and 13.\n13\n FORM, Item 9.\n14\n FORM, Item 15.\n15\n5\nIndia and the U.S. have had close relations ever since India obtained its independence from\nGreat Britain in 1947. The two governments continue to work closely in pursuit of mutual interests\nin such issues as international management of  nuclear technology, preventing the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons, and the global war on terror. Because India is important to strategic U.S. interests\nin the region, the two countries have also engaged in several joint military exercises to ensure\nstability in southern and southwest Asia. The Indian government buys most of its nuclear technology\nfrom the U.S., and it has an excellent record when it comes to protecting its nuclear arsenal. \nSince the end of the Cold War, India has been an advocate of issues important to non-aligned\nnations, and is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Not\nonly does India enjoy close relations with the U.S., but it is working to strengthen its ties and\nadvance its mutual interests with France, Israel, China, Iran, the European Union, Japan, and the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).12\nIndia\u2019s human rights record in 2006 was often uneven. Throughout its history, India\u2019s caste\nsystem, multi-cultural and multi-ethnic population, and the vestiges of colonial domination have\nchallenged India\u2019s ability to govern certain parts of the country. As a result of sometimes violent\nseparatist movements, provincial law enforcement authorities and military militias have used\nexcessive force to maintain order and defeat domestic terrorism. Terrorism and separatist activities\nare generally done in furtherance of internal issues, and are most violent in limited and remote\ngeographic regions. Despite these problems, India is still an open society in which the rule of law\nis prominent.13\nIndia, the world\u2019s most populous democracy, uses a federal form of government, similar to\nthe United States, but with more authority vested in the central government. It has a bicameral\nlegislature modeled after Britain\u2019s parliament, and its members are selected through open elections\ninvolving several political parties. India also has an active market-oriented economy, and conducts\nmost of its international trade with the U.S.  India is included, along with other countries with whom\n14\nthe U.S. has good relations, on the U.S. State Department\u2019s list of the most active collectors of\nindustrial information and technology.15\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n16\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n17\n See Egan; see also Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n18\n Enclosure 2.\n19\n Directive, 6.3.\n20\n \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\n21\nconsidered in reaching a determination. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should\nconsider the following factors: (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's\nage and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n6\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n16\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor an applicant to have access to classified information. The applicant must then present sufficient\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a\nsecurity clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion to comply with the government\u2019s\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own.  The \u201cclearly\n17\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.18\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines  for consideration when evaluating an\n19\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance decisions must reflect\nconsideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under each adjudicative guideline as\nmay be applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration  of the factors comprising the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d\n20\nand listed in E2.2.1 of the Directive.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating\n21\ncondition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific\napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Having\nconsidered the pleadings and the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative\nguidelines to be applied here are Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline C (foreign\npreference).\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Directive, E2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\n22\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. \n Directive, E2.A3.1.2.1. The exercise of dual citizenship; E2.A3.1.2.2. Possession and/or use of a foreign\n23\npassport;\n Directive, E2.A2.1.1.\n24\n Directive, E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of\n25\naffection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.\n Directive, E2.A2.1.3.5. Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's\n26\nsecurity responsibilities.\n  Directive, E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,\n27\ndaughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to\nbe exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s)\n7\nForeign Preference. The government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a security concerns under\nGuideline C  stemming from Applicant\u2019s possession of a passport issued by the government of India\n22\non April 1, 1997, which was valid for 10 years. Such circumstances require consideration of DC 1\nand DC 3.  Based on the information Applicant submitted in response to the SOR on July 17, 2006,\n23\nDepartment Counsel acknowledged the absence of information showing the passport was used after\nApplicant became a U.S. citizen, and that the foreign passport was cancelled and relinquished.\nAdditionally, his foreign passport was legally void in India as soon as he acquired U.S. citizenship.\nBecause India does not recognize dual citizenship, he ceased to be a citizen of India on April 17,\n2002. Accordingly, the government asserts, and I agree, that the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s\nforeign passport no longer exist. I conclude Guideline C for the Applicant.\nForeign Influence. The government presented sufficient evidence to support the factual\nallegations in the SOR. As to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens of and reside in\nIndia. The record is silent about how often Applicant talks to his parents, but he has traveled to India\nseveral times to see them. Applicant and his wife also have close friends with whom they keep in\ntouch on a regular basis. These facts raise security concerns under Guideline B; that is, a security risk\nmay exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom\nhe or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States\nor may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that\ncould result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries\nor financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an\nindividual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  More specifically, of the\n24\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) listed under Guideline B, DC 1  must be considered in light of the\n25\navailable information about Applicant\u2019s parents and friends.\nOf the mitigating conditions listed (MC) under Guideline B, MC 5  must be considered.\n26\nAvailable information shows Applicant\u2019s interests are in the U.S., where he has lived and owned\nhomes since the 1990s. The fact he may inherit his parents\u2019 estate and/or the contents of their bank\naccounts is speculative at best, because it is also possible he may predecease his parents. Also\napplicable to these facts is MC 1.  Despite its disjunctive wording, to apply MC 1 it must be shown\n27\n\ninvolved and the United States.\n ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004). (Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1 is\n28\nbifurcated in nature and cannot be applied unless there is sufficient credible record evidence that an applicant's family\nmembers, cohabitant or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, and (b) not in a position to be\nexploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to choose between the person(s) involved and the\nUnited States. (Previous citations omitted.)).\n See footnote 21, supra.\n29\n Department Counsel averred in the FORM (p. 11 - 14) that the only potentially applicable \u201cwhole person\u201d\n30\nfactor to be considered in cases of possible foreign preference is whether there is potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress. While the other whole person factors pertain to conduct or specific events, making them logically\ninapposite to most foreign influence cases, they are not \u201cthe only ones that may be considered in performing a whole\nperson analysis in a Guideline B case...[M]any others raised by the facts of a given case can be properly factored in to\na judge\u2019s evaluation of an applicant\u2019s worthiness of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case 04-11414 (March 5, 2007), at 4\n(citations omitted).\n8\nthe persons in India to whom Applicant has close ties are not agents of a foreign power, and are not\nvulnerable to exploitation by a foreign government so that Applicant would have to choose between\ntheir well being and the interests of the United States.  As to the first prong of MC 1, none of\n28\nApplicant\u2019s foreign ties works for the Indian government or is an agent thereof. They are all retired\nand live independently of government benefits. Indeed, one of his close friends retired from\nemployment by a U.S. agency. \nAs to the second prong involving potential for coercion, available information shows that\nIndia is an open society, governed through a democratically-elected legislature and executive,\nchecked by an independent judiciary. While there are notable problems regarding human rights\nabuses by India, all of the available information probative issue shows Applicant\u2019s parents and\nfriends are not likely to be subject to the actions noted in the record. The U.S. and India enjoy close,\nmutually supportive political and trade relations, are working together in the global war on terror,\nand their interests in controlling nuclear proliferation are generally aligned. I am mindful of the\ninformation showing India is active in industrial espionage. Nonetheless, I conclude that there is little\nlikelihood India, a nation generally friendly toward the United States, will try to leverage Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with his parents and friends to gain access to the information with which Applicant\nworks. Based on the foregoing, I conclude SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b for the Applicant, and further\nconclude available information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline\nB.\nWhole Person. Having assessed the facts presented in this record and applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline B and Guideline C, I turn now to a review of the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors.  Applicant is 42 years old and has lived\n29\nin the United States for nearly 20 years. He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen, and helped raise\nher three children, now grown, from a previous marriage. He has established his life in the U.S., but\nhas quite naturally kept in touch with his parents and friends, none of whom has ties to the Indian\ngovernment. For the same reasons that Guideline B MC 1 applies, I conclude in this context that\nthere is little likelihood of coercion by the Indian government because, in addition to the adjudicative\nfactors already discussed,  Applicant is fully entrenched in the U.S., has no foreign financial\n30\ninterests, and is unlikely to compromise his life here.\n\n See footnote 20, supra.\n31\n9\nA fair and commonsense assessment  of the entire record before me shows the government\u2019s\n31\ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to classified information are based on reliable\ninformation about his earlier possession of a foreign passport and his close ties to foreign citizens.\nHowever, available information is also sufficient to resolve those doubts. Accordingly, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C (Foreign Preference): FOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\n  For the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B, (Foreign Influence):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\n  For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant a security clearance for the Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nMatthew E. Malone\nAdministrative Judge\n",

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRichard A. Stevens, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se Pro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 20-year-old college student, used marijuana once.  This occurred after she had\nsubmitted her electronic questionnaire for investigations processing.The record evidence is sufficient\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\nto mitigate or extenuate the negative security implications stemming from her single use of\nmarijuana. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 22, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\n1\nApplicant.  The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued\ndue to Drug Involvement.\nOn July 14, 2006, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On August 23,\n2006, I was assigned the case. On September 19, 2006, a Notice of Hearing was issued scheduling\nthe hearing which was held on October 17, 2006.  On October 30, 2006, DOHA received a copy of\nthe transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security significant Drug Involvement.  Applicant admits using marijuana\non one occasion after having submitted her electronic questionnaire. She realizes she made an\nincredibly bad decision that could jeopardize her future. The admissions are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact:\nApplicant is a 20-year-old student who has worked as a tech/intern for a defense contractor\nfrom June 2005 through August 2005 andis seeking to obtain a security clearance.  In August 2005,\nshe submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). She had a second\ninternship from May 2006 through August 2006.  Applicant is regarded by those who know her as\na hard worker, a person of great integrity, very conscientious, enthusiastic, focused, and as having\nhigh moral standards. (App Ex A, B, and C)\nApplicant is a college electrical engineering student and an intern. Applicant has a 3.383\nGPA and is in the top sixth of her group of junior electrical engineers. (Tr. 24)  In January 2006, she\nused marijuana.  At the time of her use, Applicant was with her former boyfriend and his friends.\nThe usage occurred at a low point in her life, where she gave into peer pressure. She is now in a\ndifferent position.  She feels better about herself and is a completely different person.  She realized\nher mistake and ended the relationship. She is no longer in contact with her former boyfriend or any\npeople who use illegal drugs.\nApplicant\u2019s dream since childhood was to be an engineer.  She has worked hard to get where\nshe is.  In high school, she was a cheerleader, a member of the band, and an honor student who\ngraduated with a 4.0 GPA in the top 10 percent of her class.  She graduated high school in May\n2004.  She met her former boyfriend in August 2004 when they had the same freshman college\ncourse.\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n3\nSince the incident, she is more aware of the people and situation around her. She no longer\ndrinks alcohol or is involved with people who drink. (Tr. 40)  She has become very involved in her\nchurch and teaches Sunday school. (Tr. 22)  She is no longer as concerned with impressing people.\n(Tr. 41)  She is no longer as stressed as she was and handles situations better.  In the future, she\nwould leave any place where there are illegal drugs. Applicant has matured and has learned from\nher mistake. She knows she made a bad decision, realizes the consequences of her actions, and will\nnever use illegal drugs again. (Tr. 17)\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here is Guideline H Drug Involvement.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate government's case.Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\n\n4\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement. Under Guideline H, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when\nthat applicant is involved with illegal drugs. The improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises\nquestions regarding an applicant\u2019s willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug\nabuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an\nunauthorized disclosure of classified information. Directive E.2.A.8.1.1.  Applicant used marijuana\nin January 2006. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 (E2.A8.1.2.1. Any drug abuse) applies. \nApplicant is a 20-year-old college student who used marijuana one time. This incident has\nbeen a great learning lesson for her. Mitigating Condition (MC) 2 (E2.A8.1.3.2. The drug\ninvolvement was an isolated or aberrational event) applies.  The fact the usage occurred less than\na year ago is of concern, but that concern is overcome by what Applicant has learned from the\nsituation.  She realizes she made a stupid mistake that could have a far reaching impact on her\nfuture.  She ended the relationship with her former boy friend.  She does not associate with people\nwho drink or use illegal drugs.  She has changed her friends and has become more involved with her\nchurch. She will not use marijuana again.  If placed in a similar situation, she will remove herself\nfrom the situation.  MC 3 (E2.A8.1.3.4. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future)\napplies. \nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; the Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct; the Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the\nconduct; the frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct\nwill continue or recur in the future. \nAfter considering the one time usage by this 20-year-old college student, the insight she has\ngained, the changes in her life, and her stated and demonstrated intent never to use illegal drugs in\nthe future, I find for Applicant as to Drug Involvement. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Drug Involvement: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\n\n5\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nClaude R. Heiny \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on November 10,\n2003. On November 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the criminal\nconduct guideline (Guideline J) and the misuse of information technology systems\nguideline (Guideline M). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her notarized answer to the SOR on November 21, 2007.\nShe elected to have her case decided administratively without a hearing. A copy of the\ngovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on January 22, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on\nJanuary 30, 2008. Applicant\u2019s response was received by DOHA on February 22, 2008.\nMarch 27, 2008\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to this administrative judge on March 6, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the FORM, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the one allegation under paragraph 1 (criminal conduct) and\none allegation under paragraph 2 (misuse of technology systems). Applicant is 32 years\nold and has been employed by a defense contractor since November 3, 2003. She\nseeks a security clearance. \nCriminal Conduct\nIn 2001, according to Applicant\u2019s interview on July 3, 2007, with an investigator\nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), she was 25 years old, and struggling\nat a city university on the west coast. She became involved with 20 other individuals\n(\u201cgroup\u201d) in the illegal uploading and downloading of pirated software. The reasons she\nbecame involved were \u201cit was during her stupid college years,\u201d and \u201cIt was a way of\nmeeting new people because she was bored.\u201d (interview with OPM, July 3, 2007) Some\nmembers of the group would upload software to servers, while others would download\nthe software. The software consisted of games, software, and movies. The software\nwas not sold outside the group. Applicant did not make a profit, and did not believe the\ngroup made a profit. \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted a raid on Applicant\u2019s dorm\nroom on December 11, 2001. Along with 20 other defendants, Applicant was indicted on\nJune 11, 2002, for reproducing software for private gain, over a six-month period ending\nDecember 11, 2001. The indictment stated that all the defendants were members of the\n\u201cgroup\u201d (formed in 1997), and engaged in a conspiracy to illegally reproduce\ncopyrighted material during a 180-day period ending on December 11, 2001, in violation\nof 17 U.S.C. 506(a)(2), and 18 U.S.C. 2319(c)(1). Applicant\u2019s overt acts in furtherance\nof the conspiracy occurred on July 5, 2001, when she accessed the primary server for\nthe \u201cgroup,\u201d and transferred pirated computer software, movies, and games.\nOn December 18, 2003, under the terms of a Plea Memorandum, Applicant\nentered her guilty plea with the United States (U.S.), because of her conduct on July 5,\n2001. The Plea Memorandum supplies more details of the illegal enterprise, including\nthe representation by the Government to recommend \u201cthe low end of any sentence\nwithin the applicable guideline range, as calculated above.\u201d (Plea Memorandum,\nDecember 18, 2003, p. 2) The conspiracy involved making available thousands of\ncopyrighted software programs and games, exceeding a retail value of $1,000,000.00,\nby uploading or downloading the software in violation of the copyrights. It was\ndetermined during the course of the investigation leading to the Plea Memorandum that\nthe group had a hierarchy of responsibility as follows: (1) \u201ccouncil members\u201d who\ndetermined the terms and conditions under which the \u201cgroup\u201d was to operate; (2) \u201csite\noperators\u201d who maintained the sites where the pirated software was located; (3)\n\u201ccouriers\u201d who specialized in transferring the illegal software around on the Internet;\n\n3\nand, \u201cmembers\u201d who had achieved membership in the \u201cgroup\u201d but had no specific role\nin the hierarchy. The Assistant United States Attorney classified Applicant as a\n\u201cmember.\u201d (Plea Memorandum, Facts to Support a Plea of Guilty, p. 9) \nOn July 11, 2007, Applicant was sentenced to one count of conspiracy, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. 371. She received 36 months probation retroactive to December\n18, 2003, the date that Applicant pled guilty. She also was assessed a $1,000.00 fine. \nIn an attachment to her answer to the SOR, Applicant explained how her illegal\nconduct helped turn her life around, both academically and professionally. She stated: \nIn general, we tend to focus on the negative parts of a person\u2019s life, yet,\nignore what the person has done after they have made a mistake. The\nmistake that I made is stated in paragraph 1a in the Statement of\nReasons. I admit my wrongdoing. Instead of making excuses or finding\nways to deny my involvement, I pled guilty. I don\u2019t regret what happened\nsince it has changed my life for the better. However, I do apologize for\nwhat I did. Before it happened, I was struggling with school and struggling\nwith my life. I was failing classes and I was close to academic probation. \nNext, she explained in the attachment that after the police raided her dorm room\nin December 2001, she sank into a period of depression, where she basically felt sorry\nfor herself. A few months later, she decided changes in her life were necessary, and\nshe was the only person to effect change. Her grades began to improve. She stated:\nOn December 2003, I received my Bachelors\u2019 degree in Computer\nScience. I have been working for [employer] for four years and enjoy what\nI do. A year ago I bought my first house. I feel that I turned a bad situation\ninto something good. I have learned my lesson. I am more aware of what I\ndo. I think before I act. It has been an emotional battle, but I know how to\ndeal with it. I have faith that every thing will get better and that keeps me\ngoing. \nMisuse of Technology Systems\nOn July 5, 2001, Applicant inappropriately accessed the primary file transfer\nprotocol and transferred pirated software.\nCharacter Evidence\nOn June 29, 2007, the Human Relations Generalist of Applicant\u2019s employer\nauthored a letter to the presiding judge describing Applicant\u2019s character. The human\nrelations official indicated that Applicant told him about her crime, her regret for\nbecoming involved, and her assurance the behavior would never happen again. The\nofficial noted Applicant had a promising future based on (1) her dependability as an\nemployee, and (2) her successful job performance. \n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s older sister recalled in a character statement dated February 12,\n2008 (part of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM), that while in college, Applicant had no\ndirection, and was in an abusive relationship. The older sister was impressed by\ndramatic changes Applicant underwent following the offense by finishing college in\nDecember 2003, and beginning her career with her employer in November 2003.\nApplicant\u2019s younger sister wrote a character statement extolling the favorable changes\nApplicant made in finishing school in December 2003, and providing a positive impact at\nher job. Applicant also served as a mentor for several of her younger sister\u2019s high\nschool classmates. A friend who met Applicant in church in September 2007 considers\nher a caring person. \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations for 2005 through 2007 show her successful\njob performance. Applicant\u2019s scholastic transcript shows that she received her\nBachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer Science on December 18, 2003. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law that are applied in conjunction with the\ngeneral policy factors of the whole person concept. The Administrative Judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government places a high degree of trust and confidence\n\n5\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include\nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nCriminal behavior casts doubts concerning a person\u2019s judgment and\ntrustworthiness.\nMisuse of Technology Systems (MTS)\nMisuse or noncompliance with technology systems that raises questions about a\nperson\u2019s willingness to properly protect computer systems. \nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Government has established a case under the CC guideline. On December\n18, 2003, Applicant pled guilty to knowingly conspiring with others to make available\nthousands of copyrighted programs, movies and games exceeding a value of\n$1,000,000.00, a violation of 18 U.S.C. 371, conspiracy to commit copyright\ninfringement. On June 29, 2007, Applicant was sentenced to three years probation,\nretroactive to December 18, 2003 (date of guilty plea). She was fined $1,000.00. CC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 31.a. (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses)\napplies. \nHowever, CC mitigating condition (MC) 32.a. (so much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) and CC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement) also apply. Almost seven\nyears have passed since the crime occurred. Applicant has made spectacular changes\nin her life. In December 2003, she obtained her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Computer\nScience, and, for the past four years, has been applying her knowledge as a software\nengineer with her employer. Based on her comments to the OPM investigator in July\n2007 and her answer to the SOR, I am confident she will not repeat the poor judgment\nshe demonstrated in 2001. The observations of the human relations official, her sisters\nand her friend, persuasively show me she understands the gravity of her behavior, and\nwill never repeat this conduct in the future. \n\n6\nEven though Applicant was under the jurisdiction of the court until she was\nsentenced in July 2007, thereby subject to probable incarceration for violating any of the\nterms of the Plea Memorandum, the passage of at least six years without a recurrence\nof criminal activity is entitled to some mitigation. Also, based on her poignant statements\nabout the criminal behavior being a watershed event in her life, I am convinced\nApplicant is remorseful for her exhibition of poor judgment. Rather than continuing to\nfeel sorry for herself after the offense was uncovered in December 2001, she devoted\nreinvigorated attention to her academics and improved her scholastic average. Her\nperseverance paid off when she graduated from college in December 2003. Even\nbefore she graduated from school, her current employer clearly took a chance on her by\ngranting her a position in November 2003. She has produced a good job performance\nfor more than four years. She has also had an impact on her younger sister\u2019s high\nschool friends by providing mentoring advice. On balance, the evidence produced under\nCC MC 32.a. and 32.d. warrant a finding for Applicant under the CC guideline. \nMisuse of Technology Systems (MTS)\nUnder the MTS guideline, security concerns are raised over the noncompliance\nwith rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information technology\nsystems may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect\nsensitive systems, networks, and information. Information technology systems include\nall related computer hardware, software, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation. \nThe Government has established its case under paragraph 2.a. Applicant\nknowingly used her computer to access the group\u2019s primary software site, and\ntransferred pirated software. She admitted she violated the federal law of conspiracy to\ncommit copyright infringement. She knew her behavior was wrong. MTS DC 40.f.\n(introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or\nfrom any information technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules,\nprocedures, guidelines or regulations) applies. \nHowever, MTS MC 41.a. (so much time has elapsed since the behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment)\napplies. First, the Plea Memorandum addressing the details of the conspiracy shows\nthat Applicant\u2019s participation in the criminal enterprise was minor as determined by the\nprosecuting U.S. Attorney. Second, her conduct has not been repeated since 2001.\nThird, in the six-year period after her apprehension, Applicant has used her time wisely\nby obtaining her degree in December 2003, and compiling a good job performance\nrecord over the last four years. The MTS guideline is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nApplicant has met her burden of persuasion under the CC and MTS guidelines.\nThe same conclusion is reached even after the circumstances of this case are\nevaluated in the context of the whole person. Rehabilitation begins with the person\ncomprehending the seriousness of their conduct. Applicant has proven in her statement\nto OPM in July 2007 and her November 2007 answer to the SOR that she fully\nembraces the stupidity of her conduct in 2001. However, instead of flunking out of\nschool, she rallied herself to finish school and find a job in her field. The documented\nsuccess academically and professionally, translates to substantial behavioral changes\nthat eliminate the chances of this kind of conduct recurring. Both the CC and MTS\nguidelines are found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Misuse of Technology Systems, Guideline M): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant mitigated the personal conduct concerns, but failed to mitigate\nthe financial considerations and criminal conduct concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nSee Department Counsel\u2019s Memo, HE III.\n2\nTr. at 90-96, 104-105.\n3\nTr. at 32; GE 1.\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On July 21, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the\nDirective. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 4, 2006 and September 12, 2006, and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February\n5, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on February 16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for March 9,\n2007. Applicant waived the 15-day notice requirement. With the consent of the parties, the hearing\nwas conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered seven exhibits that\nwere marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, and admitted without objection. Applicant\ntestified, but did not offer any exhibits. The record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity\nto submit additional material. Applicant did not submit any additional material.  DOHA received the\n2\nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 19, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the Statement of Reasons. The motion was marked as\nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant was provided a copy of the motion in advance of the hearing.\nDepartment Counsel moved to add two allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h and 2.i, as contained in HE I.\nApplicant did not object. I granted the motion. Department Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2.e, by\nchanging the words, \u201csubparagraph 1.c.\u201d in the third line to \u201csubparagraph 1.a.\u201d Applicant did not\nobject, and I granted the motion. Department Counsel further moved to amend SOR \u00b6 3.b, by\ninserting \u201c2.h. and 2.i.,\u201d after \u201c2.e.\u201d That motion was denied.  \n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant has several years of\ncollege, but does not have a degree. He is single with one child, who lives with the child\u2019s mother.4\n\nTr. at 53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n5\nGE 2 at 3.\n6\nTr. at 35-37; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 1.\n7\nTr. at 37-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2.\n8\nTr. at 44-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 1.\n9\nTr. at 45-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 2.\n10\nTr. at 47-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 1.\n11\n4\nApplicant admits he owes the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i. He attributes his\nfinancial problems to being young and irresponsible.5\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment for $3,447 entered in 2000, for a delinquent student loan\nfor college tuition. Applicant received a garnishment summons to appear in August 2006. The\nsummons showed the judgment of $3,447, with a credit of $1,344, and additional interest and costs\nof $2,007, for a balance owed of $4,110.  Applicant testified that his wages have been garnished and\n6\nthat he is paying $100 per month additional to the garnishment. Applicant estimates that the debt is\nnow less than $2,000. Applicant submitted no documentation to verify any payments.7\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a debt of $140 to a state agency for overpaid unemployment\nbenefits. Applicant testified that the state took money from his state income tax refund for this debt.\nHe believes that the debt is now $43. The most recent credit report shows the debt at $63.8\nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a judgment of $7,265 entered in 2001, for a delinquent student loan for\ncollege tuition. Applicant disputed the underlying debt because he stated he had a scholarship. He\nstated he contacted the school but they referred him to their attorneys. He has no further information\non this debt.9\n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a debt of $513 to a bank for overdrafts. The debt is unpaid.\nApplicant stated he is looking into a debt consolidation loan to address this and his other delinquent\ndebts.10\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g are three medical debts to unknown providers in the amounts of\n$146, $155, and $230. SOR \u00b6 1.h lists a judgment of $272, entered in 2004 on behalf of a hospital.\nApplicant was in a car accident a few years ago in which he was a passenger. He states that all the\nmedical bills are related to that accident. Applicant states he recently received a settlement for the\naccident and that any medical debts will be paid.  Based upon the evidence presented, it is unclear\n11\nif any of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g, were the underlying debt that resulted in the judgment\nin SOR \u00b6 1.h.\n\nTr. at 49-50; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2.\n12\nTr. at 51-54; GE 4 at 1. This debt is not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when\n13\nanalyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions.\nTr. at 54.\n14\nTr. at 65-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n15\nTr. at 69-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2.\n16\nTr. at 71-73; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n17\nTr. at 73-74; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7 at 1.\n18\n5\nApplicant admitted to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, in the amount of $381 for a delinquent phone\nbill. He has not paid this debt.  \n12\nThe credit report of March 6, 2007, lists a new delinquent debt of $153 for a cell phone. This\ndebt was initiated in about May 2006. Applicant admitted he still owed this debt.13\nApplicant has never received financial counseling.  He has a plan is to pay his debts through\n14\na debt consolidation loan from his credit union, but has done little thus far to voluntarily pay his\ndebts.\nApplicant was stopped by the police in July 1995, and cited for driving on a\nrevoked/suspended license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant admits that he was\ndriving on a suspended license. He does not remember whether he knew at the time that his license\nhad been suspended. The case was dismissed after Applicant provided proof to the court that his\nlicense had been reinstated.15\nApplicant was charged in September 1996, with soliciting prostitution, a misdemeanor, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. He was found guilty, and paid approximately $315 in fines and court costs.16\nApplicant was stopped by the police in February 1999, and cited for driving on a\nrevoked/suspended license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. The charge was Nolle Prosequi,\ni.e., dismissed. Applicant admits that he was driving on a suspended license. He does not remember\nwhether he knew at the time that his license had been suspended. Applicant continued to drive after\nthis incident, knowing that his license was expired.17\nApplicant was stopped by the police in July 2001, and cited for not having a driver\u2019s license,\na misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. He was found guilty and ordered to pay a $100 fine and $40\ncourt costs.  \n18\n\nTr. at 85-88; GE 7 at 1, 6.\n19\nSee, www.courts.state.va.us/mag/page1.htm.\n20\nTr. at 74-82; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 2; GE 7 at 1-2.\n21\nTr. at 88-90; GE 7 at 1, 7.\n22\nTr. at 82-84; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7 at 1, 3.\n23\nTr. at 73-74, 83, 97, 110-111; GE 4 at 1. The times that Applicant drove without a license, which were not\n24\nalleged in the SOR, are not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when analyzing the \u201cwhole\nperson,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions.\n6\nApplicant was stopped by the police in April 2002, and cited for driving while suspended,\namended to not having a driver\u2019s license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.h. He was found\nguilty and ordered to pay a $25 fine and court costs of $164.19\nApplicant was arrested on a capias warrant on about July 18, 2002, for failure to appear, as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. A court may issue a capias should a person fail to appear in court pursuant\neither to a summons or a subpoena. The capias requires the arrest of the accused and a subsequent\nbail hearing. At the hearing triggered by the capias, the court may fine or jail the person for failing\nto appear.  In this case the capias was dismissed.  There is insufficient evidence of any criminal\n20\n21\nresponsibility on Applicant\u2019s part, as relates to this warrant and arrest.\nApplicant was stopped by the police in October 2002, and cited for driving on a revoked\nlicense, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.i. The charge was Nolle Prosequi.22\nApplicant was stopped by the police on about August 12, 2004, and cited for driving on a\nrevoked/suspended license, a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f. A capias warrant was issued on\nabout September 23, 2004, for Applicant\u2019s failure to appear, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.g. The warrant\nwas dismissed in February 2005, when Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to 90 days in jail,\nsuspended, a fine of $100 and court costs of $178.  I find Applicant criminally responsible for the\n23\nmisdemeanor offense of driving on a revoked/suspended license, but there is insufficient evidence\nto find him criminally responsible for failure to appear.\nApplicant admitted that he regularly drove from about 1999 to at least 2004, knowing that\nhis license was suspended or revoked. He testified that he has possessed a valid driver\u2019s license for\nabout six to eight months, and that he has not driven with a suspended or revoked license for more\nthan a year.24\nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86 (SF-86), on August\n3, 2004. Question 26 of the SF-86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged\nwith, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic\nfines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.). For this item, report\ninformation regardless of whether the record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken\nfrom the record. The single exception is to this requirement is for certain convictions under the\n\nGE 1 at 6.\n25\nTr. at 98-105.\n26\nGE 1 at 7.\n27\nTr. at 61-65.\n28\nTr. at 105-110; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n29\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n30\n7\nFederal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the\nauthority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNO.\u201d  \n25\nApplicant stated he answered \u201cNO\u201d because he misunderstood the question. Applicant\nthought the question asked to list arrests for the offenses listed in modules 21 to 25. Applicant was\nstill not certain at the hearing if he should have listed his offenses.  The only time Applicant was\n26\ntruly arrested during the period in question was when he was picked up for the failure to appear\nwarrant. That warrant was dismissed. Applicant was not arrested for the driving related charges; he\nwas issued citations to appear in court. He had several traffic-related convictions during the period\nin question, but none of them carried a fine of more than $150. After considering all the evidence,\nand gauging Applicant\u2019s credibility, I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SF-86 by\nomitting the information contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c through 2.e, 2.h, and 2.i. \nQuestion 37 of the SF-86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you\nthat have not been paid?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYES,\u201d and listed a 2001 judgment of $7,000. He did\nnot specifically list the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  Applicant was unsure why he did not list the\n27\nadditional judgment, but was adamant that he did not intentionally falsify the security clearance\napplication.  I find Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SF-86 by only listing one judgment\n28\nin response to Question 37.\nApplicant was scheduled to be interviewed during his background investigation in about late\nFebruary 2005, and then again in early March 2005. Applicant testified he had scheduling conflicts\nand was unable to attend either scheduled interview. He attempted to contact the investigator about\nthe meetings but was unable to do so. No other evidence was introduced. He was interviewed by an\ninvestigator in December 2005.29\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n30\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\n\nId. at 527.\n31\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n32\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n33\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n34\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n35\n8\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n31\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n32\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n33\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n34\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n35\nThe Directive sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions\n(MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 and \u00b6 E2.2.1 of the\nDirective.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nE2.A6.1.2.1 (A history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (Inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts), apply in this case. Applicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts\n\n9\nthat remain unsatisfied. I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g, in Applicant\u2019s favor, as there is insufficient\nevidence to show that these were not the underlying debts that resulted in the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.h.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (The behavior was not recent), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (It\nwas an isolated incident), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (The conditions that resulted in the behavior were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (The person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (The individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts accrued over a several year period. Most remain\nunpaid. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 do not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to youth and irresponsibility. Four of the debts were\nmedical debts, and related to a car accident in which Applicant was a passenger. The total of the four\ndebts is $803, a small figure compared to the total amount owed. Applicant is given some credit\nunder FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 for his medical debts. The other debts did not result from conditions that\nwere largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control.\nApplicant has not received counseling for his financial problem, nor has he shown that his\nfinancial problems are being resolved or under control. Applicant continues to accrue new delinquent\ndebt, as evidenced by the delinquent cell phone bill. While he states he has a plan to resolve his\nproblems, he has not implemented that plan. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 is not applicable.\nApplicant has done almost nothing to voluntarily pay the debts in issue. Applicant\u2019s wages\nare being garnished for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant testified, but did not provide supporting\ndocumentation, that he has paid several hundred dollars in additional payments toward this same\ndebt. Money has been taken out of Applicant\u2019s state income tax refunds for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b.\nApplicant\u2019s actions do not constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 does not apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nA history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.\nApplicant was convicted of soliciting prostitution in 1996. He has numerous citations and\nconvictions for driving on a suspended or revoked license. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) both apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (The criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.2 (The crime was an isolated incident), and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (There is clear\n\n10\nevidence of successful rehabilitation). Applicant drove regularly for a number of years with a\nsuspended or revoked driver\u2019s license. He knew he was violating the law every time he did so. While\nit has been more than two years since Applicant\u2019s last conviction, his testimony was that he has\npossessed a valid driver\u2019s license for only about six to eight months, and that he has not driven with\na suspended or revoked license for more than a year. Under these circumstances, I conclude that no\nmitigating condition applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that the person may\nnot properly safeguard classified information. \nBased on all the evidence, I have considered the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions\n(PC DC) and concerns addressed in E2.A5.1.1.1 (Refusal to undergo or cooperate with required\nsecurity processing, including medical and psychological testing), E2.A5.1.1.2 (Refusal to complete\nrequired security forms, releases, or provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials or other official representatives in connection with a personnel\nsecurity or trustworthiness determination), and E2.A5.1.2.2 (The deliberate omission, concealment\nor falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities).\nI do not find a refusal to cooperate with the investigators on Applicant\u2019s part. He testified that\nhe had a scheduling conflict that caused him to miss the first two meetings, but that he\nunsuccessfully attempted to contact the investigator to reschedule. No evidence was presented to\nrebut this. I conclude SOR \u00b6 3.a in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs discussed above, Applicant did not list all his criminal activity under Question 26 of his\nSF-86. The criminal activity in question was an arrest pursuant to a warrant, which was then\ndismissed, and traffic convictions. His traffic offenses were criminal, but carried fines of less than\n$150. Applicant was still uncertain at the hearing if he was required to list the traffic-related\nconvictions. I do not find an intentional falsification. SOR \u00b6 3.b is concluded in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nApplicant listed one judgment in response to Question 37, but did not list his other judgment.\nAfter considering all the evidence, I find this was not an intentional attempt to conceal information.\nI conclude SOR \u00b6 3.a in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive. I have also considered every finding of fact and conclusion discussed\nabove. \n\n11\nApplicant has a number of delinquent debts that remain unpaid. He recently incurred an\nadditional delinquent debt for a cell phone. Of particular concern is Applicant\u2019s criminal activity.\nHis disregard for the law cannot be ignored. He drove on a suspended or revoked license for years,\nwithout regard that he was breaking the law every time he did so. He continued to drive without a\nvalid license despite numerous citations and convictions. Applicant did not falsify his security\nclearance application, or intentionally fail to cooperate with investigators. Applicant was simply\ndisplaying the same lack of care and concern in the submission of the application and the interview\nprocess, that he has shown in relation to his finances and his driving. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct\nconcerns, but has not mitigated the security concerns based on his financial issues and criminal\nconduct.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant argues that the Department Counsel did not present substantial evidence on the question of whether Applicant\u2019s having voted in the Israeli election was contrary to the interests of the United States, with the result that the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant. This argument is without merit. The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 7, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed properly to consider\nand weigh the record evidence and whether her adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nApplicant was born in the United States but moved with his family to Europe when he was\n13 years old.  Graduating from high school in 1970, he moved to Israel in 1975 to attend college,\nfollowing an enlistment in the U.S. Air Force.  While there \u201che was conscripted into the Israeli army\nfrom 1977 until May 1978.\u201d  Decision at 2.

In November 2002, he returned to Israel for what he characterized as a\n\u201cvacation\u201d or \u201csightseeing time,\u201d traveling with a \u201cone-year temporary\u201d Israeli passport.  Id.

Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider certain pieces of record evidence,\nincluding the relative extent of Applicant\u2019s ties with Israel and the United States, his character\nreferences, his service in the U.S. military and honorable discharge therefrom, and other similar\nmatters.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence, and there is nothing to\nindicate that she did otherwise in this particular case.  See ISCR Case No. 05-14488 at 4 (App. Bd.\nAug. 10, 2007).  See also ISCR Case No. 02-29373 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 2005).\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred as to the length of time he spent in the Israeli\nmilitary, asserting that it was only 5 \u00bd to 6 months rather than the arguably longer time contained\nin the findings of fact.  Assuming without deciding that the Judge\u2019s finding is error, we conclude that\nit would not have changed the outcome of the case.   See ISCR 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5,\n2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 at 5 (App.\nBd. Aug. 26, 2002).  Therefore, it is harmless.    \nApplicant argues that the Department Counsel did not present substantial evidence on the\nquestion of whether Applicant\u2019s having voted in the Israeli election was contrary to the interests of\nthe United States, with the result that the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion to\nApplicant.  This argument is without merit.  The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational\nconnection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28935 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-\n31188 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2005).  One potential Guideline C disqualifying condition (DC) is\n\u201cvoting in a foreign election.\u201d   SOR paragraph 1(c) alleges that Applicant \u201cvoted in the 2003 Israeli\n3\nelections, while residing in Israel from November 2002 until March 2003.\u201d  Neither the Adjudicative\nGuidelines nor the SOR make conflict with U.S. interests an element of this DC which Department\nCounsel must affirmatively prove by substantial evidence before the burden of persuasion shifts to\nApplicant.  In any event, Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR, relieving\nDepartment Counsel of her obligation to produce evidence concerning it.  This admission is enough\nto shift the burden of persuasion to Applicant. Therefore, there is no error in the Judge\u2019s treatment\nof the parties\u2019 burdens in this case.  \nApplicant points to some cases by Hearing Office Judges which he contends support granting\nhim a clearance.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  However, such decisions are\nbinding neither on Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 03-26115 at 3 (App.\nBd. Apr. 5, 2007).\n\n4\nWe have evaluated the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.

See ISCR 01-23362 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004); ISCR Case No. 01-11192 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002). Therefore, it is harmless. Applicant argues that the Department Counsel did not present substantial evidence on the question of whether Applicant\u2019s having voted in the Israeli election was contrary to the interests of the United States, with the result that the Judge impermissibly shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant. This argument is without merit. The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28935 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02- 31188 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2005). One potential Guideline C disqualifying condition (DC) is \u201cvoting in a foreign election.\u201d SOR paragraph 1(c) alleges that Applicant \u201cvoted in the 2003 Israeli 3 elections, while residing in Israel from November 2002 until March 2003.\u201d Neither the Adjudicative Guidelines nor the SOR make conflict with U.S. interests an element of this DC which Department Counsel must affirmatively prove by substantial evidence before the burden of persuasion shifts to Applicant. In any event, Applicant admitted this allegation in his response to the SOR, relieving Department Counsel of her obligation to produce evidence concerning it. This admission is enough to shift the burden of persuasion to Applicant. Therefore, there is no error in the Judge\u2019s treatment of the parties\u2019 burdens in this case. Applicant points to some cases by Hearing Office Judges which he contends support granting him a clearance. The Board gives due consideration to these cases. However, such decisions are binding neither on Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board. See ISCR Case No. 03-26115 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2007). 4 We have evaluated the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole. She considered both the fact that Applicant surrendered his Israeli passport and that he expressed an intent to renounce Israeli citizenship. However, she concluded that such relatively belated actions, having taken place close to or on the day of the hearing, were not sufficient to outweigh \u201chis long term attachment to Israel,\u201d and his \u201crecent outreach\u201d to that country. This outreach was evidenced by his having moved back there in 2002 with an Israeli passport and having voted in an Israeli election.

He was born\nin the U.S. He lived in Israel from 1975 until 1981 and became a citizen. He was conscripted into\nthe Israeli army.  He returned to the U.S. and retired from the U.S. military after 20 years of\nhonorable service. He returned to Israel in 2002 and lived there until 2003.While there he voted in\nan election. He failed to mitigate security concerns arising from foreign preference. Clearance is\ndenied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nGE 1 (Standard Form 86 (SF 86), Security Clearance Application , dated April 10, 2005) at 1-11. \n2\nTr. 64.\n3\nTr. 65. \n4\nTr. 83-84.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statements of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it was clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nIn a sworn statement, dated June 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On February 27, 2007, the case was assigned to me.\nOn March 14, 2007, the notice of hearing was issued. On March 27, 2007, the hearing was held.\nApplicant waived his right to the 15 day notice requirement. At the hearing, the government\nsubmitted three exhibits which were marked and entered into the record without objection as GE 1-3.\nApplicant submitted six exhibits which were marked and entered into the record as Applicant\nExhibit (AE) A through F. At the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record remain open\nfor a post-hearing submission. On March 27, 2007, Applicant sent  a receipt of registered mail, dated\nMarch 27, 2007. This was marked as AE G and entered into the record without objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Guideline\nC (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c). Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant, who is 55-years-old, has worked as an instructor for a defense contractor since\n2004.  He was born in the U.S. but left the country with his parents when he was 13 years old to live\n2\nin Europe.  His father worked for the military as a civilian. Applicant graduated from high school\n3\nin 1970. He joined the U.S. Air Force in 1972 for three years. In August 1975, he decided to move\nto Israel to attend college.  He traveled on his U.S. passport. He took courses but did not receive a\n4\ndegree. While he lived in Israel he was conscripted into the Israeli army from 1977 until May 1978.\nDuring that time he married a woman he met in Taiwan. He left Israel in 1981 to return to the U.S.\nHe has since divorced his first wife who is now deceased.5\n\nAE A (Certificate of release or Discharge from Active Duty, dated 1998) at 1.\n6\nAE B (Meritorious Service Medal, dated April 23, 1998) at 1.\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 72. \n9\nTr. 73.\n10\nTr. 74-76.\n11\nGE, supra n. 1 at 1-11.\n12\nAE C (Letters of Reference, dated March 2007) at 1-6.\n13\n4\nUnder the Israeli Law of Return, Applicant acquired Israeli citizenship. He has maintained\nhis dual citizenship throughout the years. When he returned to the U.S., he joined the U.S. Army and\nserved for 20 years. He retired in 1998.   He also received a Meritorious Service Medal.  He held a\n6\n7\nsecurity clearance (at one point in time a top secret) while in the U.S. military. He completed his\nundergraduate degree in 1985. \nAfter his military retirement, Applicant worked in the private sector doing security work from\n1998 until 2002.  He decided to return to Israel in November 2002 due to his spiritual connection\n8\nwith Israel based on his Jewish faith. He applied for a one-year temporary passport. He describes the\ntime as a \"chilling out\" or vacation and sightseeing time. He rented a room from a family and was\nnot working for the U.S. government at the time.  In 2003, he voted in an Israeli election for a\n9\nparliament seat. He did not think anything of this, and acknowledged he did it because others were\ndoing it. He believed he was promoting U.S. policies in the region.10\nApplicant proclaims he would not bear arms for Israel and has no financial ties to the country.\nHe does not plan to vote again in Israel. He signed a notarized document on March 11, 2007\nrenouncing his Israeli citizenship. On the day of the hearing, he again affirmed his renunciation. He\nsurrendered his Israeli passport to the Embassy by mailing it on the day of the hearing. He wants to\ngo on with his work and believes this one-time occurrence should not have any bearing on his\nretaining a security clearance.11\nHe submitted a security clearance application on April 10, 2005.  During his two years as\n12\nan instructor for the defense contractor he has garnered praise from his supervisors.  He has the\n13\nrecommendation of his Chief Operating Officer.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline,\nthe adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n14\n5\nor revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions)\nand those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access\nto classified information (Mitigating Conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules\nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied\nin conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section\nE2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and\nimpartial commonsense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\"whole person concept,\" all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The Adjudicative\nProcess factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's  age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \"clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security\" or \"clearly consistent with the national interest.\" For\nthe purposes herein, despite the different wording in each, I have concluded all of the standards are\nthe same. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that\nare grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the\ngovernment to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the\n14\napplicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Para E3.1.15.\n15\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Para. E2.2.2\n16\n6\novercome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant\u2019s clearance.15\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. Because of this special relationship, the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom\nit grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect\nor safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Any\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved\nin favor of national security.16\nOne additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are\nnot at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that\nindustrial security clearance decisions shall be, \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Security clearance decisions cover\nmany characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this\ndecision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express\nor implied decision as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in\nthe SOR. \nForeign Preference\nThe government established its case under Guideline C. Applicant admits that he voted in a\n2003 election in Israel. He cites no reason for doing so. He served in the Israeli Army for a year. He\nresided in Israel and obtained citizenship under the Law of Return. These raise a security concern,\nunder Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) AG \u00b6 10 (a) (exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member) and (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign\ncitizenship by an American citizen.\nWhen the Government's initial burden has been met and a disqualifying condition raised, the\nburden shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation, or mitigation,\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.\n\n7\nApplicant has renounced his Israeli citizenship and has surrendered his passport to his\nEmbassy. Thus, Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MI) AG \u00b6 11 (b) the individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship  and FP MI AG \u00b6 11 (e) the passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated apply. \nI have considered the other mitigating conditions and find that none apply.\nWhole Person \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. As noted above, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in\nconsidering the whole person concept. It recognizes a person be viewed by the totality of his or her\nacts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits,\ntaking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.\nI considered both the record evidence and Applicant in light of the whole-person concept.\nI have also considered the fact that Applicant is a mature individual with a 20 year military service\nrecord. He successfully held a security clearance for many years. However, his long term attachment\nto Israel and his recent outreach to live there for a period of time and vote in an election are clear\nexercises of Israeli citizenship. Granted he now renounces the citizenship and has surrendered his\npassport, but that does not outweigh his reaching out to Israel in 2003. Applicant failed to meet his\nburden of persuasion. Under the current guideline, Applicant's conduct represents an unacceptable\nsecurity risk. I find the allegations regarding foreign preference against Applicant. Clearance is\ndenied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n              Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:           \n AgainstApplicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The case was assigned to\nme on October 2, 2006. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 20, 2006, and the hearing was\nheld on December 21, 2006.

She further testified that she\nusually has no money left over at the end of each month.\nApplicant completed and executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA) on October 27,\n2000 (Exhibit 1). She provided false material information in response to Questions 33,  38 and 39\nwhen she stated that (1) she had not filed for bankruptcy during the previous seven years, (2) she had\nnot been over 180 days delinquent on any debt during the previous seven years, and (3) she was not\nthen over 90 days delinquent on any debt.\nApplicant completed and executed a second SCA on January 20, 2003 (Exhibit 2). She\nprovided the same false information in response to the same three questions.2\nWith respect to the first SCA, applicant testified that although she knew her \u201cno\u201d responses\nwere wrong, she was having trouble with the computer while completing the SCA, and was under\npressure to get it done, so she just answered \u201cno.\u201d She doesn\u2019t know why she didn\u2019t explain her\nactions in the \u201cGeneral Remarks\u201d section (Question 43) (TR at 29-30). Regarding the second SCA,\nshe testified that she just copied her answers from the first SCA. She did so even though she knew\nher responses to the three questions on the first SCA were false. Although applicant testified that she\ndid not intend to deceive the Government, the facts speak otherwise. Based on the evidence\npresented, I find that applicant\u2019s falsifications on both SCAs were intentional.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAfter giving applicant the benefit of the doubt with respect to the debts alleged in SOR\nParagraphs 1d, 1e, 1f, 1g, and1i, the evidence establishes that she is currently indebted to at least\n\n4\nfive different creditors in the total past-due amount of approximately $32,000.00. These facts require\napplication of Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1 (a history of not meeting financial obligations)\nand E2.A6.1.2.3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).\nAlthough applicant testified credibly that most of her financial problems resulted from her\nattempt to help out family members, the fact remains these decisions to help her family members\nwere made by her voluntarily. Accordingly,  Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.3 (the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control) does not apply. Mitigating\nCondition E2.A6.1.3.6 (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) is not applicable either because applicant has done very little to satisfy\nher past-due debts.\nApplicant has the income to satisfy her current bills. However, when her past-due debts are\nfactored in, she is clearly financially overextended. As such, her situation fits squarely within the\nFinancial Guideline Concern expressed in the Directive (E2.A6.1.1.1 - An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.). Based on\nthis fact, I have no choice but to conclude that it is not now clearly consistent with the national\ninterest for applicant to have access to classified information.\nWith respect to Guideline E, applicant\u2019s falsifications of material facts on the SCAs are\nextremely troubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals\nseeking access to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts\non an SCA, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the good\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders. Applicant\u2019s intentional\nfalsifications require application of Disqualifying Condition  E2.A5.1.2.2 (the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire  . . .).  No Mitigating Conditions apply.  Based on the foregoing, Guideline E is found\nagainst applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested the case be decided\non the written record.  On May 24, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Joseph\nTestan denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by\nfailing to disclose 14 debts that had been delinquent for more than 90 or 180 days, as well as an\nunpaid Judgement in response to three different questions.  In support of that argument, Applicant\ncontends that he failed to disclose the information because he was ashamed of his credit history.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  His ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuidelines E and J is likewise sustainable.\n \n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns\nraised by his history of financial difficulties had been mitigated because he had paid off most of the\ndebts and was making payments on the remainder of them.  Again, Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred. \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish mitigation.\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.   The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply\non a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application\nrequires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly disagrees with\nthe Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\n\n3\ncontrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a history of not meeting financial obligations\nwhich extended over many years.  At the time the case was submitted for decision he still had\noutstanding debts and was still in the process of making arrangements to repay them.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were recent and\nstill ongoing.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at\n4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  The Judge specifically noted that Applicant had paid off many of the\ndebts.  The Board does not review a case de novo.   Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a 43-year-old network\nengineer employed by a Defense contractor in a foreign country (Host Nation).  He has resided in\nthat country since 1993.  He married his wife in 1995, and he and his wife had a daughter in 1998.\nHis wife is a national of a third country and the daughter was born there.  \nIn December 2002 Applicant and his family traveled to the U.S. to visit Applicant\u2019s parents.\nToward the end of the visit, Applicant\u2019s wife insisted that they stay at a hotel rather than with the\nparents.

The\nnext morning Applicant visited them, and, while he went to an ATM machine to get money, the wife\nand daughter checked out of the hotel.  Applicant returned to the Host Nation and continued his\nemployment for the defense contractor.  Applicant stated at the hearing that he did not know where\nhis family went, or where they had been since that day.  In early 2003 he was informed by a\nrepresentative of the local office of the Staff Judge Advocate that his wife had made allegations\nagainst him.  These allegations were that Applicant had raped and assaulted his wife and that he had\nphysically and sexually abused his daughter, and some of those alleged incidents occurred in the\nHost Nation where Applicant accompanied the Army.  The Judge stated, in a footnote, that it \u201cis\nunnecessary to describe in detail the sexual conduct, other than to find the conduct was inappropriate\nand would constitute physical and sexual assaults and indecent acts with a child.\u201d  Decision at 6.\nThe wife and daughter were interviewed by the protective services system (PPS) of State A.  PPS\nprepared a report, included as part of Government Exhibit 2, Army Criminal Investigation Command\n(CID) Report.  The wife also filed for custody of the daughter, alleging physical and sexual abuse\nof the daughter as well as abandonment.  The Judge\u2019s findings quote at length a signed, sworn\nstatement by the wife describing abuse alleged to have been inflicted by Applicant upon the wife and\ndaughter.  The abuse is of an emotional, physical, and sexual nature.   \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s case rested chiefly on the contents of the investigative report prepared\nby the Army CID in the Host Nation.  Applicant contends that this report was not admissible,\nbecause it contained statements adverse to Applicant without providing him the opportunity to cross-\n\nThe CID Command \u201cis the sole agency within the United States Army responsible for the investigation of\n2\nfelonies[.]\u201d Army Regulation (AR) 195-2, Criminal Investigation Activities, October 30, 1985, \u00b6 1-5(a).  The CID\nexercises the Army\u2019s investigative authority under \u00b6 3-1 of this regulation.\nAR 195-2 \u00b6 3-1.  In this regard, Applicant argues that an Army interest exists for investigative purposes \u201conly\u201d\n3\nwhere the circumstances fall in one of the five criteria in subparagraph 3-1b.\n  \nThe Board notes that, although Applicant was not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he was\n4\nsubject to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1361, which establishes extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction over persons serving with the Armed\nForces outside the United States.  This jurisdiction extends to Defense contractors.  The applicable Status of Forces\nAgreement provides that the U.S. military authorities have the right of criminal jurisdiction over, inter alia, \u201ccivilian\npersons . . . who are in the employ of, serving with, or accompanying the United States armed forces . .\u201d \n3\nexamine the makers of the statements.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22.   Applicant also argues that the CID\nreport did not satisfy the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, which permits the admission, without\nauthenticating witnesses, of \u201c[o]fficial records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course\nof business.\u201d  Regarding the latter argument, Applicant contends that the CID investigation was\noutside the scope of authority of the CID.   Applicant relies upon AR 195-2, apparently in effect at\n2\nthe time of Applicant\u2019s case, in its description of circumstances in which an Army interest in\ninvestigation will generally be said to exist.  These circumstances do not explicitly include those of\nApplicant.   However, the regulation does not limit CID investigative authority to those five criteria\n3\nset forth therein\u2013the language of the regulation is illustrative, not exhaustive.  Construing the\nregulation in its entirety, its plain meaning would include circumstances, such as these, where a\nholder of a security clearance is accused of committing felonies while accompanying the Armed\nForces overseas.  The record demonstrates that the PPS of State A, aware that Applicant was\noverseas working with the Army, notified DoD Family Advocacy officials in Arlington, VA of the\nwife\u2019s complaint.  DoD Family Advocacy, in turn, forwarded the information to Army officials in\nthe Host Nation.  Upon receipt, CID agents interviewed the wife in State A, interviewed Applicant\nin the Host Nation, and compiled the evidence in the investigative report at issue here.  This report\nstates that, prior to issuance, CID officials coordinated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and\nwith the office of the servicing Staff Judge Advocate.  The Board notes that federal agencies are\nentitled to a presumption of good faith and regularity in the performance of their responsibilities.\nSierra Club v. Costle, 657 F.2d 298, 334 (D.C. Cir. 1981); Broderick v. American General Corp.,\n71 F.2d 864, 869 (4  Cir. 1934); Glisson v. United States Forest Service, 876 F. Supp. 1016, 1023-4\nth\n(S.D. Ill 1993).  The record as a whole does not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has rebutted the\npresumption of good faith and regularity as regards the activities of the DoD or Army officials in his\ncase.  There is nothing on the face of the report or in its contents to suggest that it was not an official\nCID record or that it was prepared and maintained other than in the regular course of CID business.4\nTherefore, the report satisfied the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.   \nApplicant states that the report is not complete, insofar as some of the exhibits listed as\nattachments were not submitted into evidence at the hearing.  Applicant does not allege, nor does\nthe record suggest, that Department Counsel withheld relevant documents that were in his\n\n4\npossession.  A review of the list of these attachments, included in the CID report, provides no reason\nto conclude that any of them not admitted at the hearing were exculpatory or that, had they been\nadmitted, the Judge would have decided the case differently.   Accordingly, the Board resolves the\nassignment of error under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 adversely to Applicant. \nApplicant also cites Directive \u00b6 E3.1.22, which forbids the admission of oral or written\nstatements adverse to Applicant unless there is an opportunity for cross-examination.  However, as\nApplicant\u2019s brief acknowledges, this provision does not establish a blanket right of confrontation but,\nrather, is qualified by other provisions of the Directive.  See, for example ISCR Case 03-06770 at\n3-4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2004), which upheld a Judge\u2019s admission of a police report under \u00b6 E3.1.20,\ndespite the fact that the maker of the report was not available for cross examination.  The Board\nstated that \u201cDOHA proceedings are civil, administrative proceedings in which strict rules of evidence\nneed not be applied . . . [I]t is well-settled that hearsay evidence can be admitted and considered in\nfederal administrative proceedings, including security clearance adjudications\u201d (internal citations\nomitted).  The Board also stated that, in any event, police reports are admissible as an exception to\nthe hearsay rule, for example as public records under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 803(8).  See\nalso ISCR Case No. 98-0265 at 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 1999).  Because \u00b6 E3.1.22 does not require\nexclusion of statements that are admissible under \u00b6 E3.1.20 or as exceptions to the hearsay rule under\nthe FRE, and because the CID report was admissible as an official record under the Directive,\nApplicant was not denied a right of confrontation.     \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in the weight she assigned to the evidence contained\nin the CID report, insofar as it was hearsay and was, in Applicant\u2019s view, uncorroborated.  The Board\nhas considered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole, finding therein no basis to\nconclude that her weighing of the evidence was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law or that her\ndecision contravened the weight of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).   The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the\nchoice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The Judge\u2019s decision that \u201cit is not clearly in the interests of national security to grant\nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance\u201d is sustainable on this record.

In December 2002 Applicant and his family traveled to the U.S. to visit Applicant\u2019s parents. Toward the end of the visit, Applicant\u2019s wife insisted that they stay at a hotel rather than with the parents. Applicant checked his wife and daughter into a hotel, but he stayed with his parents. The next morning Applicant visited them, and, while he went to an ATM machine to get money, the wife and daughter checked out of the hotel. Applicant returned to the Host Nation and continued his employment for the defense contractor. Applicant stated at the hearing that he did not know where his family went, or where they had been since that day. In early 2003 he was informed by a representative of the local office of the Staff Judge Advocate that his wife had made allegations against him. These allegations were that Applicant had raped and assaulted his wife and that he had physically and sexually abused his daughter, and some of those alleged incidents occurred in the Host Nation where Applicant accompanied the Army. The Judge stated, in a footnote, that it \u201cis unnecessary to describe in detail the sexual conduct, other than to find the conduct was inappropriate and would constitute physical and sexual assaults and indecent acts with a child.\u201d Decision at 6. The wife and daughter were interviewed by the protective services system (PPS) of State A. PPS prepared a report, included as part of Government Exhibit 2, Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID) Report. The wife also filed for custody of the daughter, alleging physical and sexual abuse of the daughter as well as abandonment. The Judge\u2019s findings quote at length a signed, sworn statement by the wife describing abuse alleged to have been inflicted by Applicant upon the wife and daughter. The abuse is of an emotional, physical, and sexual nature. Department Counsel\u2019s case rested chiefly on the contents of the investigative report prepared by the Army CID in the Host Nation. Applicant contends that this report was not admissible, because it contained statements adverse to Applicant without providing him the opportunity to cross- The CID Command \u201cis the sole agency within the United States Army responsible for the investigation of 2 felonies[.]\u201d Army Regulation (AR) 195-2, Criminal Investigation Activities, October 30, 1985, \u00b6 1-5(a). The CID exercises the Army\u2019s investigative authority under \u00b6 3-1 of this regulation. AR 195-2 \u00b6 3-1. In this regard, Applicant argues that an Army interest exists for investigative purposes \u201conly\u201d 3 where the circumstances fall in one of the five criteria in subparagraph 3-1b.

He mitigated the security concerns under \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn April 22, 2008 and January 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines J, D, and B. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 6, 2008 and January 30, 2009, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge.1 The case was assigned to me \non January 22, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 10, 2009, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on March 9, 2009. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6. Applicant\u2019s attorney had no objections to GE 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6, \nbut objected to GE 2. I overruled the objection and all of the Government\u2019s exhibits were \nadmitted.2 The Government also requested administrative notice be taken of exhibits \nmarked as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through VI, which was granted. Applicant testified \nand offered Exhibits (AE) A through F. Department Counsel did not object and they \nwere admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 17, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in 1.a and 2.a of the SOR and admitted the \nallegations in 3.a and 3.b of the amended SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the \nallegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old network engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since 2000. He has resided in Korea since 1993, where he worked for a \ndifferent defense contractor before changing jobs to work for his present employer. \nApplicant explained that his job required him to work very long hours every day, six and \nsometimes seven days a week. He would normally work 10-12 hours each day.3  \n \nApplicant met his wife, who was from the Philippines, through a coworker, who \nwas married to her sister. Applicant and his wife dated for four months before being \nmarried in the Philippines in1995. He testified that his new brother-in-law warned him \nthat when he married a Filipina woman he essentially married the whole family and he \nwould be expected to provide financial support to her extended family in the Philippines. \nHe and his wife would return periodically to visit her family in the Philippines. He \nestimated that over a seven-year period he provided his wife\u2019s family approximately \n$200,000.4 Applicant stated that after he and his wife were married for about six months \nher personality changed and she became angry about nothing.5  \n \nApplicant stated his wife would return to the Philippines with her sister for months \nat a time to visit her family. He would visit periodically. He estimated that in the seven \n \n1 I have received letters that contain briefs and attached exhibits from Applicant\u2019s counsel dated \nFebruary 6, 2009, September 18, 2008 and June 18, 2008. I have considered all of these documents. \n \n2 Tr. 28-38. \n \n3 Tr. 75-81, 87, 89. \n \n4 AE B consists of two money orders, the amounts on them are illegible. \n \n5 Tr. 81-89, 112-113. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nyears they were married she spent about half of the time in the Philippines with her \nfamily.6 \n \nIn 1998 Applicant and his wife had a daughter. His wife gave birth in the \nPhilippines. He was present at the birth, but returned to his job in the Korea shortly \nthereafter and she remained in the Philippines for three months with their newborn \nbaby. When she returned back to Korea he continued to work long hours. He estimated \nhe only saw the baby about 30 minutes in the evening when he came home from work. \nHe spent time with her watching television, playing games, going to church and going to \nthe base.7  \n \nApplicant testified that after the baby was born his relationship with his wife \nchanged. He stated she wanted more money, so he gave her more money. He testified \nshe had access to his accounts. He paid all of the bills and gave her spending money. \nShe did not like to write checks or use the ATM so he gave her cash. The money he \ngave her was in addition to the money he stated he provided for her family. He \npurchased all of the \u201cbig ticket\u201d items they needed. He stated, \u201cI purchased all of the \nfood.\u201d He believed their main \u201cissue\u201d was financial. She would complain that he was not \nproviding enough support for her family. He stated \u201cI would give her money, but it wasn\u2019t \nenough.\u201d He stated \u201cI would work too late, she would call my boss and she\u2019d say \u2018well, \nyou know, when is he coming home.\u201d8 He stated she would hit him, be violent towards \nhim, and leave scratch marks on his face.9  \n \nApplicant testified he and his family went to the Philippines in 2000 to visit her \nfamily. He stayed for two to three weeks. They also visited Applicant\u2019s family in the U.S. \nwith their daughter when she was two.  \n \nIn December 2002, Applicant, his wife and their daughter traveled to the U.S. to \nvisit his parents. He stated his wife insisted they rent a car, even though his parents had \nvehicles, so she could travel to [State B]. He and his wife went to a local resort for a \nweek. They left their daughter with her grandparents before returning to his family\u2019s \nresidence. While at the resort Applicant stated they were approached about purchasing \na time share. He stated \u201cwe went there and we did and I actually ended up purchasing \nthe time share.\u201d10 He stated it was for him and his wife. Applicant provided the contract \nhe signed on December 19, 2002. It lists only Applicant as the holder of property and \nnot his wife as a joint owner.11 Applicant stated his wife was always on the phone with \n \n6 Tr. 87-88, 103. \n \n7 Tr. 90-95. \n \n8 Tr. 118. \n \n9 Tr. 96-100, 118. \n \n10 Tr. 116. \n \n11 AE D. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nher sister. He stated his daughter was happy spending time with her grandparents. \nApplicant testified that he thought his wife was concerned about his daughter spending \ntoo much time with her grandparents. On December 29, 2002, Applicant\u2019s wife would \nnot let his mother take their daughter to church. When he came home from church he \nfound his wife had packed their belongings and wanted to go to a hotel. Applicant \nobliged. He stated his wife was angry with him and had a violent demeanor.12 \n \nApplicant checked his family into a hotel on the night of December 29, 2002, but \nhe returned to his parents\u2019 residence. He denies he locked his wife in the room or \nprevented her from making phone calls, or restricted her freedom in anyway. He \nreturned to the hotel the next morning, December 30, 2002, and brought them \nbreakfast. He stated his wife was upset with him and told him \u201cthey were not \ncompatible\u201d. She wanted money so he gave her about $20 and told her he would go to \nthe bank. He left to go to the bank and stated he said \u201cI love you, [daughter].\u201d He \nreturned 30-40 minutes later and his wife and daughter were gone. The person at the \nhotel front desk told him they had checked out and he had Applicant\u2019s possessions. \nApplicant paid the hotel bill and returned to his parents.13 \n \nApplicant testified that the first thing he did when he returned to his parents\u2019 \nresidence was to contact the police department.14 He was advised because it was less \nthan 24 hours he could not file a missing persons report. He testified that he received a \ncall from the police sometime later while at his parents that the police had received an \nanonymous call explaining his wife and daughter were safe.15 Applicant stated \u201cI had no \nclue where they were.\u201d16 He left the next day, December 31, 2002, to return to Korea. \nHe had been on leave for 30 days and was required to report back to work.17  \n \nIn January 2003, weeks after he stated his wife and daughter left and he had no \nidea where they were, he filed an abandonment petition, the first step in the process to \nfile for divorce, in the state where his parents resided. He hired an attorney from the \nstate who advised him that he had to be separated from his wife for a year before they \ncould divorce. Applicant stated the divorce was uncontested and became final on April \n28, 2004. The notice of divorce was completed by publication. Applicant testified \u201cI am \nnot a person that wants divorce. I did not want a divorce.\u201d He went on to say \u201cI don\u2019t \n \n12 Tr. 114-123. \n \n13 Tr. 123-127. \n \n14 Tr. 127. \n \n15 Applicant\u2019s testimony is somewhat inconsistent with his sworn statement (GE 5) of December \n11, 2007. In the statement he indicated that he returned to Korea not knowing of his family\u2019s location. \nUpon his return he had a phone message from his brother-in-law advising him that his wife and daughter \nwere \u201cokay.\u201d \n \n16 Tr. 127. \n \n17 Tr. 128-129. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nbelieve in divorce. I was devastated that I had to do that. That I was forced into a \ndivorce because she abandoned me.\u201d18  \n \nApplicant\u2019s provided a sworn statement in December 2007. He stated the \nfollowing:  \n \nThere was never any contact between myself, wife or daughter. There \nwas never any child custody hearing or any discussion or settlement on \nfinancial matters. I was never obligated by the court to pay spousal or \nchild support nor was it ever demanded from me by my ex-wife. To my \nknowledge a child support complaint was never filed against me. After we \nseparated, I never paid spousal support or child support, primarily \nbecause I have not since December 2002 heard or seen my ex-wife or \ndaughter and have no knowledge as to where they currently reside.19 \n \n*** \n \nAbout a week after I filed for divorce in January [20]03, I was informed by \nthe Legal Office/JAG at [base] that my ex-wife had made allegations \nagainst me of sexual assault, molestation and rape. I later understood that \nthe [base] investigated these allegations. However, I was never arrested \nor criminally charged as a result of these allegations.  \n \n                                                         *** \n \nI believe that [my brother-in-law] had coordinated and orchestrated these \nallegations against me by way of military channels, which is the reason \n[the base] became involved. [My brother-in-law] was not only my ex-wife\u2019s \nbrother-in-law, but he was a former work associate and friend.  \n \n                                                         *** \n \nThe last time I spoke to [brother-in-law] was by way of telephone in \nNov[ember] [20]02 and the conversation was pleasant. [My brother-in-law] \nnever inferred to me or accused me directly of inappropriately touching or \ninstructing his son of anything of a sexual nature, or having raped his \nsister-in-law or having molested my daughter. I am not sure why [brother-\nin-law] became involved in this matter other than having thought or \nbelieved that he was assisting his wife and sister-in-law of doing the right \nthing. I need to emphasize that the investigation pertaining to these \nallegations at some point stopped, especially after [brother-in-law] was \nsupposed to have passed away in a hotel room in the Philippines in Jul[y] \n[20]03 due to a heart attack. However, I believe for whatever reason, that \n \n18 Tr. 135-138, 152-156, 202-207. \n \n19 GE 5 page 6. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n[brother-in-law] may have staged his own death. I understand that \n[brother-in-law] had accumulated a great deal of debt and was \nexperiencing financial problems. I think it\u2019s possible that [brother-in-law] is \nstill alive, living in the Philippines, but it\u2019s strictly speculation on my part. \n \n                                                       *** \n \nRegarding my daughter, about the time she had turned three years old, I \nhad suspicions about whether I was her biological father. I had suggested \nto my ex-wife about taking a paternity test but my ex-wife would not permit \nit. I felt that my ex-wife acted in such a way to lead me to think that [child] \nwas not my daughter. She made me feel that she did not want me to be \ninvolved in our daughter\u2019s life.20 \n \nApplicant testified that the JAG office notified him of the molestation charges and \nadvised him he had to appear in court in February 2002 in State A. Applicant stated he \nhired a lawyer in that state to represent him. He never personally appeared. He stated \nthe charges were dropped and nothing became of that particular proceeding. Applicant \nlater testified that these matters have never been addressed in a criminal court.21  \n \nOn January 11, 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife reported to a mental health professional in \nState A for treatment. Her daughter disclosed that Applicant had spanked her \nrepeatedly on numerous occasions and had demanded that she take her pants down \nwhenever she was going to receive a spanking. This was confirmed by her mother. \nApplicant\u2019s wife provided a photograph of one of the more severe beatings endured by \nher daughter. Based on this information a report was made to the state\u2019s abuse hotline. \nA child protective investigator and sheriff went to the wife\u2019s home and interviewed the \nchild alone. The child disclosed her father had also been sexually inappropriate with her \non numerous occasions.22 \n \nThe child attended sexual abuse therapy that also addressed the issues \nconcerning the physical violence. The child disclosed during the sessions that her father \ndid more than physically abuse her he also would touch her inappropriately with her \npants down. During each session the child would refer to her father as \u201cmean or angry.\u201d \nIt was determined by the mental health professional that the child had been physically \nand sexually abused.23 \n \n \n20 Tr. 131-148; GE 5. \n \n21 Tr. 133-134, 171. \n \n22 GE 2 exhibit 13. The specifics of the nature and extent of the inappropriate sexual contact and \nbehavior are included in this report. It is unnecessary to describe in detail the sexual conduct, other than \nto find the conduct was inappropriate and would constitute physical and sexual assaults and indecent \nacts with a child.  \n \n23 Id. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nA report from the [State] Protective Services System noted where Applicant\u2019s \nwife was living and that she is \u201cterrified of the father\u201d and \u201cthe father is not aware of the \nmother\u2019s current location.\u201d It noted that Applicant\u2019s wife alleged she was being \nphysically abused. Applicant\u2019s wife made a sworn statement on May 19, 2003, which \nalleged Applicant physically and sexually abused her. She stated: \n \nSince we have been married, [Applicant] had always been very controlling \nover our finances and day to day routines. I could not buy anything or do \nanything without his approval. Not very often and I can not tell you the \nexact dates, but occasionally, [Applicant] would twist my arm behind my \nback , push me against the wall or on the [couch], and on one specific \ntime, about year 2000, he hit me on my back with his fist. During this same \nincident, he choked me and pushed me on the [couch]. He was very angry \nand he never told me why he assaulted me and the reason why. I told \n[Applicant] that I wanted to call my sister [MM], who also lived in Korea, \nand ask for help. [Applicant] unplugged the phone and refused to allow me \nto talk with anyone. I never received any medical treatment because I did \nnot know how to contact the U.S. authorities on the military reservations. \nThe night that [Applicant] was choking me and hit me on the back, my \nsister had come to our house and she can witnessed that I had marks on \nmy neck. My sister asked if I had notified the Military Police and I stated \nthat I could not leave the house because he was prevented me from \nleaving and he had unplugged the telephone denying me to make \ntelephone calls. [Applicant] got down on his knees and begged my sister \nto not notify the authorities because he stated he did harm me. My sister \nstated she could see his hand impressions on my neck and he could not \ndeny that he had hurt me. He continued to beg my sister and she sat \ndown and talked with [Applicant] about the abuse. My sister never \nreported the incident to authorities. That night I slept in my daughter\u2019s \nbedroom to allow [Applicant] to cool off. I then begin to sleep with \n[Applicant] the following day.  \n \nFrom that day when he choked me, [Applicant] would mentally abuse my \ndaughter and me. For example, when my daughter and I wanted \nsomething, [Applicant] would intentionally not buy the item. I had no \naccess to the bank account or funds, and he was always the approving \nauthority for anything. Another example would be that [Applicant] would be \nallowed to eat steak at dinner and my daughter and I would only be \nallowed to eat rice. [Applicant] would also never allow me to have friends \nthat had an income from employment. I was only allowed to have \nacquaintances that were home moms only. I was also never allowed to get \na driver\u2019s license or drive, I was not permitted by [Applicant]. More \nimportantly, I was not allowed to work.  \n \n[Applicant] started physically abusing my daughter [name], when she was \nabout 2 1/2 or 3 years of age until he abandoned us in December [2000]. \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nHe would pull her hair, choke her, and hit her with an open hand reason \nfor unknown. He left marks and bruises on my daughter, but he refused \nher medical attention. All the physical abuse of my daughter and I were at \nour only residence in Korea.  \n \nAbout 5 Dec 03, [Applicant] told me that if I did not accompany him to the \nU.S. that I would never see my parents again nor see my daughter. My \ndaughter and I went to [State C] with [Applicant] to visit his family. About \n29 Dec 02, we were staying at the [hotel], [Applicant] looked at me and \nstated we are no longer compatible and abandoned my daughter and I at \nthe hotel with no money and no access to money. He also coordinated \nwith the hotel and ensured that I could not make any outside telephone \ncalls. I had no money for food for my daughter. I was so scared and I \ndidn\u2019t know what to do. I went to a local telephone booth and called a \nfriend for help who lived in State B. She called my sister in Korea and my \nsister then called me at the front desk at the hotel. My sister paid the bill at \nthe hotel and also sent me some money for food. My sister then called my \nniece in [State A] and she drove to [State C] and brought my daughter and \nI to [State A].  \n \nSince I arrived to [State A] I have been severely depressed and my \nniece\u2019s husband contacted his insurance company who referred me for \ntreatment to Mrs. G. I started receiving therapy from Mrs. G and disclosed \nthat my daughter was being physically abused by [Applicant]. My daughter \nwas then evaluated by Mrs. G and disclosed that she was physically and \nsexually abused by [Applicant]. I had no knowledge or did not notice any \nsign[s] was being sexually abused by [Applicant]. I have no details of the \nsexual abuse as my daughter disclosed this abuse to Mrs. G. I then \ndisclosed that I had been sexually assaulted by [Applicant] at our home in \nKorea from an unknown date in 1999 until we were abandoned in [State \nC].24 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife then explained she was raped by her husband approximately six \ntimes. She told him no and he grabbed her and threw her on the bed, forcefully \nremoved her clothes and then raped her. She never reported the rapes or physical \nabuse to law enforcement nor sought medical attention. She was scared for her \ndaughter\u2019s safety if she told anyone about any of the abuse. She alleged that it was \nApplicant who abandoned her and their daughter at the hotel and returned to his \noverseas job without notifying her.25  \n \n \n24 GE 2 at exhibit 10.  \n \n25 Id. \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nA Sexual Assault Medical Report from the County Child Protection Team \nconcluded the physical findings from their examination \u201cneither support or refute \nallegations of sexual abuse.\u201d26 \n \nApplicant provided a paid invoice showing that he paid for the hotel from \nDecember 29 to December 30, 2002. He also provided a statement from his mother. His \nmother\u2019s statement said that Applicant\u2019s daughter told her that she was supposed to \nstay with her mother. She also said that her uncle (Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law) told her \nthe child to tell everyone that Applicant was a bad man and he mentioned the word \n\u201cdivorce\u201d to her. Applicant\u2019s mother confronted Applicant\u2019s wife and she denied that her \nbrother-in-law said anything and that the child was manipulating her grandmother. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter is the only grandchild of his parents. The remainder of the \nstatement was consistent with Applicant\u2019s story. Applicant denies he physically or \nsexually assaulted his wife and daughter. \n \nIn March 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife filed for sole custody of their daughter in State F, \nalleging Applicant abandoned them and physically and sexually abused their daughter \nand physically abused her. Applicant\u2019s wife is not a U.S. citizen, but has a green card.27 \nApplicant testified the petition was denied. No supporting documentation was provided \nto substantiate the ruling. When asked why he did not appear in court to gain access to \nhis daughter, he stated he could not get off from work. He stated he was not granted \ncustody of his daughter. When asked who was granted custody, he stated \u201cI have no \nclue, sir.\u201d He has not filed an appeal in any court for custody of his child. Applicant \nstated he last contacted his attorney regarding the petition from his wife in State A in \n2003. He stated he wanted to see his daughter, but does not know where she is. When \nasked why he did not go back to the same Court in State A, he stated \u201cI haven\u2019t had the \nopportunity to go there.\u201d28  \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s testimony was troubling. Applicant has not seen his ex-wife \nor daughter since December 30, 2002. He has not taken any action to visit or obtain \ncustody of his daughter. He stated he does not know where his ex-wife and child are \nliving. He hired a private investigator in May 2003 to look for his wife and child. The \ndocuments he provided reflect some type of surveillance was conducted by a private \ninvestigator. The case was opened on May 13, 2003, and no other entries were noted \nafter June 3, 2003. He admitted he has done nothing else to find his ex-wife and \ndaughter. All of his court proceedings have been through an attorney. Applicant did not \nappear in court for his divorce or for the custody petition. He stated he could not take \ntime off from work to confront the issues against him in person.29 \n \n \n26 GE 2 at exhibit 11. \n \n27 AE C. \n \n28 Tr. 149-151.172-175, 234-236. \n \n29 Tr. 194 \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant testified he misses his daughter but does not know where she is \nlocated. However, he also admitted he has not looked for her at all. He has not \ncontacted his wife\u2019s attorney, or contacted her sister or made any other inquires. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has never requested or petitioned for spousal support or child \nsupport. She filed for divorce in 2008, unaware that Applicant\u2019s previous divorce petition \nwas granted in 2004. When asked why he did not go through the state where she filed \nfor divorce to attempt to find his child he stated: \u201cI have not had the opportunity.\u201d He \nadmitted that his ex-wife\u2019s divorce petition did not request spousal support, child \nsupport, or a division of property. When asked if he had saved any money for child \nsupport, Applicant stated he had saved $100,000 for his daughter\u2019s support and if he \ncould find her he would give it to her. He went on to say \u201cI am saddened by the fact that \nI cannot spend any time with her and be with her.\u201d30 He later stated that he had called \nthe phone number on the divorce papers from his ex-wife.31 I did not find Applicant\u2019s \nstatements credible. \n \nApplicant admitted he spanked his daughter, but not on her bare buttocks. He \nstated he worked very long hours, between 10 and 12 hours a day, six and seven days \na week. Applicant stated he never was alone with his daughter during her entire life. He \nstated he never changed one of her diapers. He stated he and his wife potty trained \ntheir daughter, but he was never alone with her.32  \n \nApplicant was investigated and questioned by military authorities in Korea, \nbeginning in 2003. He denied he abused his wife and daughter. He refused to take a \npolygraph on the advice of his lawyer. Applicant was never charged with a criminal \noffense.33  \n \nAt his hearing Applicant suggested an explanation for his daughter\u2019s allegations. \nHe was made aware by his brother-in-law sometime between 2000 and 2002, when \nApplicant\u2019s daughter was visiting with her mother\u2019s relatives in the Philippines, that there \nwas a domestic worker who had a brother in the area. Applicant learned that this \nbrother had molested an eight-year-old female relative of his wife\u2019s family. Applicant \ncould not clearly remember when he was told about this person nor could he remember \nwhen the alleged abuse by this brother took place, but believed it was around 2000 \nwhen he learned of it. Applicant stated \u201cit is very possible that this boy did the \nmolesting\u201d of his daughter. Applicant admitted he never mentioned this \u201cpotential \nsuspect\u201d to any of the investigators during the course of the investigation. He stated \n \n30 Tr. 244. \n \n31 Tr. 160, 196, 242. \n \n32 Tr. 134-135, 156. \n \n33 Tr. 43-71. There are many reasons why some cases are not criminally prosecuted. In this case \nI do not have any statement or document as to why these alleged offenses were not pursued. The Korean \nauthorities declined to prosecute. At the time of the allegations, the wife and child were no longer living in \nKorea. There are likely concerns about difficult international jurisdictional issues and the potential \nadditional trauma to an alleged child victim.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \n\u201cthat\u2019s something I left out.\u201d34 It is unclear how Applicant\u2019s daughter, at the age of two \nwould confuse this boy with her father or could articulate how she was molested. This \nwas the first time Applicant mentioned this \u201cpotential suspect.\u201d I did not find Applicant\u2019s \ntheory credible.35 \n \nApplicant believes his wife\u2019s motivation for making these accusations is because \nshe told him she would ruin his life if he did not do everything she wanted and this is a \nway to ruin him. This appears inconsistent with Applicant\u2019s \u201cpotential suspect\u201d theory.36 \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. He stated Applicant\u2019s wife would \ncall where they worked, sometimes multiple times during a day. He observed Applicant \nhad scratches on his face. He did not socialize with Applicant. He stated Applicant \ndiscussed that his wife was always demanding money and spending it on her extended \nfamily. The witness stated \u201cno other man was more devoted to his family, but he had to \nprovide the highest standard of living.\u201d He confirmed that he would have approved \nApplicant\u2019s leave request to go look for his daughter. Such a request was never made.37  \n \n \nApplicant met a woman over the internet from the Philippines in approximately \nApril 2005. She is now his girlfriend. He visits her over long weekends when possible. \nThey speak on the phone or text message daily. He has been sending her \napproximately $150 a month since January 2006. When visiting her in the Philippines \nthey meet at a hotel. He does not know her home address because she has moved. He \ndoes not pay for her living arrangements. He is aware that she has two brothers and a \nsister, but has never been introduced to them and he does not know how they are \nemployed. She is employed as a seamstress at a factory. He previously had planned to \nmarry her, but has since changed his mind and is not sure. He last visited her for a \nweek over the holidays in December 2008. She is aware that Applicant works in Korea, \nbut does not know the nature of his job. Applicant stated that if his girlfriend made \ninquires about his job he would leave her.38 \n \n \nI have considered all of the testimony and all of the documentary evidence from \nboth parties, including the character letters provided.  \n \nPhilippines \n \n \nThe Philippines has a representative democracy modeled on the U.S. System. \nThe 1987 constitution reestablished a presidential system of government with a \nbicameral legislature and an independent judiciary. The government continues to face \n \n34 Tr. 167. \n \n35 Tr. 105-111, 157-158, 165-168, 222. \n \n36 Tr. 241. \n \n37 Tr. 269-308. \n \n38 Tr. 180 188, 190-192, 241. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n                                                          \nthreats from terrorist groups. The terrorist groups have gained international notoriety \nwith their kidnapping of foreign tourists in the southern islands. This remains a major \nproblem of the government. U.S. troops advise, assist and train Philippine soldiers in \ncounterterrorism. In 2006, the armed forces of the Philippines began a major offensive \nagainst these terrorist groups which was remarkably successful.  \n \n \n\u201cThe U.S. and Philippine relations are based on shared history and commitment \nto democratic principles, as well as on economic ties. The historical and cultural links \nbetween the Philippines and the U.S. remain strong. The Philippines modeled its \ngovernment institutions on those of the U.S. and continues to share a commitment to \ndemocracy and human rights. At the most fundamental level of bilateral relations, \nhuman links continue to form a strong bridge between the two countries. There are an \nestimated four million Americans of Philippine ancestry in the United States, and more \nthan 250,000 American citizens in the Philippines.\u201d39  \n \n \nSince 1992, U.S. and Philippine relations have improved and broadened, with a \nprominent focus on economic and commercial ties while maintaining the importance of \nthe security dimension. U.S. investment continues to play an important role in the \nPhilippine economy, with a strong security relationship.40  \n \n \n\u201cNearly 400,000 Americans visit the Philippines each year. Providing government \nservices to U.S. and other citizens, therefore, constitutes an important aspect of the \nbilateral relationship. Those services include veterans\u2019 affairs, social security, and \nconsular operations. Benefits to Filipinos from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \nand the Social Security Administration totaled approximately $330 million dollars in \n2007. Many people-to-people programs exist between the U.S. and the Philippines, \nincluding Fulbright, International Visitors, and Aquino Fellowship exchange programs, \nas well as the U.S. Peace Corps.\u201d41 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n \n39 HE I through VI. \n \n40 Id. \n \n41 U.S. State Department Background Note: Philippines, October 2008. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern pertaining to sexual behavior:  \n \nSexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information.  \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b613 that could raise a \nsecurity concern including the following: \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \nThere is evidence to support that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and daughter were \nphysically and sexually abused by Applicant. A child protective investigator interviewed \nApplicant\u2019s daughter alone and she disclosed her father had been sexually \ninappropriate with her on numerous occasions. It was also disclosed that he had \nspanked her on her bare buttocks. A mental health professional employed by State A \nconcluded Applicant\u2019s child had been physically and sexually abused. I find all of the \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 to include the \nfollowing: \n \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress, and \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n \n \nMany of Applicant\u2019s explanations and theories I did not find credible. Applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion and he failed to provide persuasive evidence to \nconclude any of the above mitigating conditions apply. There is documentary evidence \nbased on interviews with the child and sworn statements from Applicant\u2019s ex-wife that \nsubstantiate physical and sexual abuse were perpetrated on them by Applicant. His \ntheory about a \u201cpotential suspect\u201d was not raised until his hearing which raises \n\n \n15 \n \n \nquestions about his credibility. There clearly are discrepancies between Applicant\u2019s \nstory and his ex-wife\u2019s. Applicant claimed his ex-wife always wanted more money and \nwas never satisfied. He believed his ex-wife was out to ruin him. Beyond her initial \ncomplaint to state authorities there is no other evidence she pursued these allegations \nagainst him through the legal system to ruin him. If she was dissatisfied with their \nfinancial situation and always wanted more money as alleged by Applicant, it is unclear \nwhy she did not pursue any spousal and child support. This is inconsistent with \nApplicant\u2019s theory she wanted more money and was attempting to ruin him. Applicant \nadmittedly has not pursued any type of visitation with his daughter. He has made a \nnominal effort to find them. He began the divorce process weeks after he stated they \nabandoned him and he had no idea where they were located.  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern regarding criminal conduct: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nto willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant physically and sexually \nassaulted his wife and daughter. The specific information is the same as was discussed \nunder Guideline D, Sexual Behavior. I find disqualifying conditions (a) and (c) apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that may mitigate the security concerns. I have \nconsidered them all and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) so much time has elapses since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are not longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. The \ndiscussion addressed under Guideline D, Sexual Behavior, is applicable under the \nCriminal Conduct allegations. I conclude there is sufficient evidence to find Applicant \ncommitted the offenses alleged and he failed to meet his burden of persuasion in \nmitigation.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \nApplicant has a girlfriend in the Philippines. He has regular contact with her. She \nis a factory worker. He visits her during vacations and long weekends when he can. His \ncontact with her does not create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. There is a strong U.S. presence in the Philippines. \nAlthough there are terrorist threats in the Philippines, the U.S. has long been an ally. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend does not create a potential conflict of interest \n\n \n17 \n \n \nbetween his obligation to protect sensitive information and his desire to help his \ngirlfriend. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions and conclude none apply.  \nIn an abundance of caution, I have also analyzed all of the facts and considered \nall of the mitigating conditions for this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests. \n \n \nApplicant has a girlfriend in the Philippines. He visits her when he has the time. \nShe is a factory worker. The U.S. and the Philippines are allies and have had strong \ninternational ties for decades. Applicant has worked as a U.S. contractor overseas since \n1993. His relationship with his girlfriend is more than casual, but there is nothing to \nsuggest that Applicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between his \ngirlfriend and the interests of the U.S. This is equally true for any conflict of interest that \nmay arise. Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty and obligation would clearly outweigh any \nconflict and he would clearly be expected to resolve such in favor of the U.S. I find \nunder the facts of this case, if a disqualifying condition did apply it would be mitigated \nunder both (a) and (b). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n18 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has worked for a defense \ncontractor overseas for many years. He has a good work record. The allegations of \nsexual and physical abuse to both his ex-wife and daughter are substantiated by the \ndocumentary evidence. Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion to refute the \nallegations. The allegations are of a serious nature. The nature of the allegations clearly \ncould create the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress. Applicant\u2019s \ntheories did not rise to the level of refuting the allegations. I found much of his testimony \nnot credible or believable. I have considered all of the evidence for both sides and \nconclude Applicant did not meet his heavy burden.  \n \nWith regard to the allegations under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, I considered \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend in the Philippines and the United State\u2019s \nrelationship with the Philippines. There is nothing to lead me to believe that Applicant \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in any way other than for the U.S. The mere fact \nthat he has a girlfriend in the Philippines does not create a heightened risk for foreign \nexploitation, manipulation, pressure or coercion. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the sexual \nbehavior and criminal conduct guidelines. Applicant has met his burden regarding the \nsecurity concerns arising under the foreign influence guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph  2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n19 \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

I make the following findings: Applicant is a 41-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since January 2006 (Government Exhibit (GX) 2 at 17). He was married in June 1988, and has three children, ages 18, 17, and 12. Applicant served in the U.S. Army from June 1984 to June 1988 and was honorably discharged. He received a clearance in February 1985, while in the Army. He received a clearance as a government contractor in June 1989 (GX 1 at 31-32). Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked in October 2003, and his employment with a federal contractor was terminated because a clearance was a condition of employment. The revocation of his clearance was based on the three events alleged in the SOR. He applied for restoration of his clearance in September 2005. The SOR alleges that in 2000 and 2001, Applicant installed personal software on his work computer and took software from his work computer for use on his personal computer (SOR \u00b61.a.1). Applicant had an unclassified stand-alone personal computer configured to monitor and manage several dial-up modems.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nDuring 2000 and 2001, Applicant downloaded personal software onto his company computer,\nand he copied some games from his company computer for use on his personal computer at home.\nOn several occasions between 1992 and 2000, he borrowed 50 to 75 cents from an informal soda\nfund, and he took $15 on one occasion.  When he filed an insurance claim for an auto accident, he\nwas assured by passengers in his car that he had obeyed a stop sign, but he did not tell his insurance\ncompany he could not personally remember whether he stopped.  He refuted the allegation of\ndeceiving his insurance company and mitigated security concerns based on his computer misuse and\ntaking money from the soda fund.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under E (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 13, 2007, denied some allegations and\nadmitted some, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on\nAugust 15, 2007, and heard as scheduled on September 13, 2007.  I kept the record open until\nSeptember 21, 2007, to enable Applicant to submit additional evidence.  I received his evidence on\nSeptember 19, 2007, and it was admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) B. DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on September 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 41-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since January 2006 (Government Exhibit (GX) 2 at 17).  He was married in June\n1988, and has three children, ages 18, 17, and 12.\nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from June 1984 to June 1988 and was honorably\ndischarged.  He received a clearance in February 1985, while in the Army.  He received a clearance\nas a government contractor in June 1989 (GX 1 at 31-32).\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked in October 2003, and his employment with a\nfederal contractor was terminated because a clearance was a condition of employment.  The\nrevocation of his clearance was based on the three events alleged in the SOR.  He applied for\nrestoration of his clearance in September 2005.\nThe SOR alleges that in 2000 and 2001, Applicant installed personal software on his work\ncomputer and took software from his work computer for use on his personal computer (SOR  \u00b61.a.1).\nApplicant had an unclassified stand-alone personal computer configured to monitor and manage\nseveral dial-up modems.  He testified there were no formal rules governing his use of his stand-alone\ncomputer (Tr. 30).  He admitted installing a streaming music player on this computer without\nauthorization and copying games from his work computer and installing them on his personal\ncomputer at home.  He also admitted installing his personal email account on his work computer,\ninstalling software for a personal business site, and periodically checking his personal email at work.\nHe admitted downloading management software for the modems but asserted he had verbal\nauthorization for the download (Tr. 32).\n\n4\nThe SOR also alleges Applicant took money for personal use, in amounts up to $15 at a time,\nbetween 1992 and 2000, from an informal soda fund operated by his coworkers (SOR \u00b6 1.a.2).  He\nadmitted borrowing 50 or 75 cents at a time, on no more than ten occasions, to make purchases from\na vending machine.  He admitted taking $15 from the fund on one occasion when he paid for parking\nin connection with official business.  He stated his two colleagues refused to share the cost of the\nparking.  He asked for reimbursement from the \u201cfront office,\u201d but when he was told there was no\npetty cash fund, he took $15 from the soda fund to reimburse himself (Tr. 47).  \nApplicant never disclosed to his coworkers that he was borrowing money from the fund.  He\ntestified he often put more money into the fund than the price of items he used, and he believed his\nperiodic overpayments were sufficient to cover the sums he took from time to time.  However, he\nadmitted he never reimbursed the fund for the $15 and never told his colleagues about it (Tr. 65).\nFinally, the SOR alleges Applicant deliberately left out unfavorable facts from a claim he\nsubmitted to his insurance company (SOR \u00b6 1.a.3).  In December 2001, Applicant was involved in\nan auto accident in a grocery store parking lot.  He testified he could not personally remember if he\nstopped at a stop sign, but his wife and three children with him in the car assured him he had\nstopped.  He did not tell the insurance company he could not personally remember if he stopped (Tr.\n33-36).  After he received reimbursement checks from both his insurance company and the other\ndriver\u2019s insurance company, he returned the check he received from his own insurance company (Tr.\n36).  He denied lying to his insurance company (Tr. 37).\nApplicant submitted evidence of his insurance claim history for the past five years.  It reflects\nthree claims: a towing claim in December 2002 and a glass loss in December 2004, both of which\nwere not Applicant\u2019s fault; and one claim in October 2004, when Applicant rear-ended another\nvehicle and was determined to be at fault (AX B at 13).\nThe allegations in the SOR were based entirely on Applicant\u2019s admissions during a polygraph\ninterview triggered by his application to upgrade his clearance.  The evidence provided by Applicant\nin response to DOHA interrogatories reflects that the initial decision to revoke his clearance was\nbased on the versions of Guideline M (Misuse of Information Technology Systems) and Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct) in effect at the time.  Applicant appealed the revocation decision, and the\nGuideline M security concerns were resolved in his favor, but the decision to revoke his clearance\nwas upheld under Guideline E.  The appellate decision does not state whether any of the allegations\nunder Guideline E were resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nAt the hearing, Applicant expressed embarrassment and regret for his behavior.  He testified\nhe has learned from his experience and now pays for everything out of pocket.  He testified, \u201cIf I\ncan\u2019t afford it, I don\u2019t have it.\u201d  He takes nothing from the common work area and often pays for his\nown office supplies (Tr. 57-58).\nA former co-worker, colleague, and personal friend of Applicant who has known him for 12\nyears described Applicant as having excellent judgment, ethical behavior, and honesty while working\nin classified environments.  He stated Applicant received numerous spot awards and certificates of\nappreciation from multiple customers while working on classified projects (AX A).\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s latest performance appraisal, dated January 16, 2007, gave him the top rating of\n\u201csuperior\u201d in quality of work, creativity, quantity of work, initiative, attendance and punctuality, and\nattitude/attentiveness.  He received the next highest rating of \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d in all other\nperformance categories.  His overall rating was \u201csuperior.\u201d  His rating official wants to make him\na supervisor.  GX 2 at 17-18.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n\n6\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cConduct involving questionable judgment,\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  AG \u00b6 15.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.3, alleging Applicant deliberately left out unfavorable details in his insurance\nclaims, is not supported by substantial evidence.  The evidence shows Applicant believed, based on\nassurances from his wife and three children, that he stopped at the stop sign.  His failure to disclose\nthat he could not personally remember stopping was not a material omission.  There is no evidence\nof deception or fraud.  I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a.3 in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nThe evidence supporting the remaining two allegations raise the following disqualifying\nconditions under this guideline:\nAG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that\nis not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when\nconsidered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3) and (4) are raised by \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly\ncovered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination,\nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information,\u201d including \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations\u201d and\n\u201cevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or resources.\u201d\nFinally, AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is raised by \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about\none's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . .\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community\nstanding.\u201d \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d)(3), (d)(4), and (e)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe offense is so minor,\nor so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(c).  Applicant\u2019s misuse of his company computer was\nminor and last occurred in 2001.  His unauthorized borrowing of small amounts from the soda fund\nand one-time theft of $15 were petty crimes, but they were not infrequent and they were significant\n\n7\nbreaches of his colleagues\u2019 trust.  However, they last occurred in 2000.  I conclude this mitigating\ncondition is only partially established.\nSecurity concerns also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the\nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate\nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(d).  Applicant has acknowledged and\nexpressed remorse for his misconduct.  His career took a serious setback when he disclosed it.  He\nhas learned his lesson and now buys only what he can afford out-of-pocket.  I am satisfied his\nmisconduct is unlikely to recur.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is established.\nFinally, security concerns can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe individual has taken positive\nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d  AG \u00b6 17(e).\nApplicant voluntarily disclosed his misconduct during his polygraph interview, admitted it in\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, admitted it in his answer to the current SOR, and admitted it at\nthe hearing.  I conclude AG \u00b6 17(e) is established.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors were discussed above, but some merit further comment.\nApplicant held a clearance during his Army service and from June 1989 to October 2003.\nHis misuse of his company computer occurred in a loosely-controlled environment.  His misuse of\nhis computer, unauthorized borrowing from the soda fund, and petty theft of $15 cost him his\nclearance and his job and severely limited his opportunity for advancement.  He appears to have\nlearned his lesson, and there is no record of any misconduct since 2001.  Notwithstanding his career\nsetback, he worked hard and performed well, to the extent that his current supervisor would like to\nmake him a supervisor.  He was remorseful, sincere, candid, and credible at the hearing.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the allegation\nin SOR \u00b6 1.a.3, and mitigated the security concerns based on the remaining allegations.  Accordingly,\nI conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E (Personal Conduct):\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n8\nSubparagraphs 1.a.1-1.a.3:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance for Applicant.

Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s finding of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record. Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.32.1. \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\n\nDecision at 2.\n2\nDecision at 3.\n3\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM), Item 3 at 1, 11-15.\n4\n3\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607,\n621, 86 S. Ct. 1018, 16 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1966)).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s finding, we are required to\ngive deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nIn his findings of fact, the Judge states that: \u201cThe settlement agreement is unsigned and\nApplicant provided no evidence that shows he has made any payments.\u201d   The Judge reiterates this\n2\nfinding in his conclusion, stating: \u201cHe submitted no evidence to establish the settlement with\nNMEAF was formalized or that he is making payments.\u201d   Applicant argues that these findings are\n3\nerroneous and are a product of the Judge\u2019s misinterpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant\u2019s\nargument has merit.\nApplicant acknowledges that the copy of the settlement agreement which he attached to his\nAnswer is the unsigned version.  However, Applicant points out that he stated in his Answer to the\nSOR that the accounts with NMEAF had been brought current, and attached copies of February 9,\n2006, March 31, 2006, and April 29, 2006 letters from NMEAF which stated that Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a special payment arrangement had been approved.  These letters also described\nApplicant\u2019s monthly payment plan and schedule with the NMEAF under the agreement.  They were\noffered as evidence by the Government as part of its case, and there was no objection from the\nApplicant.   \n4\nApplicant\u2019s payment  plan with the NMEAF provided for a forbearance period, and stated\nthat Applicant\u2019s first payment was due May 15, 2006.  Applicant\u2019s credit report, dated June 22,\n2006, indicates that Applicant may have made at least one payment under the plan.  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s finding that there is no evidence Applicant was making payments under the plan is\nerroneous.  The Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant had submitted no evidence to establish the\nsettlement with NMEAF was formalized is also erroneous.  However, these errors are harmless\nbecause the Judge was not required to conclude, as a matter of law, that Applicant had mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns, based upon the record that was before him.\n   \nWhether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\nAppeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security\nclearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review\nunder this standard is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative\nJudge.  We review matters of law de novo.\n\n4\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by\nhis history of financial difficulties had not been mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant\nargues that his unpaid debts are not recent, that they had resulted from circumstances beyond his\ncontrol, and were therefore isolated incidents.  He also argues that he has initiated a good-faith effort\nto pay off the debts he acknowledges and is disputing the others.  The Board does not find these\narguments persuasive.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the\ntrier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the financial considerations allegations had not been mitigated.  Although Applicant strongly\ndisagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  Moreover, the Board has previously noted\nthat it is reasonable to expect applicants to have documentation about efforts to satisfy specific debts.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-23511 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006). \nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant still had approximately\n$22,000 in unpaid debts for medical expenses, and almost $14,000 in unpaid debts for education\nloans for which he had only recently negotiated a repayment plan.  Regarding his medical debts,\nApplicant had documented the payment of only one small debt in the amount of $40.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still\nongoing.  See ISCR Case No. 03-26213 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2006).  The Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying\nconduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge\narticulated a rational basis for not applying the mitigating conditions in this case, and reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at\n4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable\nclearance decision under Guideline F is sustainable.\n\n5\n \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

As required by Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R (Jan.\n1987), as amended (Regulation), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2 (Jan. 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 17, 2006\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Regulation. In a sworn statement dated October 11, 2006,\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations. Applicant elected to have her case decided on the\nwritten record. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM)\non January 23, 2007. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on January 27, 2007, and received on\nFebruary 2, 2007. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant provided additional information and it was received\non March 5, 2007. Department Counsel had no objections. The case was assigned to me on March\n14, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 36-year-old single female who works for a medical contractor for the federal\ngovernment. Applicant listed on her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) that prior to her\npresent employment, which began on November 29, 2004, she was employed steadily, with no\nperiods of unemployment, since January 27, 1992. In her answer to the FORM, Applicant stated she\nhad periods of unemployment and was forced to resign from a job due to medical issues, sometime\nafter July 25, 2002. She stated once she recovered from her injuries she looked for a job and was\nhired on April 12, 2004. She left that employment to take the job with her present employer in\nNovember 2004. She also listed that from October 1, 2001, until the present she lived at the same\naddress. Applicant stated in her answer to the FORM that when she moved from State A to State B\nin May 2001, she \u201clived with relatives and friends for the first few years until 2004.\u201d She now has\nher own permanent residence. She listed only one residence on her SF 85P from October 2001 to the\npresent. \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1. a and claimed it is a duplicate of \u00b6 1. c. The debt was\ncharged off in February 2000. The debt is a judgment that was filed in September 2000. She stated\nshe never received notice. She recently contacted the creditor and updated her current address. The\ncreditor originally wanted full payment and would not accept a payment plan. However, the creditor\nagreed in June 2006 to accept monthly payments of $200 beginning in July. Applicant stated she\nmade three payments but has not provided verification of these payments.  \n1\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a debt that Applicant stated she paid prior to leaving State A. She failed to keep\na record of her payment, claimed she recently contacted them to provide her new address and was\ngoing to \u201ctry to work out a payment plan with them.\u201d  No documentation was provided. \n2\n\nId.\n3\nResponse to Form received March 5, 2007. \n4\nGE 3.\n5\nThe information in this paragraph is from Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM, March 5, 2007. \n6\n4\nSOR \u00b6 1. d is a debt to retail store credit card. Applicant contacted the creditor to provide a\ncurrent address. She stated she sent money to her mother to pay the debt. She also stated she would\nrepay the debt within one year.  No further documentation was provided to show any payments have\n3\nbeen made. This debt was charged off in February 2001. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f and 1.i are all from the same creditor and are for overdrafts and credit\ncard loans. These three debts were charged off in May, June and November 2001 respectively.\nApplicant has contacted the creditor and stated she would have payments deducted from her pay\nstarting in August 2006. No proof of payments were provided. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is an account from a retail store. She stated she had paid it off, but\nlater found out more was owed. She settled and repaid the debt with two payments completed in\nNovember 2006.  The debt was originally sent to collection in September 2001. It appears that this\n4\nis the same debt as listed in SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1. h, Applicant claims is the same as in \u00b6 1. b, but provided no proof of\nthe duplication or that it is paid. Applicant admits to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j, but disputes the amount.\nNo proof of resolution was provided. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1. k was placed for collection in March 2006. Applicant does not\nrecognize the creditor. No proof of resolution was provided. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m was for\ndelinquent state taxes for tax year 2001. She repaid this debt.5\nApplicant stated that she sent her mother, who was living in State A, money to pay some of\nher creditors, after she had left the state. Applicant had periods of unemployment. She returned to\nState A from approximately June 16, 2002 to July 2002, because her father died and she tended to\nher mother. She did not provide any information as to what actions she took to research her debts\nwhile she was in State A. Applicant was in a car accident on July 25, 2002, and suffered injuries that\ncaused her to miss work for over a year. In May 2006, her car was stolen and totaled and she incurred\nthe expense of towing and dumping the vehicle.  \n6\nApplicant stated:\n\u201cI admit that I have bills, but was not aware that they were delinquent because I had\nfailed to update the billers with my most current address information. Therefore, my\nmail had continued to go to my [State A] address, where my mother resides, since I\nhad no permanent address yet established in [State B] at the time. However, I did\n\nGE 3 at p. 1.\n7\nResponse to Form received March 5, 2007. \n8\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n9\nRegulation \u00b6 C2.1.2.\n10\nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.\n11\nRegulation \u00b6 C3.1.2.2.\n12\nRegulation \u00b6C6.1.1.1.\n13\n5\ncontinue to send money to my mother to help pay for my bills and it never occurred\nto me then that my bills continued to be outstanding.\u201d7\nApplicant also stated that she paid some bills but did not keep the documentation to substantiate her\nclaim. She stated that with regard to sending money to her mother she can produce her personal\nchecks as proof, but did not do so.  She did not provide any information from her mother that such\n8\nan arrangement had been made and her mother took over the responsibility for paying Applicant\u2019s\nbills. In response to question 20 on her SF 85P that inquired whether Applicant had any debts that\nwere delinquent for more than 180 days, she answered \u201cno.\u201d  Many of Applicant\u2019s debts were in a\ncharged off status prior to her moving. I do not find Applicant\u2019s statements to be credible and find\nshe deliberately and intentionally failed to provide accurate information on her SF 85P.\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines set out in the Regulation are used to make ADP trustworthiness\ndeterminations. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures\ncontained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.9\nAn individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security\nauthority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to do so.  Positions\n10\ndesignated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.  ADP III positions are\n11\n\u201cnonsensitive positions.\u201d  However, DOHA has been directed to apply the due process provisions\n12\nof the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III\npositions by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and\nSecurity) dated November 19, 2004. Thus, even though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are\ntreated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II\ncases. \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for \u2026 assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \u2026assigning\nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d  Appendix\n13\n8 of the Regulation sets forth adjudicative policy , as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and\n\nRegulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.\n14\nRegulation Appendix 8 at 132.\n15\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n16\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n17\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the adjudicative procedures contained in the Directive.14\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d  Each eligibility\n15\ndetermination  must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Regulation.\nSpecifically these are: the nature, extend, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of\nparticipation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the\nmotivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n16\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n17\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an\n18\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n19\ndecision.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\n20\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n21\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n22\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n23\n\nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n24\n7\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an\n24\nindication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nBased upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nFinancial Considerations-a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to\nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.\nPersonal Conduct-a security concern exists when conduct involving questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate\nthat the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below. \nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1 (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) and FC DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\napply in this case. Applicant has accumulated delinquent debts over a significant period of time, that\nshe has not paid. She moved from State A in May 2001. Many of her debts were delinquent prior to\nher move. Some were delinquent subsequent to her move. Most of her debts remain unpaid and\nunresolved. \nI considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and especially\nconsidered FC MC 1 (the behavior was not recent), FC MC 2 (it was an isolated incident), FC MC\n3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation)), FC MC 4 (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 6 (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent because most of them have not been paid or are unresolved.\nDue to the number of debts they are not isolated. Therefore, FC MC 1 and 2 do not apply. \n\n8\nMany of Applicant\u2019s debts were charged off or put in a collection status prior to her move.\nApplicant did have significant events occur in her life that were beyond her control, such as her father\npassing away, a car accident that caused her injuries, unemployment, and her car being stolen.\nHowever, these all occurred after she moved and after her debts were already delinquent. They\ncertainly impacted her ability to repay her debts, but the fact is she had not addressed any of the debts\nprior to the SOR being issued and prior to her misfortune. She has been steadily working since\nNovember 2004, but did not address her delinquent debts. Therefore, I find FC MC 3 does not apply.\nApplicant has not provided evidence she is receiving financial counseling nor are there clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved. She has paid two debts and made promises to pay\nothers. She claimed she was repaying or would begin repaying certain debts, but failed to provide\nproof of her payments. Applicant has contacted the creditors, but there is not a clear indication that\nher debts are being resolved or that she has initiated a good faith effort to repay her debts. Applicant\ndid not provide  documentation to show she has made payments to creditors she claimed she was\nrepaying or was planning on repaying. Therefore, I am unable to apply FC MC 4 or 6.\nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 2 (the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness determination) applies. Appellant deliberately and intentionally falsified\nher SF 85P by failing to list she had delinquent debts. It is not credible to believe that when she filled\nout her trustworthiness application in December 2004, that she did not believe she had any overdue\ndebts. She admitted that she had bills when she left State A in May 2001, but then says she did not\nknow they were delinquent because she failed to provide a current address to her creditors. Her debts\nwere charged off in January 2000, July 2000, September 2000 (a judgment was entered), February\n2001, May 2001, June 2001, and June 2006 (two accounts). The other debts were sent to collection\nin November 2001 (two accounts), April 2004, and March 2006. It is not credible to believe she was\nunaware of her delinquent debts. When debts are charged off it is usually after creditors have\nexhausted their attempts to get the debtor to repay the debt. Those attempts would have occurred prior\nto Applicant leaving the state. The fact she failed to provide a forwarding address raises issues. If she\nwas aware that she had debts, she also had a responsibility to provide the creditors with an address.\nApplicant claims she gave her mother money to repay her debts. She obviously was in contact with\nher mother during this time and had a responsibility to follow through on ensuring the debts were\nrepaid. She failed to provide any evidence from her mother to support an arrangement with her mother\nto repay all of her debts. It is not credible to believe that Applicant left State A totally unaware that\nshe had any delinquent debts considering many were delinquent and in a charged off status prior to\nher departure. I find Applicant was aware she had debts and they were delinquent before she moved\nand deliberately failed to list them on her SF 85P. \nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 2 (the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual\nhas subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), PC MC 3 (the individual made prompt,\ngood-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts), PC MC 5 (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure) and find they do not apply. I find that the falsification is recent because it\nhas to do with her trustworthiness application. The falsification occurred on Applicant\u2019s SF 85P.\n\n9\nHowever, Applicant continues to maintain she was unaware of the delinquent debts despite the\nevidence. There is no evidence Appellant voluntarily provided the correct information before being\nconfronted with the facts. Applicant has not provided any evidence that she has taken positive steps\nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion or pressure. After considering all of the evidence, I\nfind that Applicant knew when she filled out the SF 85P that she had some delinquent debts and she\nfailed to reveal them as required. I find PC MC 1, 3 and 5 do not apply. \nThe Whole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating  Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. I considered Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment and steady\nemployment since 2004. I considered what actions she took to resolve and repay her delinquent debts\nprior to the SOR and subsequent to it. She has paid two debts and apparently has an arrangement to\nrepay another, although she did not provide proof that she has continued to repay the debt. She\npromises to repay certain others. I considered the misfortunes that have occurred in her life. I also\nconsidered the dates of the delinquent debts and that many were years old and were not addressed\nuntil the SOR was issued. I also considered that Applicant failed to notify her creditors that she was\nmoving. Applicant has provided minimum documentation to support she is repaying her debts. I find\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised by the financial considerations\nand personal conduct concerns. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case,\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a favorable trustworthiness\ndetermination. Accordingly, Guideline F and Guideline E are decided against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Applicant requested the case be decided on the written\nrecord.  On September 15, 2006, after considering the record, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nApplicant deliberately made a false statement on her Security Clearance Application; whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious or contrary\nto law.\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge erred by concluding that Applicant had deliberately made\na false statement on her Security Clearance Applications.  Applicant contends that she omitted the\ninformation about her unpaid debts because she knew the investigator would obtain a copy of her\ncredit report.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred. \nApplicant\u2019s statements about her intent and state of mind when he executed the document\nin question were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider\nApplicant\u2019s statements in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant\u2019s denial of any\nintent to provide false information did not preclude the Judge from weighing the record evidence and\nmaking findings that contradicted Applicant\u2019s denials.  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate is sustainable, and the Judge\u2019s ultimate\nunfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guidelines E and J is not arbitrary, capricious or\ncontrary to law.\n(2) The Board construes the balance of Applicant\u2019s brief as arguing that the Judge\u2019s adverse\ntrustworthiness determination under Guideline F is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.  In\nsupport of this argument, Applicant states that although she has not made any attempts to rectify her\nsituation at this time, she plans to make payments on her outstanding debts in the future.  Applicant\u2019s\nargument does not demonstrate that the Judge erred.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not\nturn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their\napplication requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating\nevidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As\nthe trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s trustworthiness concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\n\n3\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable trustworthiness determination under Guideline F is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe determination of the Judge denying Applicant access to automated information systems\nin ADP I/II/II sensitivity positions is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E.

In November 2002, Applicant\nengaged in four counts of misdemeanor check deception. His subsequent denials (1) that he was\nterminated for misuse of his employer\u2019s credit card in October 2001, (2) that he deliberately omitted\ninformation in June 2004 from his security form and from his May 2005 interview concerning the\nreasons for his termination, (3) that he deliberately concealed the check deception charges from his\nsecurity form in June 2004, and (4) that he still contends he did not conceal anything, establish\nadverse findings under the personal conduct and criminal conduct guidelines that have not been\nmitigated. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On August 31, 2006, under Executive Order 10865 and Department\nof Defense Directive 5200.6, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the reasons for\nits security concerns raised under the personal conduct guideline (Guideline E), and the criminal\nconduct guideline (Guideline J) of the Directive. Applicant furnished three answers to the SOR. One\nanswer is dated October 1, 2006, one is undated, and one is time-stamped by DOHA on November\n3, 2006. Applicant requested a decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on January 9, 2007. Applicant received the FORM on\nJanuary 17, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due by February 16, 2007. No response\nwas submitted. The case was assigned to me for decision on March 22, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nPursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive, I am amending SOR 2.a. by changing the number of\ncounts inside the parentheses from 3 counts to 4 counts. The second sentence in SOR 2.a. is deleted\nand replaced with, \u201cThe four offenses were dismissed upon Applicant\u2019s payment of restitution.\u201d \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR contains five allegations of personal conduct (Guideline E) set forth in paragraph\n1. Applicant denied all allegations under paragraph 1. Paragraph 2 contains two allegations of\ncriminal conduct (Guideline J) which he admitted. Applicant is 45 years old and has been employed\nas a lead technician with a defense contractor since August 2003. He was in the United States Air\nForce Reserve from 1983 to 1986, and has held a security clearance since 1988. Applicant is married.\nAccording to documentation provided by Applicant\u2019s former employer in October 2001,\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor terminated Applicant for two primary reasons. The supervisor\u2019s termination\nletter (Item 9, SOR 1.a.), was based on \u201ca number of areas of deep concern.\u201d Those areas were (1)\nmisuse of a credit card for the second time, (2) unacceptable customer rating based on the client\n\n3\nspecifically requesting Applicant not be allowed on-site, and (3) being absent for two days without\nnotice. The termination letter was sent certified mail to Applicant on October 11, 2001, and was\nsigned by Applicant on October 13, 2001 (Item 10). Item 11 (September 20, 2001) describes the\nrules for proper use of the employer credit card, and an example of how one should be filled out.\nItem 12, dated April 2, 2001 describes the situations in which the credit card was to be used. In bold\nprint, the statement indicates the card is to be used for business only, and improper use could lead\nto disciplinary action \u201cup to and including termination.\u201d According to the statement, the company\nmust be reimbursed if the charge is not for business. The final portion of the exhibit reflects a few\nnon-business entries reimbursed by Applicant, and situations where no receipt was provided.\nApplicant provided reimbursement to the company in two checks amounting to $118.00. \nApplicant\u2019s denial of SOR 1.a. is based on his claim the supervisor told him individually that\nhis termination was for unsatisfactory job performance. Even though the supervisor may have\ndiscussed one of the reasons for his termination, that discussion does not change the fact that\nApplicant received the termination letter detailing management\u2019s reasons for his termination. Item\n9 indicates Applicant was supposed to meet with this supervisor on October 11, 2001 to discuss his\njob performance and future with the company. Applicant failed to appear, and the reasons for\ntermination were sent (certified mail) to his residence. Applicant signed for the termination letter\n(Item 10).\nOn June 25, 2004, less than three years after his termination, Applicant certified a Security\nClearance Application, Standard Form 86 (SCA). In response to question 20 (Your Employment\nRecord), Applicant indicated \u201cyes,\u201d and chose the explanation that he \u201cleft a job by mutual\nagreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance.\u201d From Applicant\u2019s point of view,\nthe circumstances surrounding his termination were not based on mutual agreement as Applicant\nstated in the remarks module of question 20 of the SCA. Rather, Applicant indicated his\ndisagreement with his supervisor\u2019s explanation for the termination (the customer was unhappy with\nApplicant\u2019s job performance). He claimed he had been receiving outstanding performance ratings\nin the past year before his termination. The termination letter (Item 9) does not support Applicant\u2019s\nposition that the termination was mutually agreed to based on allegations on unsatisfactory\nperformance. Considering the evidence as whole, I find Applicant did not leave by mutual\nagreement. I also find he provided misinformation about his job termination. \nIn response to question 26 (in the last 7 years, have you ever been arrested for, charged with,\nor convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?) of the same SCA (and\nalleged in SOR 1.c.), he answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant failed to reveal his four misdemeanor charges for\ncheck deception in November 2002 (less than two years before he certified the SCA). Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation for the \u201cno\u201d answer is that he was arrested for some traffic offense and was never\nprovided notice of the check deception charges that resulted in his restitution. Yet, in response to\nSOR 2.a., Applicant admitted he was cited for the check charges but assumed the corresponding\ncreditors had been paid or the debts owed had been discharged in bankruptcy. \nA summary of filings and other proceedings related to the check deception charges (SOR 1.c.,\n2.a.) is set forth in Item 13, showing Applicant received notice of the charges over the course of\napproximately five months between September 2002 and January 2003, when the charges were\ndismissed. I find against Applicant under SOR 1.c. and 2.a.\n\n4\nOn the same SCA furnished by Applicant in June 2004, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 36 (In\nthe last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other\ndebts?) Though Applicant admitted in his answer that he knew about taxes he needed to pay in 2000,\nthere is insufficient information for me to make a finding under SOR 1.d. against Applicant. \nApplicant denied he provided false information to the investigator (SOR 1.e.) on May 25,\n2005. Applicant\u2019s reliance on the previous conversation with the supervisor regarding Applicant\u2019s\npoor performance does not change the contents of termination letter describing the primary reasons\nfor Applicant\u2019s termination. He knew about both reasons, but only divulged one to the investigator.\nI find Applicant concealed information by not disclosing both reasons for his job termination in\nOctober 2001. \nSubparagraph 2.a. reflects that Applicant was found guilty of four counts (not three) of check\ndeception. The records reflect all charges were dismissed on condition Applicant pay restitution\n(Item 13) which he paid. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting ISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[Security clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E)\nThis guideline applies to poor judgment or dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations.\n\n5\nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J)\nViolating the law shows poor judgment and unreliability.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn applying for security clearance access, an applicant has a responsibility to provide truthful\ninformation during all phases of a security investigation. Two important stages in the investigation\noccur in the completion of the SCA and the interview with an investigator. Applicant\u2019s denial of\nSOR 1.a. and 1.e. is discredited by the documentation to the contrary reflecting the two primary\nreasons he was terminated. His deliberate omissions (SOR 1.a., 1.b. 1.c., and 1.e.) meet the definition\nof personal conduct (PC) disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (the deliberate omission of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire used to determine security\nclearance eligibility) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.3. (deliberately providing false misleading information\nconcerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a personnel security\nor trustworthiness determination). First, under SOR 1.b (question 20 of the SCA), Applicant did not\nleave the job by mutual agreement. Rather he conceded he was being terminated even though he\nthought he had been receiving outstanding performance appraisals in the year before his termination.\nConcerning SOR 1.c., the printout (Item 13) and Applicant\u2019s statement in response to SOR 2.a.\ncompletely impeaches his present assertions to the contrary. \nUnder SOR 1.d. (question 36, liens within the last 7 years), Applicant knew he had taxes to\npay when he filed his bankruptcy. However, there is insufficient evidence for me to conclude from\nhis knowledge of taxes he owed  that he had liens filed against him, particularly when there is no\ndocumentation to show the state filed a lien based on taxes owed. SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e. are\nfound against Applicant. SOR 1.d. is found for him. \nThe mitigating conditions (MC) under the PC guideline have been analyzed, but none apply\nas Applicant does not believe he was terminated for misusing a credit card. PC MC E2.A5.1.3.1. (the\ninformation was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to judgment and trustworthiness) is inapplicable.\nInformation about previous jobs or criminal history is material in the government\u2019s predictive\ndetermination about security clearance access. \nPC MC E2.A5.1.3.2. (the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the\nindividual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily) and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3. (The\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct th falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts) are also unavailable as Applicant still contends he did not conceal any information. Based\non the totality of the evidence, except for SOR 1.d., Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications have not\nbeen mitigated.\nThe adverse evidence of personal conduct also has independent significance under the\ncriminal conduct (CC) guideline. CC DC E2.A10.1.2.1. (allegations or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) applies to SOR 2.a. and 2.b. First,\nApplicant admitted four counts of check deception in November 2002. The fact that the prosecutor\nwithdrew the charges does not eliminate Applicant\u2019s fraudulent conduct. After Applicant\u2019s criminal\nbehavior in November 2002, he violated 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) \u00a7 1001 in June 2004, when\n\n6\nhe deliberately concealed information about (1) why he was terminated from his job in October 2001\nand (2) his criminal record. Information regarding previous jobs and a criminal record is material\nbecause these items of information can change the course of the government\u2019s security investigation\nin making a predictive decision about an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\nThe CC guideline has three mitigating conditions that may apply here. However, Applicant\u2019s\ncurrent view he did  deliberately falsify the security form or the information in his interview\nforecloses the application of any of the following conditions. Those conditions are CC MC\nE2.A10.1.3.1. (the criminal behavior was not recent), CC MC E2.A101.3.2. (the crime was an\nIsolated incident), and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).\nApplicant has not been forthright with the government about his past. SOR 2.a., 2.b., and the CC\nguideline are found against Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s dishonest conduct under the PC and CC guidelines justify the same conclusion\neven when the circumstances of this case are evaluated under the broader factors of the whole person\nconcept. Providing untruthful information about one\u2019s background during a security investigation\nis serious. Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications in June 2004 and May 2005 are aggravated by his\nongoing position that he did nothing wrong. Though the conversation between Applicant and the\nsupervisor could have taken place before his termination in October 2001, Applicant\u2019s employer at\nthe time mailed the company\u2019s official position to Applicant by certified mail which Applicant\nsigned for. His decision not to disclose either that information or his criminal history information\nreinforces the ultimate finding against Applicant under the PC and CC guidelines. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant. \nSubparagraph c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph d.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph e.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph b.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Nagel, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nVirginia Gomez, Attorney at Law\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s 2005 alcohol-related arrest was the result of an isolated incident of poor\njudgment that is unlikely to recur.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 30, 2007. The case was assigned to the\nundersigned on May 1, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 29, 2007, and the hearing was\nheld on June 12, 2007. The transcript was received on June 21, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 26 years of age. He has been a full-time employee of a defense contractor since\nJune 2004.\nApplicant began drinking alcohol in Junior or Senior High School. He continued to consume\nit through college and after he obtained his current employment. Other then the incident discussed\nbelow, there is no credible evidence that he abuses alcohol.\nIn November 2005, applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol or Drugs and (2) Driving While Having a 0.08% or Higher Blood Alcohol Level. In\nAugust 2006, he pleaded no contest to the second charge and the first charge was dismissed. He was\nplaced on probation for three years, ordered to pay approximately $1,697.00 in costs and fines, and\nordered to complete a first offense alcohol program. Applicant paid the $1,697.00, and completed\nthe alcohol program (Exhibit A). He is still on probation.\nApplicant testified that on the night he was arrested he didn\u2019t appreciate the extent of his\nintoxication. He further testified that since he now realizes he can\u2019t accurately estimate if he has\nconsumed too much alcohol to drive, he will no longer drive after consuming any alcohol. He further\ntestified that he is committed to this course of action irrespective of his probationary status (TR at\n21, 26-27, 36-37).  Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible and worthy of belief.\nDeclarations from three of applicant\u2019s coworkers, including his immediate supervisor, were\nadmitted into evidence. All three individuals state that applicant is reliable and trustworthy, and has\nshown no signs of having an alcohol problem.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrest and conviction reflect adversely on his judgment, and raise\n\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct. 15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable\n1\njudgment . . . can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct. 30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about a\n2\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nPages 18 and 19.\n3\n3\nconcerns under both Guideline E  and Guideline J.  Disqualifying Conditions 31(a) (a single serious\n1\n2\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses) and 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) are\napplicable. \n Applicant clearly learned a valuable lesson from this incident; namely, he cannot accurately\nassess his level of impairment after consuming alcohol. As a result, he made the decision not to drive\nafter consuming any alcohol. This decision, the lack of any evidence indicating he may be unable\nto follow through with it (e.g., diagnosis of alcohol dependence), and the very favorable character\nreferences admitted into evidence, lead me to conclude that this was an isolated incident of criminal\nconduct that is unlikely to recur. Mitigating Conditions 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and\n32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement) are applicable.\nBased on the foregoing, and after consideration of the general factors set forth in Enclosure\n2, Paragraph 2 of the Directive,  Guidelines E and J are found for applicant.\n3\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: FOR THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: FOR  THE APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts and that he had not\ncorroborated his claim to have begun paying them off earlier than 2007.  The Judge also found that\nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 37 of a Security Clearance Application completed in March\n2005, which asked if he had had any judgements against him in the previous seven years.  The Judge\nfound that this answer was untrue, insofar as a creditor had obtained a judgement against Applicant\nin May 2003, and Applicant was aware of this at the time he completed the application.\nA Judge\u2019s  findings must be based upon substantial record evidence.  Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.32.1;\nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  We have examined the\nJudge\u2019s findings in light of the record and conclude that even if there are errors, they are harmless\nin that they are minor and would not reasonably have affected the outcome of the case.  See ISCR\nCase No. 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006).  Furthermore, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision\nthat Applicant failed to mitigate the Guideline F security concerns is sustainable on this record.  See\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15 (\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant and proven by Department\nCounsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d)\nOn appeal, Applicant claims the Judge did not consider evidence contained in his written\nsubmissions.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the record evidence.\nSee ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005).  Applicant fails to rebut that\npresumption.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Disqualifying\nCondition (DC) 7(d).   Department Counsel also argues that the Judge erred in her analysis of the\n2\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns by focusing only on Applicant\u2019s relationship with her in-laws,\ninstead of broadening that analysis to include the relationship between Applicant and her husband,\nwhose clearance she denied.  It is Department Counsel\u2019s contention that this error is harmful because\nthe security concerns presented by the independent, disqualifying relationship between Applicant and\nher husband could not be mitigated under the rationale given by the Judge in her decision.3\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.\nIn her decision, the Judge only applied DC 7(a), and analyzed Applicant\u2019s situation only in\nthe limited context of the security concerns presented by her relationship with her in-laws.  The\nJudge did not discuss the application of DC 7(d), even though such a discussion was warranted by\nthe record, and did not reasonably address the security concerns presented by the relationship\nbetween Applicant and her husband, whose clearance the Judge denied.    Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s\n4\nfavorable clearance decision is not sustainable.  The Judge should issue a new decision which\n\n4\ndiscusses the application of DC 7(d) in light of the Judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions with\nregard to Applicant\u2019s husband.\nOrder\n \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned:Michael Y.
