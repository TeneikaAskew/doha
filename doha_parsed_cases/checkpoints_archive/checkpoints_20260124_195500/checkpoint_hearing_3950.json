Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on August 5, 2022, and August 22, \n2022, and she requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on April 28, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a notice on May 2, 2023, scheduling the matter for a video teleconference (VTC) \nhearing on June 6, 2023. DOHA issued an amended notice on May 26, 2023, \nrescheduling the matter for a VTC hearing on June 5, 2023, due to a scheduling conflict. \nApplicant waived the 15-day notice requirement required by the Directive.  \n1\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI convened the hearing as rescheduled.

She timely \nsubmitted documentation that I admitted in evidence collectively as AE A without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. She is 40 years old, married, and she \nhas one adult child and one minor child. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2015. She has lived with her family in a rental property in state A since \n2019. (Tr. at 8, 22, 47-49; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. military from 2002 to 2008. Due to her \nattending school and caring for her children, she was subsequently unemployed until \nDecember 2014. She then worked as a U.S. Government civilian employee overseas, \nwhere her spouse was stationed as an active-duty military member, until April 2019. Due \nto her recovery following a major surgery and her family\u2019s relocation to the United States, \nshe was again unemployed until December 2019. Since then, she has remained \nemployed by various DOD contractors. She has worked for her current employer as an \ninformation technology project manager since December 2022. She was first granted a \nsecurity clearance when she served in the U.S. military. (Tr. at 5, 9-10, 22-30, 49-51; GE \n1, 5) \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant had three credit-card accounts in \ncollection status (SOR \u00b6\u00b6  1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), in the amounts of $25,295, $5,458, and \n$4,463, respectively. All three debts were reported on her 2021 and 2022 credit bureau \nreports. Only two debts were reported on her 2023 credit bureau report, which reflected \nthe following notations for each debt: (1) \u201cConsumer Disputes \u2013 Reinvestigation in \nProgress\u201d for SOR \u00b6 1.a; and (2) \u201cConsumer Disputes \u2013 Reinvestigation in Progress, \nCharged Off Account, Account Closed by Credit Grantor\u201d for SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Answer; GE 1-\n5)  \nIn her SCA, Applicant reported that all three credit-card accounts were charged off \ndue to nonpayment. She stated that she stopped making monthly payments on the \naccounts after she reported all three credit cards as \u201clost or stolen\u201d in May 2017. She also \nstated that the three debts resulted from unauthorized charges made on the cards, of \nwhich she had not been aware, after she reported them lost or stolen. During her \nNovember 2021 background interview, she told the investigator that the three debts \nresulted from the unknown and unauthorized charges made on the cards after she \nreported them lost or stolen, and the high interest rates that continued to accrue on the \noutstanding balances. She maintained that she did not learn about her delinquent credit \ncards until approximately May 2021. In her Answer, Applicant asserted that the three \ndebts resulted from her being a victim of identity theft.

She\nmaintained that she lost her wallet, which contained the three credit cards and her military\nidentification card, during a vacation cruise she took with her family in the summer of\n2017. She did not report her lost wallet to the cruise ship authorities because she did not\nlose it aboard the ship. She did not think to file a police report with the local authorities.\nShe did not immediately contact her creditors because she did not have any phone or\ninternet service aboard the ship. When she returned from vacation less than one week\nlater, she reported her lost wallet and military identification card to the authorities on the\nU.S. military base where she resided. She also contacted her creditors to report her lost\nwallet and close the accounts. She did not provide documentation to corroborate her\ntestimony. (Tr. at  30-43, 45-46, 49-69) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that all three credit card accounts had balances due to \ncharges she made before she lost her wallet. She claimed that she continued making \npayments toward the balances she incurred on all three accounts after they were closed, \nand until they were each paid in full. She stopped monitoring the three accounts once she \nbelieved that each was paid in full. She denied any knowledge of the unauthorized \ncharges made on each of the credit cards after she reported them lost, in the amounts of \n$10,000, $3,500, and $4,500, for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, respectively. She believed \nthat the charges may have gone through because the accounts were not closed when \nshe believed them to have been closed. The credit bureau reports corroborated that she \nmade payments through April 2018 and August 2019 for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b, respectively. (Tr. at  30-43, 45-46, 49-69) \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed her lack of knowledge about the delinquent \naccounts to having not received any correspondence about them from any of the \ncreditors, due, in large part, to her family\u2019s relocation from their residence overseas to the \nUnited States. Although she had been monitoring her credit using Credit Karma for an \nunspecified period, the three credit card accounts were not reported as delinquent until \nabout 2021 to 2022. She claimed that she had been working with the creditors and major \ncredit reporting agencies to settle or otherwise resolve these debts and have them \nremoved from her credit report. She also placed a security freeze on her credit reports. \n(Answer; Tr. at 30-43, 45-46, 49-69; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant also claimed that, in the summer of 2022, she began working with and \npaying $120 monthly to a credit counseling company, who was assisting her with \ndisputing the three debts and cleaning up her credit report. She maintained that, although \nshe had the financial means to settle and resolve these debts, she had not yet discussed \nthis option with the credit counseling company as of the date of the hearing. She \npreviously believed, based on her own research, as well as information told to her by the \ncredit counseling company, that she was not responsible for paying the three debts since \nthey had been charged off and would eventually fall off her credit report. However, she \nhas since learned that she was mistaken in that belief and has accepted full responsibility \nfor repaying all three debts. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant provided undated documentation reflecting that she enrolled all three \ndebts into a debt relief program with another company. She agreed to pay $514 monthly, \nfrom which the company would make payments to settle these debts on her behalf by \nJune 2027, with the projected next settlement to occur between December 2023 and \nFebruary 2024. She did not provide any documentary evidence that she had commenced \nher payments, or that any of three debts had yet been settled or otherwise resolved \nthrough the program. (Answer; Tr. at 30-43, 45-46, 49-69; GE 1-5; AE A) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant earned $135,000 annually. She also \nreceived $2,400 monthly for her 90% disability rating from the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs. She had approximately $4,000 in her bank accounts and $20,000 in her \nretirement savings account. Her spouse expected to retire from the U.S. military in \nSeptember 2023, after 23 years of service, and he intended to obtain employment in the \nprivate sector. She estimated that he earned $100,000 annually. They maintain separate \nfinances, but they share responsibility for paying the household expenses. She stated \nthat the credit counseling company provided her with credit counseling. The credit reports \ndo not list any other delinquent debts. An individual who has known Applicant personally \nand professionally for over 15 years, and for whom Applicant worked as a subcontractor \nafter her discharge from the U.S. military, attested to Applicant\u2019s character, integrity, and \nresponsibility. (Tr. at 23-29, 44-49; GE 1, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant proffered a reasonable basis to dispute the unauthorized charges on her \ncredit card accounts after she reported the credit cards lost, and the credit bureau reports \ncorroborate her efforts to resolve the dispute. However, there remains substantial \nunresolved debt for which she accepted responsibility. She provided conflicting \ninformation about the reason for her delinquent credit cards. As such, it is not clear that \ncircumstances beyond her control contributed to her financial problems. Even if I were to \ngive her the benefit of the doubt, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that she provide evidence that she \nacted responsibly under her circumstances. She failed to do so. \nApplicant did not provide any documentation showing: (1) any payments she made \ntoward the outstanding balances she incurred on the credit cards before they were lost; \nor (2) any efforts she made either to resolve or to dispute the debts with the creditors and \ncredit bureau agencies once she learned that they were outstanding sometime in 2021 \nor 2022. She also did not corroborate any claims of payments she made to the first credit \ncounseling company she engaged in the summer of 2022, or to the second company she \nengaged at a date not in the record. She has not yet made any payments toward her \ndebts, despite having the financial means to do so. \nApplicant has not established that she has her finances under control. Given the \nrecord before me, I find that her delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

(Item 2.) In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted the four SOR allegations under Guideline E and provided a \npersonal statement. On January 10, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the \nDepartment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nconsisting of Items 1 to 8, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on February \n6, 2023. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit any additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on March 29, 2023. Based upon a review of \nthe pleadings, the Government\u2019s exhibits, as well as Department Counsel\u2019s arguments \nset forth in the FORM, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old and married. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2011 and \na master\u2019s degree in 2018. Applicant has worked for a DoD contractor as an analyst since \nJanuary 2013 and was granted national security eligibility at that time.

(Item 4 at \nSections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR sets forth four allegations under the Personal Conduct guideline. The \nGovernment alleges that Applicant has engaged in questionable conduct starting in 2008, \nand most recently in 2021, that involved an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations raising concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. The four allegations and supporting record evidence \nare summarized below: \n1.a. February 2008 Arrest. Applicant was arrested in 2008 and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence (DUI) as a Minor. (Item 3 at 37.) \n1.b. July 2013 Arrest. Applicant was arrested again in 2013 and charged with DUI \nwith a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.15% or more. This arrest occurred within six months of \nApplicant starting his job with a DOD contractor and being granted a security clearance. \nIn July 2014 he plead guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which \nwas suspended. He was also placed on probation for 18 months and fined, and he was \nordered to complete 40 hours of community service, 12 hours of a DUI education course, \nand a meeting of a local Victim Impact Panel. He was further ordered to abstain from \ndrinking alcohol during the term of his probation, to submit to random testing for alcohol, \nand to have an ignition-interlock device installed on his vehicle.

On November 20, 2014, Applicant was ordered to complete Supportive \nOutpatient Substance Abuse treatment and all recommended aftercare. He had \npreviously tested positive for alcohol. This condition was added by the court on the \nrecommendation of the probation office supervising Applicant\u2019s probation. On January 8, \n2016, Applicant\u2019s period of probation was extended six months to July 10, 2016, to \nprovide Applicant with additional time to complete the terms and conditions of his \nprobation. On April 15, 2016, Applicant probation terms were amended to add a \nrequirement that he complete \u201ca cognitive program\u201d within 90 days. (Item 4 at 6-8.) \n1.c. July 2016 Arrest Warrant. Applicant failed to abide by the terms of his \nprobation and the state moved the court to revoke his probation and impose the \nsuspended sentence of 120 days. The prosecutor\u2019s motion recites that Applicant only \nperformed half of his 40 hours of community service, failed to participate in an outpatient \nsubstance abuse treatment program, and tested positive for alcohol on at least two \noccasions, once in 2014 and again in 2015. The court issued a warrant for Applicant\u2019s \narrest. (Item 5 at 1-2; Item 7 at 2.) \n1.d. January 2021 Revocation of Probation. In July 2020 Applicant learned about \nthe arrest warrant. He turned himself into the county sheriff and was arrested. He \nappeared in court on October 2, 2020, and he was released on a $1,000 bond. His \nprobation was continued. He was given a new court date of January 21, 2021. At the \nJanuary hearing, the court revoked Applicant\u2019s original probationary sentence and \nimposed a sentence of confinement for 11 days in the county jail, commencing on \nFebruary 4, 2021, and a fine. (Item 6; Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant failed to timely report his 2013 DUI arrest to the security officer at his \nemployer. He also failed to report his arrest in July 2020 for violating his probation and \nhis October 2020 court appearance. He ultimately reported his criminal history to his \nemployer on November 16, 2020. He updated his history in a second report in February \n2021. (Item 7 at 1-2.) \nApplicant noted in his Answer that he has learned from his past mistakes. He wrote \nthat he had married, and the couple had purchased their first home as evidence of his \nmaturity. He also commented that he loves his work and highly respects the service \nmembers he supports at his employment. (Item 2 at 1.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established by Applicant\u2019s two arrests for DUI and his repeated failure \nto comply with the terms and conditions of his probation, which resulted in the issuance \nof an arrest warrant in July 2016, his arrest on the warrant in July 2020, and his jail \nsentence in January 2021. \nAG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that can mitigate security concerns raised by \nan applicant\u2019s personal conduct. The following condition potentially applies to the facts of \nthis case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe facts in this case do not support application of the above mitigating condition. \nThe underlying DUI offense is not minor and Applicant\u2019s repeated refusal to comply with \nthe terms of his probation over a period of years raises concerns that his failure to abide \nby rules and regulations, in this case, specific court orders and probation terms and \nconditions, is serious. Additional personal misconduct is likely to recur.

The administrative judge should \nconsider the following nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the \nwhole-person factors listed above in light of all pertinent facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of his probation is \nserious misconduct, which continued over a number of years. He has provided no \nsignificant evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral changes. In fact, Applicant \nfailed to timely self report to his employer his 2013 DUI arrest, his conviction and probation \nin July 2014, and his July 2020 arrest on a warrant for failure to comply with his probation. \nHis failure to self-report these incidents is evidence of a lack of rehabilitation. He remains \npotentially vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. The likelihood of \nrecurrence of his past immature and irresponsible behavior is significant. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 - Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in Paragraph 4 of the SOR, with explanation. Applicant is 49 years old, twice divorced, and has three children, two of whom are adults. He has worked for a defense contractor since June of 2018. (GX 1 at pages 7, 12, 18~20 and 22~23.). Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuae 1.a.

He denied the factual allegations \nin Paragraph 4 of the SOR, with explanation. \nApplicant is 49 years old, twice divorced, and has three children, two of whom \nare adults. He has worked for a defense contractor since June of 2018. (GX 1 at pages \n7, 12, 18~20 and 22~23.). \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuae \n1.a. Applicant admits that he used marijuana, about once or twice a month from \nabout 1996 until his last usage in about July of 2015. In 2015, about eight years ago, \nApplicant found out that he had a \u201cheart disease;\u201d and as a result, stopped using \nmarijuana. (TR at page 16 line 4 to page 17 line 22.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n2.b. Applicant has paid his 2015 Federal income tax debt through an \u201cOnline \nAccount\u201d by two payments: $1,000 in April of 2022, and $4,074 in August of 2023. This \nis evidenced by a document from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (PHX A.) On \nAugust 1, 2023, Applicant also filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 \nand 2017, as evidenced by those filings. (PHXs C and D.) He has also submitted \ndocumentation from the IRS showing that Applicant owes \u201c$0.00\u201d for tax years \n2017~2022. (PHX B.) \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \n3.a. Applicant admits that in August of 2015, about eight years ago, he was found \nto be in Contempt of Court during a child custody battle with his second wife. When \nasked if he was using drugs, which his former spouse alleged, Applicant averred \u201cno,\u201d \nsince Applicant had previously ceased any marijuana usage due to his heart condition. \nHowever, he tested \u201cpositive\u201d as a result of his past marijuana usage. (TR at page 18 \nline 18 to page 20 line 6.) As a result, Applicant was sentenced to seven days of \nconfinement for Contempt. \n3.b. Applicant admits that in July of 2018, about five years ago, he was arrested \nand charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). He claims he had consumed a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \ncouple of beers.

Applicant admits that in December of 2019, about four years ago, he was \narrested and charged with being an \u201cunlicensed driver\u201d in State B, which had \nsuspended his State B driver\u2019s license as a result of his 2018 DUI arrest. (AppX A.) \nAlthough he had moved to State B, he was still using his previous valid State A driver\u2019s \nlicense. (TR at page 21 line 14 to page 24 line 21.) \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n4.a. As a result of his July 2018 DUI, noted above in subparagraph 3.b., \nApplicant no longer drives after drinking alcohol. (TR at page 30 line 22 to page 31 line \n14.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used marijuana, about once or twice a month from about 1996 until his \nlast usage in about July of 2015. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana usage was over eight years ago, and because of his \nheart disease he no longer uses marijuana. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and \n2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has filed his delinquent Federal income tax returns, and is current with \nthe IRS. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has two convictions offorontempt of Court in 2015, and DUI in 2018. He \nwas also arrested for being an Unlicensed Driver in 2019. This evidence raises security \nconcerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains two conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has passed, nearly four years, since Applicant\u2019s 2019 motor \nvehicle code violation: and more than five years since his July 2018 conviction. Criminal \nConduct is found for Applicant. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. One condition may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nApplicant committed and was convicted of a DUI in 2018. This evidence raises \nthe above security concern, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, \nor mitigate that concern. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.  \nApplicant no longer drives after drinking alcohol. His DUI occurred more than five \nyears ago, and he has complied with all the court-ordered DUI programs. Alcohol \nConsumption is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. Applicant is clearly respected in the \nworkplace and in his community. (PHXs E~J.) \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse, Financial Considerations, Criminal Conduct, and Alcohol \nConsumption. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a~3c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He has worked as an \naerospace technician for a government contractor for the last two years. His SCA shows \nthat he has been consistently employed since 2008. This is his first application for a \nsecurity clearance. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $31,240. The status of the debts \nis as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan placed in collection for $22,321. The credit report shows \nthat it is now charged-off, and that he opened this loan in 2013. Applicant admitted the \ndebt and stated that it was the result of an auto accident in 2016. He reported that he was \nin the process of changing his auto insurance when he had the accident, and he was \nliable for paying the loan balance of the car that he wrecked. He stated that he stopped \nmaking payments on the loan in 2016. He claims that the lender offered him a settlement \nagreement, but he did not have the money at the time to accept it. He admitted that his \ninitial plan was to ignore the debt until it dropped off his credit report, but he came to \nrealize that it was important to resolve to rehabilitate his credit score. He claimed that he \nis saving money so that he can make a payoff offer. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; \nItems 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d are student loans placed in collection totaling $6,305. The credit \nreport shows that the loans were opened in 2014 and 2015, and the date of last activity \nwas November 2015. On his SCA, he reported taking classes at a technical school in \n2014. Applicant admitted the debts and stated that he planned to apply for loan \nforgiveness. If he does not get loan forgiveness, he plans to establish a payment plan. \nThese debts are unresolved. (Answer; Items 4, 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is an account placed in collection for $1,405. The credit report shows \nthat it is a rental agreement that is now charged-off, which was opened in 2019, and the \ndate of last activity was in 2020. Applicant denied this debt and claimed that it was paid. \nHe claimed that he made a lump-sum payment on this debt in 2021 but did not provide \nany documentation supporting his assertion.

Applicant claimed that the credit card was obtained for his fianc\u00e9 to use for \nexpenses related to their child. He claims that she did not tell him that she had used the \ncard and that a payment was due. He denies this debt and claims that it was paid but did \nnot provide any documentation supporting his assertion.

Applicant denies these debts and claims that they were paid, but he did not \nprovide any documentation supporting his assertion. These debts are unresolved. \n(Answer; Items 5, 6)  \nIn his January 2022 background interview with a government investigator, he \nclaimed that his monthly net income is about $7,500, and his monthly expenses are about \n$5,480. He was unsure about what happened to his monthly surplus. He reported that he \ndid not have a monthly budget, but he planned to make one. He stated that he did not \nintend to have delinquent debt. He asserted that he was trying to live within his means, \nand help people before himself. (Item 5)   \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant did not provide any documentation concerning his \ncurrent financial situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, and his assets. He \nprovided no evidence that he has received credit counseling. Since 2018, he has taken \nfour international vacations, once to Mexico and three times to Costa Rica. (Items 4, 5). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, his background interview, and the credit reports \nin the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat any of the SOR debts are resolved or being paid, or that they became delinquent \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He also failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of his current financial situation, evidence which might establish his ability \nto address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his delinquent debt is recent, ongoing, \nand not isolated. His failure to meet his financial obligations continues to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (e) could potentially apply to SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.h. However, Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient documentation of payment arrangements, payments made, or \nefforts made to dispute the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of his delinquent debts \nunder Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. at 17- 18, 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) Applicant developed financial problems as a result of his divorce. The amended SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $23,000. The debts are listed on one or more credit reports from July 2021, March 2022, January 2023, and August 2023. (Tr. at 14, 18; GE 2-5) Applicant accepts responsibility for his financial issues. He borrowed from his father to pay his attorney for his divorce. Applicant paid this loan and two car loans that were not alleged in the SOR, but he has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He testified that he would pay his debts if the creditors would work with him. He has not received financial counseling. He asserted that he loves his job, and his finances would not cause him to do anything to harm this country.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 8-9) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since June 2018. He attended college for a period, but he has not \nearned a degree. He married in 2016 and divorced in 2020. He has one child. (Tr. at 17-\n18, 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \n \nApplicant developed financial problems as a result of his divorce. The amended \nSOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $23,000. The debts are listed on one \nor more credit reports from July 2021, March 2022, January 2023, and August 2023. \n(Tr. at 14, 18; GE 2-5) \nApplicant accepts responsibility for his financial issues. He borrowed from his \nfather to pay his attorney for his divorce. Applicant paid this loan and two car loans that \nwere not alleged in the SOR, but he has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nHe testified that he would pay his debts if the creditors would work with him. He has not \nreceived financial counseling. He asserted that he loves his job, and his finances would \nnot cause him to do anything to harm this country. (Tr. at 15-17, 20-23; GE 2-5) He \nwrote in his post-hearing email: \nI received in the mail today a garnishment notice from my employer for the \n[SOR \u00b6 1.a - $5,454] loan which will start being garnished from my pay \ncheck starting this upcoming payday 8/16/2023. This will help resolve that \nportion of collection on my credit report and put me in a better position \ncredit wise. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce. That qualifies as an \nevent that was beyond his control. To receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also \nprove that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He testified that he \nwould pay his debts if the creditors would work with him. It is difficult to accept that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant could not find a single creditor to take his money. One creditor obtained a \ngarnishment order against him. However, court-ordered or otherwise involuntary means \nof debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight than means initiated \nand carried through by the debtor himself. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Additionally, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay his debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. I find that financial considerations \nsecurity concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive information about a month later. \nHe subsequently submitted an SCA in April 2018, seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Applicant stated in his 2021 SCA, that he was granted eligibility for \naccess to top-secret information during the same month. (Item 2 at 50) \nIn his September 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed he purchased and used \nmarijuana from about July 2021 through August 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He explained that he \nsustained a \u201cdebilitating back injury\u201d and decided to use marijuana to help alleviate his \nsciatic nerve pain. He purchased the marijuana he used in the form of edibles, from a \nlocal dispensary. He stated he ingested it about three to five times during this period. \n(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant stated he also sought medical treatment through a chiropractor, and that \nafter a few weeks of rehabilitation and after purchasing a new mattress, he stopped using \nmarijuana in about August 2021. He has not received drug counseling or treatment, and \nhe stated he does not socialize or associate with any person who uses drugs illegally. \n(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his September 2021 SCA, Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether \nhe used marijuana while possessing a security clearance.

Applicant also acknowledged understating at \nthe time he purchased and used marijuana, that marijuana remains a federally illegal \ncontrolled substance. \nApplicant stated his intention to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal drugs in \nthe future in his September 2021 SCA, and later signed a similar sworn statement in \nFebruary 2023. (Item 2 at 48, and Item 4 at 4) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guidelines note several conditional that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nThe admitted allegations in this case establish the above disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c), and shift the burden to Applicant to provide mitigation of \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns. Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana in July \nand August 2021 is established by his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a; and by his disclosures in \nhis September 2021 SCA and December 2021 interview with a DOD investigator, \nauthenticated in February 2023.  \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a without comment, it is not \nestablished that his 2021 drug use occurred \u201cwhile [he was] granted access to classified \ninformation\u201d as alleged, and as required by AG \u00b6 25(f). In making this determination, I \nconsidered the Appeal Board guidance provided in ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 10, 2022), recently affirmed in ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2023). The Appeal Board determined that AG \u00b6 25(f) requires proof of a signed \nnondisclosure agreement and evidence of need-to-know access to classified or sensitive \ninformation, neither of which are present in the record. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. \nGuideline H lists conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate security concerns raised \nby the potentially disqualifying conditions above. The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, starting in high school \nin 1991 and continued through August 1995 after he was criminally charged with a drug \noffense, is not recent. However, his purchase and use of marijuana from July through \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 2021 is recent, having occurred only weeks before his current SCA completed in \nSeptember 2021. Notably, his use also occurred while employed by a federal defense \ncontractor, following applications both a position of public trust in 2011, and a top-secret \nsecurity clearance in 2018. See ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2023). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Though Applicant acknowledged his 2021 drug \ninvolvement and signed a sworn statement to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal \ndrugs in the future, providing some mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3); he has not mitigated \nconcerns regarding his decision and action to purchase and use marijuana in the first \nplace. Applicant has a prior history of illegal drug involvement starting in 1991. He also \nacknowledged being fully aware that marijuana remains a federally illegal controlled \nsubstance prior to purchasing and using it in 2021. Moreover, though his debilitating back \ninjury was undoubtedly painful, he stated he was able to successfully treat the condition \nafter a few weeks of rehabilitation work with a chiropractor, and purchasing a new \nmattress. Applicant has not established a pattern of abstinence here. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns regarding his drug involvement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to question him about his prior actions or his future intentions of \nmarijuana use, or to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nhis drug involvement.

He was running a family \nbusiness that had about five employees. He attempted to claim a significant amount of \nbusiness deductions on his personal federal tax return for 2012, which the IRS \nultimately disallowed. This resulted in the large tax debt stated in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He also \nclaimed that several personal circumstances contributed to him not being able to file his \nfederal and state tax returns for years 2014 to 2020. Those circumstances included the \nfailure of his business, the death of his father, and his divorce. He admitted that a \ncontributing factor to his non-filing of the returns was his not knowing how to deal with \nthe 2012 tax debt and its implications on the succeeding years\u2019 tax returns. He did not \nthink he could file subsequent federal tax returns if he had not filed an earlier year\u2019s \nreturn. He consulted with a tax professional about this and was told to file all his \ndelinquent returns even if he had not filed an earlier return. Applicant failed to follow this \nadvice because he could not afford a tax professional to prepare and file the unfiled \nreturns.

He \nexplained that he used marijuana because of a degenerative back condition that caused \nhim extreme pain. He began experiencing this condition in approximately 1997 or 1998. \nHe has been receiving medical care for the condition since that time. In 2010, he moved \nto a state where use of medical marijuana is legal under state law. He began using \nmarijuana for his back pain and found that it helped. He stopped using it from 2019 to \n2020 because the marijuana caused him to become sleepy frequently and he did not \nlike that effect on him. In October 2021, after he began working for his current employer \nand completed his SCA, his back pain worsened and he began using marijuana again. \nHe continued to use marijuana in February and June 2022 when he experienced back-\npain flareups. Applicant testified he was unaware of his employer\u2019s drug policy which \nprohibited use of marijuana by employees even if such use was authorized under state \nlaw. He admitted that he did not inform his employer about his use of marijuana. He \nprovided a copy of a drug test result from April 2023 showing a negative result for the \npresence of marijuana in his system.

(AE G). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a delinquent federal tax debt that remains unpaid, although he has \nrecently made one payment toward that debt. He also failed to timely file his 2014-2020 \nfederal and state income tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax debt is still outstanding. Although he made one payment \ntoward the debt in April 2023, the outstanding balance remains between $25,000 and \n$30,000 on a tax debt incurred in 2012. He has apparently entered a payment plan with \nthe IRS, but he did not document the details of the plan. He gave several reasons for \nhis delayed payment toward his his tax debt and the late filing of his federal and state \ntax returns. While his father\u2019s death, the loss of his business, and his divorce are \ncircumstances beyond his control, the IRS disallowance of deductions on his 2012 \npersonal federal tax return was not such a condition. Regardless, the evidence does not \nsupport that he has taken responsible actions to address his tax debt or timely file his \nfederal tax and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. He receives some credit for \nfinally filing his 2014-2020 federal and state tax returns in 2022, however, that credit is \nminimized by his extended delay in filing those returns. Likewise, he receives some \ncredit for entering into an agreement with the IRS to pay his 2012 tax debt, but his delay \nin doing so minimizes its impact. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse. \nFrom about 2010 to June 2022, Applicant used marijuana on numerous \noccasions. I find the above disqualifying condition applies. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana on a regular basis from 2010 to June 2022. Of \nincreased concern, is his admitted multiple uses of marijuana after having completed his \nSCA in April 2021. While he provided a negative drug test result from April 2023 and a \ncopy of his prescription to address his reoccurring back pain, it is too soon to determine \nwhether Applicant will discontinue his use of marijuana to manage his back pain issues. \nHe did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from future use. Given his \npattern of use, his abstinence beginning in 2022 is not sufficient to overcome his \nprolonged marijuana use, or to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. The frequency \nand recency of his past use, and his uses after he completed a first SCA in 2021 cast \ndoubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) or 26(b) apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his medical condition, \nhis civilian employment, and his family circumstances, but I also considered his lack of \nprogress in resolving his federal tax debt and timely filing his 2014-2020 federal and \nstate income tax returns. Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. I also considered his recent uses of marijuana. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations and Guideline H, drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1,c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 31 years old. He is married a second time with no children. He has a high school diploma, and military training. He holds the position of Aviation Mechanic II with a defense contractor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to two separate creditors for delinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,000, which were charged off by the creditors. Also, alleged is while in the military, Applicant was investigated for violations of the UCMJ Article 21, Larceny: Military Property More Than $500, and Article 132, Fraud: Making False Claim. In his answer, Applicant admits allegation 1.a., and denies allegations 1.b., and 1.c. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 19, 2021; April 27, 2022; and September 13, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 5, 6 and 7.)

On July 15, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 25, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2022. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on November 2, \n2022, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on December 12, 2022. \nThe \nGovernment offered seven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich were admitted without objection.

DOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 27, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is married a second time with no children. He has \na high school diploma, and military training. He holds the position of Aviation Mechanic \nII with a defense contractor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to two separate creditors for \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,000, which were charged off by the \ncreditors. Also, alleged is while in the military, Applicant was investigated for violations \nof the UCMJ Article 21, Larceny: Military Property More Than $500, and Article 132, \nFraud: Making False Claim. In his answer, Applicant admits allegation 1.a., and denies \nallegations 1.b., and 1.c. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 19, 2021; April \n27, 2022; and September 13, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 5, \n6 and 7.) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps for nine years from November 2011 to \nNovember 2020. \nDuring his military career, he held a security clearance without \nincident, and was deployed on three separate occasions on overseas tours and multiple \nsmall mission attachments. He received a number of awards and commendations \nincluding Good Conduct Medals, Meritorious Masts Certificates, and several Naval \nAviation Marine Corps Medals. He received an honorable discharge. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits G and H.) \n1.a. \nIn 2013, Applicant was in the military. He married a woman and was receiving \nbasic allowance for housing (BAH), which provides money to cover service members \nhousing and related costs in the civilian market when government quarters are not \navailable. The BAH he received was to support himself and his dependent. In 2015, \nhis wife joined the Air Force and was commissioned as an officer. Applicant continued \nto receive BAH, which he was not entitled to receive. The rule is that a military member \nmarried to another military member who has no dependents other than the spouse is \nentitled to partial BAH, meaning one member receives BAH, not both. Applicant claims \nthat he unknowingly received more BAH than he was entitled to receive. In 2017, \nApplicant and his wife divorced. Applicant stopped the BAH, and Applicant deployed to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOkinawa. An audit was conducted when Applicant was deployed to Okinawa, IPAC. \nApparently for at least two years, Applicant received BAH which he was not entitled to \namounting to at least $20,000 in extra pay. In November 2017, Applicant was \ninvestigated for violations of UCMJ Article 121-Larceny, Military Property More Than \n$500, and Article 132-Fraud, Make False Claim. Applicant stated that he went before a \nmilitary board, comprised of the Commanding Officer and members from the Squadron. \nHe explained that he unknowingly received more BAH than he was allowed. His \ncommanding officer dismissed the charges against him and nothing more came of the \ninvestigation. Applicant did not receive non-judicial punishment or a court martial. In \n2020, Applicant separated from the military with an honorable discharge. He is entitled \nto re-enlist if he so chooses. For some unknown reason, Applicant was not required to \npay the BAH money back to the military. There was no waiver filed, no garnishment \naction implemented, nor was his salary reduced due to this fraud. \nThe following delinquent debts were of security concern: \n1.b. \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor on an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $32,542. \nHe explained that in 2015/2016, he took out a \npersonal loan that he used on his vehicles, and to loan money to a friend. After a while, \nApplicant was unable to continue to afford to make the monthly payments on the \npersonal loan. He was not contacted by the creditor for payment. When his finances \nimproved, he contacted the creditor and obtained a settlement offer that he agreed to. \nApplicant has now successfully settled the account for less than was owed in the \namount of $16,272. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, E, L, O, and P, and Tr. p. 36.) \n1.c. \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor on an account that was charged off in the \namount of $5,432. This was a credit card that Applicant opened. For a while he was \nusing it and paying it off. He got to a point where he could no longer afford to pay his \nbills and the debt went into collections. He was not contacted by the creditor for \npayment. When his finances improved, Applicant contacted the creditor and resolved \nthe debt in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, K, L, and M.) \nApplicant testified that he has also taken a credit counseling class to learn how to \nproperly budget his finances. He states that he is more financially mature and now \nunderstands his mistakes in the past and how to prevent them from happening in the \nfuture. He also knows how to handle his credit and his debts without difficulty. He now \nstrives to follow his monthly budget, and puts money away in savings. (Tr. p. 39.) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent financial statement shows that his current debts are paid off, \nand he is on track and financially sound. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N.) \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s Site Supervisor, who was also in the \nMarine Corps with the Applicant working the same platforms, indicates that Applicant \nhas many favorable characteristics. He has a positive work ethic, attention to detail, \nstrict adherence to rule and regulations, and strives to build a trustworthy relationship \namongst his team and customers. Applicant is described as a great mentor, friend, and \nwork colleague. He is recommended for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt that he could not afford to pay. He also \nreceived military financial benefits that he was not entitled to receive. His actions or \ninactions both demonstrated a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do \nso. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has resolved his delinquent debts.  He understands the importance of \nbeing responsible and trustworthy in every aspect of his life, including his finances.  He \nhas paid off his delinquent debts, and is current with all of his regular monthly expenses. \nIn regards to his alleged violations of the UCMJ Article 121-Larceny, and Article 132-\nFraud, he went before a military board for these offenses, he explained that he \nunknowingly received more BAH than was allowed, and the charges against him were \ndismissed.  Furthermore, following this, he received an honorable discharge from the \nmilitary, and the ability to re-enlist if he so chose.   \nApplicant understands the great responsibilities attached with holding a security \nclearance, and the many sacrifices one must make to hold the privilege. He is now \nfollowing a financial budget and has modified his spending habits to be consistently \nfinancially responsible. \nHe also understands that he must follow all rules and \nregulations applicable to him. \nApplicant has demonstrated responsibility and good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Mitigating conditions 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) \nare applicable. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. \nOverall, Applicant has shown great progress towards \nresolving his debts. He must continue to be financially responsible going forward. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his \nburden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant\u2019s character \nand work ethic are impressive. He must continue to show financial responsibility and \nabide by all rules, regulations, and Federal and state laws in the future, or he will be in \njeopardy of losing his security clearance and access to classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.c  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 46 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s degree in 2005. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2020. He is also self-employed with his own business since August 2017. Except for a period from May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant has worked for federal contractors since 2008. He was married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He does not have children. (Item 3) Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2021.

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on September \n21, 2022. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuations or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 2 through 10. (Item 1 is the SOR.) Applicant \ndid not submit a response to the FORM, file objections or submit any material or \ndocuments. Items 2-10 are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2000 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2005. He has been employed by a federal contractor since November 2020. \nHe is also self-employed with his own business since August 2017. Except for a period \nfrom May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant has worked for federal contractors since 2008. \nHe was married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He does not have children. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2021. In it, he \ndisclosed he has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that in February 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a \nvehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with .10 blood alcohol content (BAC) in \nState A. In July 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ndisclosed that in 2012 he was stopped by police after he had drinks at a bar. He could \nnot recall how many. He was arrested and later went to court and pleaded guilty to the \noffense. He said his driver\u2019s license was suspended for some time, but could not recall \nfor how long. He was required to pay a fine and perform community service. (Items 2, 3, \n10) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that in November 2015 he was arrested for driving \nunder the influence (DUI) of alcohol in State B. He was at a bar with friends and consumed \nbetween four to five alcoholic beverages. He felt fine to drive. He was stopped by police \nand failed a breathalyzer test. He pleaded guilty to DUI. He told the government \ninvestigator that he was ordered to pay a fine, complete community service, and his \nlicense was suspended for three months. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b that alleged he was \ncharged with DUI in November 2015, found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and \n36 months probation. (Items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10) \nIn February 2017, Applicant was charged with driving when privilege suspended \nfor prior DUI conviction in State B. In May 2017, a bench warrant was issued against him \nfor this offense. It remains active as of the close of the record.

The warrant \nremains active as of the close of the record. (Items 8, 9) \nIn December 2017, Applicant was charged in State C with leaving the scene of a \ncrash and driving while license revoked due to DUI. It appears he had a plea agreement \nand pleaded guilty or no contest to the revocation offense and received a 30-day jail \nsentence, which was suspended, and a fine. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the government investigator that in April 2019 he was at a friend\u2019s \nhouse and consumed between four and five alcoholic beverages. He was driving home \nwhen he was in a one-car accident. According to the police report, Applicant was trapped \nin the vehicle and the roof had to be cut off by the fire department to extricate him from it. \nHe was observed by the fireman on scene to be highly intoxicated. A check by the police \nrevealed Applicant\u2019s license had been revoked for a previous DUI. The effective dates of \nthe revocation was from July 2016 to July 2019. Applicant refused consent to submit to a \nblood test. The police obtained a search warrant for Applicant\u2019s blood test results. His \nblood alcohol level at the time of the accident was .204%. The court records reflect \nApplicant was charged with DUI in State C, driving while license revoked, and failure to \nhave insurance. He was convicted of the offenses. He received 2 days\u2019 home confinement \nfor the DUI (one day suspended), 30 days\u2019 home confinement for driving with a revoked \nlicense, and fines for all three offenses. (Items 5, 10) \nApplicant told the government investigator that he does not believe he has a \nproblem with alcohol. For his 2015 and 2019 DUI convictions, he was required to attend \ncourt-ordered alcohol awareness classes. He said he no longer drinks and drives. He is \na social drinker and goes out about once a month or two months. He will consume two to \nthree alcoholic beverages and will not drive. He has no intention of drinking and driving \nin the future. He said he will not drive even if he consumes one drink. (Item 10) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that from January 2017 to March 2017 he used \ncocaine three or four times while at parties. He was not working as a government \ncontractor at the time. He told the government investigator that he stopped using it \nbecause he did not like it and he did not intend to use it or any other illegal drug in the \nfuture. (Items 3, 10) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.j alleged delinquent medical accounts, credit cards, \ncommunication services, utilities, and other consumer accounts totaling approximately \n$35,249. Applicant admitted them all in his SOR answer. He told the government \ninvestigator that he had some financial problems during the COVID pandemic when he \ndid not have enough work and fell behind on his bills. When the investigator confronted \nhim with his delinquent accounts he said he was unaware the accounts were delinquent, \nand he would look into them and resolve them. These collection accounts are reported in \nApplicant\u2019s June 2021 and February 2022 credit bureau reports. Applicant did not provide \nany information about actions he may have taken to pay, dispute, or resolve these \naccounts.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nIn 2012, Applicant was charged and convicted of operating a vehicle while \nintoxicated and operating a vehicle with a BAC of .10 % in State A. In 2015, he was \ncharged and convicted of DUI in State B. In 2019, he was charged and convicted of DUI \nwith a BAC more than .15% and driving while license revoked for DUI in State C. His BAC \nat the time was .204%. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating condition under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents beginning in 2012. He does not \nbelieve he has a problem with alcohol, despite three DUI convictions. He was required to \ntake an alcohol education class after two of his convictions. He did not provide any \nevidence that he is participating in alcohol counseling or treatment, evidence of actions \nhe may have taken to overcome his problem or his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use or \nevidence to overcome it. He stated to the government investigator in 2021 that he does \nnot drink and drive anymore. He provided no other evidence that future alcohol-related \nissues are unlikely to recur. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following three are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nApplicant has three DUI convictions from 2012-2019. In State B, he was charged \nwith driving when privilege suspended for prior DUI conviction and an active bench \nwarrant remains as of the close of the record. He also has a bench warrant from March \n2017 from State B for failing to comply with probation conditions related to his 2015 DUI. \nIn State C he was charged in December 2017 with leaving the scene of a crash and \ndriving while license revoked for DUI. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has three DUI convictions from 2012 to 2019 and he repeatedly drove \nafter his license was revoked or suspended. He did not establish that the two active bench \nwarrants have been resolved. He did not provide mitigating information about his criminal \nconduct. Based on his past history and pattern of criminal conduct, I cannot find that future \ncriminal behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant has not provided evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. His past behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used cocaine three to four times in 2017.

I was unable to \nmake a credibility determination, but note that there are no other indications of illegal drug \nuse in his past and that although he was required to disclose past drug use, it is unlikely \nthat his past use of cocaine would have been discovered had he not disclosed it. It has \nbeen approximately five years since he used cocaine and future use is unlikely to recur. \nI find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to being underemployed during the \npandemic when he was unable to pay some of his bills. He was unaware of many of his \ndebts, but told the investigator he would look into them and resolve them. He admitted all \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any evidence of actions he has taken \nto pay, resolve, or dispute any of the delinquent debts.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. He mitigated the \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana with varying frequency from 2009 until 2014. \nHe illegally purchased marijuana with varying frequency from 2011 until 2014. He \nillegally used MDMA once in September 2019 while he held a security clearance. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for five years while he was in college and younger. He \nthen stopped using and purchasing illegal drugs for five years. His abstinence from \nillegal drugs was interrupted by a one-time error in judgment three and one-half years \nago. Acknowledging that this illegal drug use in 2019 was further exacerbated by his \nholding a security clearance, I believe his recent illegal drug use was infrequent enough \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Given the totality of his past drug use, and its infrequency \nsince 2014, I believe that he has established a sufficient period of abstinence from \nillegal drugs. He has also disassociated from drug using associates and contacts. Given \nhis willingness to self-report derogatory information, I find his claims that he will not use \nillegal drugs again to be reliable. Along with his period of abstinence since his last use, I \nconclude his past, illegal drug use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the 2017 tax year. \nHe owed the IRS delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.   \nApplicant has now filed his late federal tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 tax \nyears. He made a payment arrangement with the IRS and paid his delinquent federal \ntaxes. While I am aware that him \u201cfixing\u201d his federal tax deficiencies does not end the \ninquiry, I note that he remedied these tax deficiencies before the Government issued \nthe SOR, in September 2022. He claimed that he has since timely filed and paid his \nfederal taxes for the 2019, 2020, and 2021 tax years. His actions of staying current with \nhis tax obligations after 2018 show reform and rehabilitation. I believe he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and he made a good-faith effort to resolve his tax \nissues. He made a payment arrangement with the IRS and complied with those \narrangements. He has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 \ntax years, despite being required to do so (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He owed delinquent federal \nincome taxes in the approximate amount of $7,800 for the 2017 tax year (after an offset \nfor a refund from a subsequent tax year) (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Items 1-4) \nApplicant filed his late income tax return for the 2017 tax year in February 2020. \nHe filed his late federal income tax return for the 2018 tax year in May 2022. He timely \nfiled his 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns.

He provided no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his belief that he will not owe delinquent federal \ntaxes, or to rebut the information contained in the 2017 IRS tax account transcript. \n(Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income \ntax returns because he did not think he would have enough money to pay the taxes he \nwould owe. He also claimed that his purchase of a new house and resultant move \ncontributed to him missing the aforementioned income tax filing deadlines. He claimed \nthat he has been filing his income tax returns for 23 years and has not had any tax \nissues other than for these two years. He does not currently have a payment plan in \nplace with the IRS, but plans to make one in the future if he still owes delinquent taxes. \nIn May 2022, he provided a written budget that reflected a monthly surplus of almost \n$5,000. He also claimed that he sold his house and used a portion of the proceeds to \npay off several of his debts. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so more recent \ninformation about his finances is not available.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not timely file federal income tax returns for two years despite being \nrequired to do so. He has owed delinquent federal taxes for about five years. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has filed his delinquent federal income tax returns and also timely filed \ntwo additional years of income tax returns. However, he still owes delinquent federal \ntaxes. He does not have a payment arrangement in place with the IRS to address these \ndelinquent taxes. His financial issues are ongoing and I cannot find they are unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to his delinquent income tax filings, but does not apply to his \ndelinquent taxes, because they are ongoing and not resolved. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns \nbecause he did not believe he could afford to pay his taxes and he sold his home and \nmoved. Neither of these causes were due to circumstances beyond his control. He \ncould have withheld sufficient wages to offset his federal tax obligations, as he claimed \nto have done in the past. Likewise, he was arguably in control of when he moved. \nFurthermore, moving does not reasonably excuse two straight years of not filing income \ntax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant claimed that he sought assistance from a tax professional. However, \nhe still owes delinquent federal taxes with no payment plan in place. Therefore, he has \nnot provided sufficient evidence that his financial issues are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nOther than an offset, Applicant has not made payment on his delinquent federal \ntaxes. He does not have a payment plan in place with the IRS for his outstanding past-\ndue tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant has now filed his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and has \ntimely filed federal income tax returns for two additional years. I find that he has shown \nreform and rehabilitation with respect to filing his federal income tax returns. However, \nhe still owes delinquent federal taxes. He does not have an arrangement in place with \nthe IRS to repay them. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to his failure to timely file his federal income \ntax returns, but does not apply to his delinquent federal taxes. \nWhile two of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nincome tax returns, none applies to his delinquent taxes. Application of a particular \nmitigating condition does not necessarily establish overall mitigation. Overall, the \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He has attended several vocational or online colleges \nbut has not earned a degree or certificate. He has been married since 2014, but he has \nlived separate and apart from his spouse without being legally separated since about \n2020. He has three children, ages 11, 9, and 4. He also had a daughter who passed \naway in a car accident in July 2015. He served with the Virginia National Guard from \n2010 until 2017 and has since served with the Maryland National Guard. (Items 1, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 16 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $36,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p). These delinquencies consist of the \nfollowing: car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); child support (SOR \u00b6 1.c); medical debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.p); student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.k through \n1.m); a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and phone bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o). He admitted the \nSOR allegations except for those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p, which he denied. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. All the SOR allegations are established \nthrough his admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. Most of the SOR debts \nbecame delinquent between November 2017 and June 2020. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through voluntary payments before the \nSOR was issued. He provided documentary corroboration to that effect to the DOD \ninvestigator during his April 2022 security interview. Prior to the SOR being issued, he \nmade a payment arrangement with the creditor of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b to pay $249 per \nmonth. He provided documentary corroboration of this arrangement to the DOD \ninvestigator, but he has not provided documentary corroboration that he has made \nthese payments. The Government\u2019s March 2022 credit report reflects a balance on this \naccount that is only about $20 less than the balance on the 2020 Government credit \nreport, so he does not appear to be complying with those payment arrangements. \n(Items 3-7) \nApplicant claimed that he settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.l before the SOR \nwas issued. However, he has not provided documentary corroboration that he settled \nthese accounts. He claimed that he is paying an additional $50 per month towards his \narrearage on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he has not provided documentary corroboration \nof this assertion. For the remainder of the SOR debts he admitted, he claimed that he \nwill either settle or make payment arrangements on those accounts. He provided no \ninformation about the basis for his denial of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. (Items 2, 7) \nApplicant fell behind on his debts after his daughter passed away in 2015, and \nhis spouse could not work because of her grief. He became the sole earner and could \nnot make ends meet. He was unemployed for about a year from 2013 until 2014. He \nwas also placed on unpaid leave with his current employer from November 2021 until \nJanuary 2022 because his security clearance had \u201cexpired.\u201d According to the \ninformation he provided to the investigator during his April 2022 security interview, he \nspends more money each month than he earns, but stays afloat by borrowing money \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom his parents every month or so.

(Items 3, 7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a number of delinquent debts, many of which are several years \nold. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nExcept for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing \nand therefore recent. He has not provided documentary evidence that he has resolved \nor is resolving the remainder of his SOR debts. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to \npresent documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). The evidence does not show that the debts are \nresolved or are under control. He does not make sufficient money to cover his expenses \neach month, so I cannot find that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by unemployment, a separation, and the \nuntimely death of his daughter in 2015. These causes were beyond his control. \nHowever, he must also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to these debts. He has not. Except for one SOR debt, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he has resolved or is resolving the SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot fully apply. The lack of resolution of his SOR debts also means that AG \u00b6 20(d) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant arguably disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p by denying them in \nhis Answer to the SOR. However, as he provided no basis for his denial, he has not \nshown that the basis for his dispute is reasonable. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nNotwithstanding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. The \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f has been mitigated pursuant to AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in May 2000, and a master\u2019s degree in control \nsystems in May 2003. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in July 2000, in \nconnection his first employer, one of only two employers since he graduated college. He \nhas been employed as an engineer by his sponsor since July 2005. (GE 1; Tr. at 7, 24, \n65) \nIndebtedness History \nApplicant accrued the SOR debts after discharging previous debts through \nbankruptcy. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2009, to get a handle on his \nfinances, which had become strained by an interest rate increase on his underwater \nmortgage. After completing the Chapter 13 repayment plan, his debts were discharged in \n2014.

(Answer; GE 7 at \n2; Tr. at 25-29, 33-34, 46, 70, 73) \nWhile Applicant attributed his indebtedness history primarily to circumstances \nbeyond his control, he accepted responsibly for the role that overspending without a \nsavings buffer played. He believes that his financial problems originated with his \u201cna\u00efve\u201d \ndecision to purchase his first home, in an area with a higher cost of living, and a new car, \nimmediately upon becoming married and gainfully employed in July 2005. He neither \nunderstood the uncertainties of the housing market nor considered other \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d that \nmight occur. He and his wife were lulled into a false sense of security when they were \nboth gainfully employed, which influenced their debt accumulation and spending habits. \nTheir incomes afforded a certain lifestyle to which they became accustomed.

He incurred the $7,446 veterinarian bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b by attempting to \nprolong the life of their family dog after it was diagnosed with cancer. (Answer; GE 7 at 2; \nTr. at 15, 25-27, 28, 33-34, 38-39, 45, 46, 53, 73, 89) \nApplicant purchased his first home in 2005, during the \u201csub-prime housing boom.\u201d \nHe obtained a mortgage loan with a \u201clow down payment.\u201d When the mortgage\u2019s interest \nrate increased in 2009, the balance on the loan exceeded its fair market value by about \n$80,000, due to the housing market \u201ccrash.\u201d To avoid defaulting on his mortgage loan \nand other debts, he consulted a bankruptcy attorney to explore his options and borrowed \n\u201csome money\u201d from his retirement account. In June 2009, he decided to file a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, and not a Chapter 7, because he wanted to honor his debt obligations. His \nChapter 13 repayment plan was confirmed in August 2009. His debts were discharged in \nAugust 2014, after he successfully completed the repayment plan with payments totaling \n$9,000. (GE 1 at 33; GE 6; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4-5; Tr. at 25, 27-29) \nThe bankruptcy allowed Applicant to maintain his mortgage payments until \nNovember 2012, when he relocated from State A to State B. He could not afford to make \nboth the rental payment for his new State B home and the mortgage payment for the \nState A home. Because his mortgage remained underwater by about $75,000, his \nattempts to rent or sell the State A home were unsuccessful. The lender foreclosed on \nhis mortgage loan in about February 2013. The record did not reflect any deficiency \nbalance owed after the lender resold the home. (GE 1 at 33; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4-5; Tr. \nat 25, 27-28) \nDespite the higher cost of living in State B, Applicant and his wife were able to \nmaintain their lifestyle \u201cwithout too much trouble,\u201d since they both had \u201cstable, well-paying \njobs.\u201d However, they began to struggle financially again on a date not specified in the \nrecord, when his wife\u2019s employer underwent new management, who changed the terms \nof her employment. His wife worked in the spa industry. Under her original terms, she \nearned a salary as an independent contractor and paid a rental fee for her workspace. \nUnder her new terms, she earned a commission-based salary, which resulted in a \n\u201csizeable decrease\u201d in her monthly income. After struggling to make ends meet with her \nreduced salary for an unspecified period, he and his wife decided that it was in their \nfamily\u2019s best interest for her to become self-employed. Self-employment allowed her to \nreduce her expenses by not having to pay the rental fee, and to have a flexible schedule \nto care for their children. Although her self-employment income was lower than what she \nearned as an independent contractor, it was higher than her commission-based salary \nand sufficient to meet their needs until October 2015, when complications arose with the \nbirth of their son. (Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s son was born with a medical condition, for which he was hospitalized \nfor \u201cmultiple weeks\u201d following his birth, and again for \u201cmultiple weeks\u201d shortly after his first \nbirthday. Not only did they incur medical expenses that were not fully covered by \ninsurance, but their son\u2019s medical condition precluded him from attending daycare, which \nprecluded his wife from working outside the home. Considering these issues together with \nthe rising cost of living in State B, Applicant and his wife decided to engage the services \nof a debt-relief company (DRC) to consolidate their monthly debt payments before any of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthem became delinquent. At that time, Applicant believed that a \u201cbig company with legal \nbacking\u201d could better represent his interests in negotiating settlements than he could do \non his own. In hindsight, he learned a \u201cvaluable, if not hard lesson\u201d that he may have been \nbetter served by working directly with his creditors. His son\u2019s medical condition eventually \nimproved and he suffered no \u201clong-lasting\u201d health effects. As of the hearing, his son\u2019s \nhealth was \u201cgood.\u201d (Answer; Tr. at 31-32, 37, 70-72) \nDebt Repayment History (through DRC) \nThe DRC required Applicant to stop making all monthly debt payments and allow \nhis debts to fall into delinquent status to facilitate its settlement negotiations with his \ncreditors. He was also required to make bi-weekly payments to the DRC of $657 \nbeginning in June 2018, which increased to $1,314 in September 2018, then $1,382 in \nDecember 2018, and then decreased to $1,089 as of October 2019 (DRC payments). \nThe DRC allocated a portion of the DRC payments to its fees, and then deposited the \nremainder into an account from which it could pay the settlements it negotiated with \nApplicant\u2019s creditors. (Answer; AE B; Tr. at 20, 32-36, 60, 72) \nApplicant struggled to pay the DRC payments at times, particularly after June \n2019, when he relocated from State B back to State A to secure his employment. He and \nhis wife decided that she would not return to the workforce until the fall of 2019, so that \nshe could be home full time with their children over the summer. However, once they \nrealized that her anticipated salary would \u201cjust cover the cost of childcare,\u201d they decided \nthat her return to work \u201cseemed foolish.\u201d His wife\u2019s unemployment during this period \nfurther strained their finances. As a result, in about January 2020, Applicant \u201ccut ties\u201d with \nthe DRC because he could no longer afford to make the DRC payments. (Answer; AE B; \nTr. at 32-36) \nApplicant made 20 DRC payments totaling $17,887 from June 2018 through \nDecember 2019. He recalled that the DRC applied the DRC payments to fully resolve \nthree unalleged debts and make payments toward resolving other debts for which the \nDRC had negotiated settlements. The other debts he managed through the DRC \nincluded: (1) \u201cprobably a handful\u201d of the SOR debts, including SOR \u00b6 1.a; and (2) an \nunalleged $7,304 loan account.

Because his creditors revoked the settlements and \nreinstated the original balances owed, he had to restart settlement negotiations on the \nother debts \u201cfrom scratch.\u201d Initially, Applicant found it \u201cdifficult\u201d to negotiate settlements \non his own behalf while he remained the sole income earner for his family.

However, she did not begin \u201cdrawing some form of income\u201d \nuntil March 2022, when she became self-employed again in a related but different industry \nthan she worked previously.

He attributed those taxes to the extraordinary amounts \nhe owed initially due to changes in his wife\u2019s employment status, and then to his \nincreasing income bracket. Without specifying either the tax years involved or the \namounts owed, he stated that he resolved all but one $4,500 tax bill via payment plans \nhe negotiated with State B. Although he could not recall the specific tax year to which the \n$4,500 tax bill related, he believed it was one of the last tax years (sometime between \n2017 and 2019) before he relocated back to State A. He attributed his delays in paying \nthe State B taxes to \u201csome missteps, and then things outside of our control happened.\u201d \nHe described his tax payment history to State B as \u201canother contributor\u201d to his overall \nindebtedness. He has not had any post-bankruptcy delinquent federal tax debt. He \nreceived a federal tax refund of \u201cabout $1,000\u201d for tax year 2022, because he keeps his \nexemptions from withholdings \u201cpretty low.\u201d (GE 6 at 2; AE B at 2, 13-14; AE C at 2, 11; \nTr. at 30-31, 62-63, 77, 78) \nOn September 23, 2022, State B accepted his request to repay his final $4,500 tax \nbill via 12 monthly payments of $375, beginning in October 2022. He remained current \nwith those payments through October 2023. However, he owed one more payment in \nNovember 2023, because his August 2023 payment was not processed due to an error \nby State B. (AE B at 2, 13-14; AE C at 2, 11; Tr. at 30-31, 62-63) \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained his debt repayment strategy as follows: \nI started from the top and worked my way down. Some of them are more \nwilling to come to agreements that benefit both parties than other ones. And \nthen I also tried to maybe hit on some of the smaller debts first because I \nwanted to get through the progress, take care of those, and then work my \nway up. But there really wasn't any one [sic]-- none of these are priority over \nthe others, because they're all the debt I owe and hey all needed to be \naddressed. It was really just the order -- I started at the top, and whoever \nwas -- whoever was going to work with me. Ones that wanted $500 and \n$600 a month payments, I had to wait until I had settled some of the other \nones financially, just -- $500 payments, it can be a strain.

(AE C at 2) \nFinancial Information \nApplicant is the primary wage earner for his family. He attributed the progress he \nhas made in resolving his delinquent debts to his salary increases and the addition of his \nwife\u2019s consistent income since March 2022. He estimated that his gross annual salary \nwas about $80,000, upon his hire in 2005. He had been earning about $60,000 with his \nformer employer, which he considered at the time to be a \u201cbigger\u201d salary increase than it \nwas in hindsight. (Tr. at 65-67). \nIn February 2021, Applicant reported his gross annual salary as $135,000, net \nmonthly salary as $6,500, and net monthly remainder as $400. He also expected to \nreceive a $12,000 bonus at the end of 2021. However, at the hearing, he explained, \n\u201cThat's pre-tax, obviously. It gets thrown into a check, and it looks like you made a million \ndollars a year. That $12,000 goes away real fast.\u201d His \u201cbonuses have actually gone down \nfor three straight years.\u201d He recalled that his 2022 gross bonus was about $8,000. He \nrecollected that he \u201cprobably earmarked\u201d both his 2021 and 2022 bonuses toward \nrepaying debts and increasing his savings. (GE 7 at 4-5; Tr. at 74-75, 76) \n\u201cAbout two months\u201d prior to the hearing, Applicant received an increase in his gross \nannual salary to between approximately $160,000 and $165,000. He also received a \n\u201cbump\u201d in salary of about $400 per paycheck while he worked on a long-term assignment \nfor his employer in State C for about a year between 2022 and 2023. He estimated that \nhis wife has earned a gross annual salary of about $20,000 since about March 2022, \nwhich he calculated based on her receiving \u201cabout $400 a week, roughly.\u201d However, he \nacknowledged that, because she only works \u201cabout 20 hours or so\u201d per week, \u201c$400 might \nbe a bit high.\u201d After the hearing, Applicant reported his and his wife\u2019s monthly net income \nas $7,790 and $1,500, respectively. He also reported a net remainder of $126, after he \nmade reported monthly payments totaling $2,164 toward his delinquent debts. There is \nno information in the record about their prior income history. (Tr. at 5, 54-55, 65, 78-81) \nAt the hearing, Applicant advised that he planned to investigate the status of a new \n$7,304 collection account that caught his attention when he reviewed a June 2023 CBR, \nwhich was provided to him a week before the hearing. He was not able to do so prior to \nthe hearing. After the hearing, he confirmed that the new collection account related to an \nold debt, the unalleged $7,304 loan account he previously managed through the DRC, as \ndiscussed above. After negotiating with the creditor for \u201ca couple of months,\u201d he finalized \na settlement agreement on November 15, 2023, reducing the balance owed to $4,650, to \nbe paid via 31 monthly payments of $150, beginning in December 2023.

He actively uses \nonly two personal credit cards to \u201crebuild credit,\u201d on which he pays the balances in full \neach month. Both cards have credit limits of $300.

He carries balances on only two other accounts, on which he timely \nmakes the required monthly payments, including: (1) a personal loan he opened in May \n2023 to pay for hospital fees totaling about $8,500, which were not fully covered by his \ninsurance because he incurred them while he was working in State C; and (2) a vehicle \nloan he refinanced in August 2021 to lower his monthly payment. He chose to use the \nconsumer loan to pay his medical debts because the loan terms \u201cmade sense\u201d to him, \nand to avoid delaying payment to the medical facility. The monthly payments on those \ntwo loans are $298 and $325, respectively.

I can just show \nthe efforts I've made over the last year that kind of aligned with [my wife] \ngoing back to work, which is sort of, we're thinking, for the family. A single-\nincome family is tricky to support a family of five. (Tr. at 53) \nIt's rather embarrassing, quite frankly, to have the education I do and be \nable to some of the technical work but then . . . having issues with my own \npersonal finances. I'd hope that I'd shown that with the wherewithal \nfinancially in my household to address these debts in an expedient manner \nI've done so. I understand that there's still some left, and there's still some \nconcerns we're trying to address. . . And this was a lapse in judgment for a \nprotracted period of time or prolonged.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each debt alleged in the \nSOR, or to be debt free; nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be \nresolved first. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the indebtedness and \nthen take significant actions to implement the plan. \nApplicant began actively working to address his post-bankruptcy indebtedness \nmore than four years before the SOR was issued. He proactively sought professional \nassistance at the first sign of his financial distress in 2018, before his debts became \ndelinquent. Despite not receiving the full benefit from his creditors, he is credited with \nmaking payments totaling $17,887 between June 2018 and December 2019, to address \nhis debts. During that period, he was able to resolve three unalleged debts, which initially \ntotaled $10,997. \nSince terminating the DRC\u2019s services for good cause, Applicant has worked \ndiligently with his creditors to repay his remaining debts within his available means. \nBetween April 2019 and January 2020, before the SOR was issued and despite the \nchallenges of his single-income family, he made consistent monthly payments of \nunknown amounts to resolve three additional unalleged debts, which initially totaled \n$5,745. In May 2022, after his wife became gainfully employed, he paid unknown \namounts to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n, which initially totaled $3,215. \nBetween October 2022 and October 2023, he paid $4,125 toward resolving his remaining \nState B tax debt, and at least $9,919 toward resolving the remaining SOR debts. The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.l through 1.o. have been resolved. \nAlthough not yet resolved, Appellant initiated and is adhering to good-faith efforts to \naddress the debts SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, 1.h through 1.i, and 1.k; his State B tax debt; \nand the unalleged $7,304 loan account. \nIn total, Applicant has paid at least $31,931 toward resolving his indebtedness \nsince 2018, not including the unknown amounts that he also paid. His testimony was \nsincere and credible. He demonstrated responsible actions to address his indebtedness, \nboth before and since it became a security concern. His understanding about finances \nhas evolved. He demonstrated a reformed approach to using credit cards. His decision \nto incur new debt to repay a large medical bill was reasonable under the circumstances. \nHis recent credit report demonstrates that he lives within his means and manages his \nfinances responsibly. The poor judgment and overspending that contributed to his \nindebtedness was not motivated by a willful violation of his financial obligations. His \nprolonged track record of payments and responsible actions lead me to conclude that he \nwill follow through with his plan to fully resolve his remaining delinquent debts and to avoid \nany future indebtedness. \nApplicants\u2019 finances became overextended due to circumstances that were both \nwithin and beyond his control. Since then, he has implemented a reasonable repayment \nplan and has made meaningful progress in implementing that plan over an extended \nperiod. Because the record lacked information sufficient for me to determine how much \nof the resulting indebtedness should be allocated to his poor judgment and overspending, \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nI am unable to conclude that his indebtedness largely resulted from circumstances \nbeyond his control.

Conversely, \nconsidering the responsible way Applicant has addressed his delinquent debts, I am able \nto conclude that his finances are under control, unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Accordingly, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(c), and 20(d) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

She requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). The SOR and Applicant\u2019s answer are the pleadings in the case. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 9, 2023. On July 14, 2023, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for August 29, 2023. Prior to the hearing, the Government \nprovided two exhibits (GE 1\u20132) and Applicant provided ten (AE A-J). \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2 were admitted \nin evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through J were also identified \nand admitted without objection. The record closed at the end of the hearing. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d and provided additional comments in her \nresponse to the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old contractor. She is divorced and has no children. She \nearned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. She has been employed as a contractor since \n2017. (GE 1 at 5-23, Tr. 29-31) \nApplicant works as a senior copy-writing supervisor. In that position, she works on \nprojects that help military members and families find resources to assist them. She is \nmotivated and passionate about her work. (GE 1 at 13-14, AE G & J, Tr. 23-28, 31-32) \nThe allegations in the SOR concern Applicant\u2019s long-term use of marijuana from \nabout October 2006 to about January 2022 and intent to continue use (SOR \u00b6 1.a); her \npurchase of marijuana from about October 2007 to about October 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); her \nuse of cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms during about February 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nand her misuse of the prescription drug codeine from about March 2013 to about \nDecember 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). She admitted all four of the allegations. (SOR Answer) \nIn her SCA, SOR response, subject interview, and her testimony, Applicant \nadmitted using marijuana since about October 2007. She began using it as a teenager \nand has found it improves her mood. She experienced depression in high school and \nturned to marijuana and alcohol to self-medicate. A mental health professional eventually \nproscribed anti-depressants which she found to be effective. She has been open with her \ntherapist and primary care physician regarding her marijuana use and neither expressed \nconcern. Upon legalization in her state, she obtained a medical prescription for marijuana \nand vapes it. She stated her prescription marijuana helps her to feel relaxed, optimistic, \nand peaceful. She last used marijuana the morning of the hearing.

She considers it an \neffective medical treatment for her depression. She stated her employer has a policy \nagainst the use of illegal drugs. She stated her employer occasionally requires urinalysis \nand that though she would expect to test positive for marijuana metabolite, she was not \noverly concerned. (SOR Answer, GE 1 at 41-44, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 14, 47) \nApplicant stated prior to her state legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, she \nwould purchase it on various occasions for personal use from friends or friends of friends. \nShe would occasionally sell small amounts to friends. On average, she purchased a few \ngrams every few months. (GE 1 at 41-43, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 44-46) \nIn about February of 2012, while studying overseas as part of a semester abroad, \nApplicant used cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms. She was offered the mushrooms \nby a friend she was studying with while on a sight-seeing trip and was offered the cocaine \nat a night club. She did not purchase either of them. She tried both. She has not used \nthem since and has no intention of using them again. She is no longer close to the friend \nwho was with her at the time. (SOR Answer, GE 1 at 42-43, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 49-54) \nApplicant tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in late 2012 or early 2013. She \nwas prescribed codeine for pain management. During the treatment period, she did not \nuse all of the codeine. She had four to five pills left after the prescription period ended. \nFrom March through December 2013 Applicant used the remaining four to five codeine \npills for additional pain management. After they were gone, she used Tylenol or ibuprofen. \n(SOR Answer, GE 1 at 44-45, GE 2 at 4, Tr. 54-55) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant has used marijuana with varying frequency, from about October 2006 to \nat least January 2022. She intends to continue to use her medically prescribed marijuana \neven though she acknowledges its use violates federal law. She illegally purchased \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about October 2007 to at least October 2019. She \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nused cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms in about February 2012. She used four to \nfive prescription codeine pills after her prescription for them had expired. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term use of marijuana, use of cocaine and hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, and expired codeine satisfy AG \u00b6 25(a). The illegal use of marijuana, a \nSchedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), alone constitutes substance \nmisuse. Her illegal purchase of marijuana satisfies AG \u00b6 25(c). Finally, her expressed \nintent to continue marijuana use satisfies AG \u00b6 25(g). \nNext, I considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nConsidering the evidence, none of the mitigating conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\nb. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is frequent, ongoing, and she intends to continue her use. \nShe admitted she had last used marijuana the before the hearing. I did not consider this \nas disqualifying as it was not alleged, however, I did weigh it in considering mitigation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a closer call as Applicant\u2019s purchases of marijuana since legalization in her \nstate in 2019 are legal under state law, however, they remain illegal under federal law. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhallucinogenic mushrooms in February 2012 occurred over 11 years ago, when she was \nin college studying overseas, she did not purchase them, and has no desire to use them \nagain. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c is mitigated. Applicant\u2019s use of four to five codeine pills prescribed \nto her outside of the prescription period to relieve pain was ten years ago. I find SOR \u00b6 \n1.d is also mitigated. \nMarijuana use and possession remains prohibited under federal law. \u201cMedical \nmarijuana has no special or preferred status under either the adjudicative guidelines or \nthe new clarifying guidance. \u201c[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation . . . .\u201d SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 2.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb 1, 2022). \nApplicant\u2019s candor is commendable and I weighed that in her favor. All of the \nallegations in the SOR were known only because she disclosed them on her SCA. \nNonetheless, Applicant admits she knows marijuana use is prohibited under federal law. \nShe has used marijuana consistently for nearly 17 years. This behavior raises substantial \nquestions about her judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Viewed as a whole, her conduct raises eligibility concerns, such as poor \njudgment, that are broader than her marijuana use. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns about her drug involvement and substance \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nmisuse, which includes an expressed intent to continue use.

On \nSeptember 2, 2022, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), \nthe Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on September 7, 2022, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was previously assigned \nto another administrative judge, but reassigned to me on February 13, 2023.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Bachelor \nof Science degree. Applicant has been employed with the defense contractor since \nJanuary of 2016. He is divorced, and has no children. (TR at page 7 lines 10~24, and \nat page 15 line 1 to page 16 line 9, and GX 1 at pages 7, 13~14, 15, 25~26 and 27~28.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.a.

For this employment, in the last \nseven (7) years have you received a written warning . . .\u201d  Again, in his Answer, \nApplicant avers it \u201cwas an accidental omission.\u201d (Answer at page 7.) This explanation is \nnot credible. In about 2016, Applicant received a written warning from his employer for \ncharging more than $4,000 on his company credit card for personal purchases. (TR at \npage 21 line 11 to page 23 line 25, at page 54 line 16 to page 55 line 11, at page 56 line \n15 to page 57 line 18, and GX 1 at pages 15~16.) I find this to be a willful falsification. \n1.c. and 1.d. These allegations relate to the same incident. Applicant admits that \nin about February of 1981 he was charged with Suspicion of Burglary. (TR at page 24 \nline 1 to page 25 line 15.) I find that this event that occurred more than 40 years ago \ndoes not have present security significance under Personal Conduct. \n1.e. Applicant admits that in about February of 1995 he was charged with illegal \nPossession of a Firearm. (TR at page 25 line 16 to page 26 line 17.) I find that this \nevent that occurred more than 28 years ago does not have present security significance \nunder Personal Conduct. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n2.a. and 2.b. Applicant admits that he used marijuana, sometimes on a daily \nbasis, from about 1978 until about June of 2019, a period of more than 40 years. He \nestimates his usage to be between 1,000~10,000 times. Applicant also purchased the \nmarijuana he used, knowing that for the vast majority of the 40 years his use and \npurchases were illegal. (TR at page 20 lines 10~22, at page 47 line 25 to page 49 line \n15, and at page 53 lines 16~19.) \n2.c. Applicant admits that in September of 2017 he was cited for Possession of a \nControlled Substance, i.e., Psilocybin Mushrooms. (TR at page 49 line 16 to page 50 \nline 3, and at page 66 lines 18~24.) \n2.d. Applicant admits that in about November of 1980, in California, he was \ncharged with Possession of Concentrated Cannabis. (TR at page 50 lines 4~6.) \n2.e Applicant admits that in about January of 1987, in California, he was charged \nwith Plant Marijuana. (TR at page 50 lines 10~13.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nApplicant falsified his February 2020 SCA in his answers to two posited \nquestions. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. It is not reasonable to believe that \nApplicant forgot that he used marijuana, perhaps thousands of times, during the time \nperiod in question. It is also incredible that he did not remember that he received a \nwritten warning from his employer, for misuse of his company credit card, in an amount \nin excess of $4,000. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked and purchased marijuana over a period of more than 40 years. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. It is too soon to find that Applicant\u2019s extensive use of \nmarijuana is not of present security significance. Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is found against Applicant \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppXs A~II.) However, overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.~1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.~ 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant stated that he would use marijuana about \neight to nine times a month. \nHe would use it with his brother and their friends. \nMarijuana would make him feel calm and less irritated. From about November 2021 to \nabout January 2022, Applicant has used marijuana about seven times after completing \nhis security clearance application dated November 16, 2021. Applicant usually obtained \nmarijuana from co-workers, or at school, and when it became legal in his state, he \npurchased it at a dispensary. Applicant has never received any treatment for drug \nabuse. People who know about his marijuana use are the people he smokes with. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn his security clearance application dated November 16, 2021, Applicant \nexplained that he uses marijuana for anxiety purposes induced by stress. He normally \nuses it on weekends about twice a day. Sometimes he over thinks situations and \nmarijuana helps to prevent this. He stated that he has no intent to use marijuana in the \nfuture. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nDuring an interview with a Federal investigator on January 27, 2022, Applicant \nconfirmed his use of marijuana between May 2019 and January 22, 2022. He stated \nthat he last used it at a techno concert. He also disclosed that since completing his \nsecurity clearance application on November 16, 2021, he has continued to use \nmarijuana, at least seven times total. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nIn response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories dated July 21, 2022, Applicant \nstated that he had no intent for future use of marijuana due to the nature of the job he \nenjoys. His job brings less stress to his life. He is also motivated to live a healthier life. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. \nApplicant has a history of \nmarijuana use from May 2019 to at least January 2022. In his security clearance \napplication dated November 16, 2021, Applicant stated that he has no intent to continue \nusing marijuana in the future. Despite being on noticed that use of illegal drugs is a \nsecurity concern, Applicant continued to use marijuana. \nHe used it approximately \nseven times per month after completing his security clearance application at least up \nuntil January 2022. While talking with the Federal investigator, Applicant was asked \nwhy he wrote in the security clearance application that he intends to stop using \nmarijuana, and he responded, \u201cthat was the plan and he did not follow through with it.\u201d \nApplicant continues to socialize with people who use marijuana. \nAlthough he has \nindicated a desire to stop using marijuana, he has not demonstrated that he can stop \nusing it. He understands that it is illegal and prohibited by the Department of Defense, \nbut has disregarded Federal law for his convenience. Applicant\u2019s recent actions cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Under the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the maturity level, integrity, and reliability necessary to access \nclassified information. Applicant does not meet the eligibility qualifications for a security \nclearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant understands the requirements \nassociated with holding a security clearance and knowns that marijuana use is not \ntolerated. Applicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be confident to \nknow that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when \nno one is looking. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He did not pay the $867 fine and civil assessment that was \nimposed for the first offense, which resulted in the court sending the debt to a collection \nagency in June 2021. (Items 7 \u2013 8) He admits that he drove his car without a current \nregistration. He continued to drive the car after receiving a citation because it was the \nonly way he could get to work. Although he claims he paid the fines and civil assessment, \nhe did not provide proof that it was paid. (Item 6 at 9-11) In his Response to the SOR, \nApplicant denied this allegation, stating that he was not aware of this issue. (Item 2) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant claims he misunderstood the questions \nregarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b \u2013 2.d. In other words, he did not intentionally withhold any \ninformation on his security clearance application. On April 30, 2020, he was interviewed \nby an investigator in conjunction with his security clearance background investigation. \nThe investigator questioned him about his employment with Employer A, specifically \nwhether he ever received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, or terminated. Applicant replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The \ninvestigator confronted him with information that Employer A fired him because he failed \na post-accident drug screen. Once confronted, Applicant admitted to having a positive \ndrug test for marijuana in November or December 2019. He said Employer A allowed him \nto resign in lieu of being terminated. He admitted to using marijuana on one occasion to \ntreat back pain after he hurt his back at work. Employer A later sent him to an urgent care \nclinic to have his back checked because it was a work-related injury. Applicant was \nrequired to provide a urine sample as part of the treatment. The sample tested positive \nfor marijuana. (Item 6 at 7-8) \nA few days later, Applicant\u2019s supervisor informed him that he violated the drug \npolicy and would be terminated. He told his supervisor that he would resign because he \nneeded a better paying job. He believed his employment record with Company A would \nindicate he resigned. He did not list his termination on the January 2020 SCA because \nhe did not believe he was terminated. He claims he only used marijuana on one occasion. \nHe has not used marijuana since. He is aware that he is not allowed to use marijuana or \nother drugs while holding a security clearance. (Item 6 at 8) \nThe investigator who interviewed Applicant prepared an unsworn summary of \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Subject Interview. On September 18, 2022, Applicant certified that \nthe unsworn summary of his April 30, 2020 personal subject interview was accurate in \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories.

While Applicant denied failing \u201ca \nscheduled or random drug test\u201d in response question 8 on interrogatories sent to him by \nthe Department of Defense on November 9, 2021, he previously admitted to testing \npositive for marijuana during a work-related urinalysis during his personal subject \ninterview on April 30, 2020. The Government was on notice that Applicant failed a \nurinalysis test. His incorrect answer to question 8 on the November 2021 Interrogatory \nwas not material because he admitted his failed urinalysis during his personal subject \ninterview after being confronted by the background investigator. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse under AG \u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant possessed and used marijuana on one \noccasion to treat his back pain after a work-related injury. His illegal use of marijuana \nresulted in a positive urinalysis test during his employment with Employer A. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \n25(b), and 25(c) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, \n2005)) \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \ncondition under AG \u00b6 26 potentially applies: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant used marijuana on one occasion after suffering a back injury at work. \nThis incident occurred four years ago.

AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. The concern under Guideline \nH is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. The following will normally result in an \nunfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but \nis not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana \nuse, positive urinalysis, and resignation in lieu of being terminated occurred a few months  \nbefore he completed his January 2020 security clearance application.

The questions in Section 13A \u2013 \nEmployment Activities, and Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity were clear.  \nI cannot conclude Applicant misunderstood these questions. I also note that Applicant did \nnot disclose his illegal marijuana use, positive urinalysis and termination from Employer \nA, until he was confronted by the investigator with the facts during his April 2020 \nbackground investigation interview. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies with respect to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.e. Applicant\u2019s past \nconduct has shown a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. He failed to follow his \nworkplace drug testing policy, which resulted in his termination in 2019. He also failed to \nfollow his state traffic laws, specifically, he failed to renew his automobile registration and \ncontinued to drive his unregistered automobile. He initially received a citation for this \noffense in March 2019. He continued to drive his unregistered car and received another \ncitation in November 2019. He was found guilty and was fined and received a civil \nassessment. He did not prove he paid the fines and civil assessments. His failure to follow \nrules raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17 potentially apply \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications \nregarding his illegal marijuana use and subsequent termination by Employer A on his \nJanuary 2020 SCA, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. During his personal subject \ninterview, he did not admit that he used marijuana and later tested positive for marijuana \nin a subsequent urinalysis until he was confronted about it. While he believed he was \nallowed to resign rather than be fired from Employer A, he should have answered \naffirmatively in response to Section 13A - Employment Activities, with regard to whether \nin the last 7 years had he ever been fired, or quit after being told you would be fired? He \ndid not volunteer this information until he was confronted by the investigator conducting \nhis background investigation interview. He did not make a prompt good-faith effort to \ncorrect his falsehoods before being confronted with the facts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s falsifications on his SCA are not \nconsidered minor. A person applying for a security clearance is expected to be truthful \nwith the Government at all times. Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications on his SCA \nregarding his illegal marijuana use and his subsequent termination from Employer A \nraises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply because Applicant has a history of rule violations that \nraise questions about his reliability and judgment. He has not demonstrated any steps \ntaken to prevent future rule violations. In fact, the fines for the traffic citation alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e remain outstanding. \nApplicant did not mitigate the concerns raised under Personal Conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in \nthis whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service with the United States Army. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use occurred more than four years ago. There is no evidence \nin the record indicating that Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred more than one \ntime. I find for Applicant related to the concerns raised under Guideline H. \nMore concerning is Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his illegal drug use \nand subsequent termination from Employer A on his January 2020 SCA. This occurred \njust two months after he was terminated by Employer A for testing positive for marijuana \nduring a urinalysis test. He did not admit to these issues until he was confronted by the \ninvestigator conducting his background investigation. With the exception of SOR \u00b6 2.b, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nall allegations under Guideline E raise questions about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness and \nreliability. Overall, I conclude the concerns under personal conduct are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.c -2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(Tr. 33, 107) He said the last time he used \nmethamphetamine was around the 2019 DUI arrest when methamphetamine were found \nin his pocket. (Tr. 107) He does not associate with the woman who gave him \nmethamphetamine. (Tr. 107) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant used cocaine with varying frequency from about \nDecember 1993 to about December 1996.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(d). AG \u00b6 25(b) is not established \nbecause Department Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.e.

Additional discussion of the disqualifying conditions is in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The \npolice report for his May 20, 2019 arrest states that the police officer noticed the smell of \nmarijuana emanating from Applicant\u2019s vehicle, and he asked Applicant when he last \nsmoked marijuana, and Applicant told the police officer that he had \u201ca few hits from a \njoint\u201d about five hours earlier. (GE 8 at 2) The police officer asked Applicant how often he \nsmoked marijuana, and Applicant initially said he smoked weekly, and then he clarified, \n\u201che smoked nightly before bed.\u201d (Id.) A September 2, 2020 progress note for his drug and \nalcohol treatment, said Applicant \u201csmokes nightly\u201d and \u201cstarted out smoking on weekends \nthen smoke before bedtime.\u201d (GE 11 at 2, 4) He also indicated he stopped using \nmarijuana. (GE 11) A substance use treatment summary states: \n[Applicant] reports smoking marijuana for the first time at age 18, and \nbecame a regular user at age 20 when he would use cannabis on \nweekends. He reports his cannabis use to have decreased in the past 10 \nyears. His last reported use was in May 2019 when he would occasionally \nuse cannabis at nighttime for relaxing. (GE 11 at 6)   \nI find that the most accurate and truthful description of Applicant\u2019s history of abuse \nof illegal drugs occurred when he was seeking treatment for his drug abuse. The police \nofficer\u2019s statement provides corroboration for the 2020 progress note. Applicant said at \nhis hearing that he also used methamphetamine two or three times.

He used marijuana and methamphetamine after he completed his \n2018 SCA and while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. His cocaine use in the \n1990s is not recent, and there is no evidence of subsequent cocaine use. He used \nmethamphetamine two or three times with the most recent use possession and use \noccurring on May 20, 2019. His methamphetamine possession and use are not recent. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are mitigated. He provided evidence of actions taken to overcome his \ninvolvement. He attended and successfully completed substance abuse counseling. He \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s statement of intent to refrain from future marijuana use is not \nreliable because of his falsifications of security documents, discussed infra. His credibility \nwas damaged when he falsified his SCAs in 2018 and 2020 and his 2022 DOHA \ninterrogatories. Applicant wrote in his response to the DOHA interrogatory about his \nhistory of drug involvement that he used methamphetamine twice in October 2017, and \nmarijuana four times in May 2019. Because of these intentional false statements, I do not \nbelieve his statements about refraining from marijuana possession and use since 2019 or \n2020. See ISCR Case No. 22-00657 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 18, 2023) (reversing judge\u2019s \nmitigation of drug involvement and substance misuse concerns stating, \u201cHaving found that \nApplicant deliberately falsified not one, but two security clearance applications, the Judge \nimplicitly opined about Applicant\u2019s lack of trustworthiness and [failed to explain] his \nreasons for believing her most recent claim of abstinence and the promises advanced in \nher Statement of Intent.\u201d) Applicant provided urine samples on September 15, 2020, and \nAugust 25, 2023, which tested negative for the use of illegal drugs; however, he may have \nreceived advance notice of the tests, and they may not show a substantial period of \nabstinence of illegal drug use because detection windows are limited for urinalysis tests. \nI am not convinced Applicant\u2019s marijuana possession and use \u201chappened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). His marijuana involvement \ncontinues to \u201ccast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d \n(Id.)

Discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant\u2019s possessions of marijuana, cocaine, and \nmethamphetamine are criminal offenses. His multiple marijuana possessions are not \nmitigated; however, his multiple cocaine and methamphetamine possessions are \nmitigated because they are not recent. \nAmended SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that on or about May 20, 2019, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with DUI; however, he was convicted of a lesser offense. His blood test \nshowed THC use, and marijuana possession is a criminal offense. \nAmended SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges on about March 23, 2017, Applicant was \u201carrested for \nand charged with two counts of Domestic Violence Assault, 4th degree. He pleaded guilty \nto the two assaults. These two crimes are substantiated; however, they are not recent, \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand there is no proof similar offenses have recurred.

This offense is not substantiated. \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications of security documents, discussed infra, are not used for \ndisqualification; however, they show lack of credibility and rehabilitation. None of the \nmitigating offenses apply to all SOR allegations. In sum, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are not \nmitigated, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d are mitigated. Criminal conduct concerns are not \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one personal conduct condition that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in relation to his provision of inaccurate information on \nhis SCA: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsely denied that he had ever used marijuana on his April 19, 2018, \nand September 30, 2020 SCAs. He said he only used marijuana four times on his August \n9, 2022 response to Interrogatories. Applicant said he did not deliberately and \nintentionally provide false information in his SCAs and in his DOHA interrogatories. He \nhurried through the SCAs without carefully reviewing his responses to the questions. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nI conclude that Applicant knowingly and intentionally provided false information \nabout his history of marijuana use. In his two SCAs, he denied any marijuana use. He \ninformed medical personnel that he frequently used marijuana, and he was diagnosed \nwith Substance Use Disorder. In his April 19, 2018 SCA, he disclosed treatment for \u201cTHC \n(Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.)\u201d in January 2005; however, this disclosure \nis insufficient to show he acted in good faith when he denied that he ever used marijuana. \nThe April 19, 2018 SCA does not include any information about his marijuana use while \nholding a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes five conditions which could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. His falsifications of security documents \nare recent, repeated, serious, and intentional. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H, J, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old maintenance technician who has worked for federal \ncontractors since 2009. In 2005, he completed an apprenticeship. His resume and \nbiography provide additional details about his background and professional experience. \nFor many years, Applicant was an elite athlete who competed in international \ncompetitions on behalf of the United States. As part of his sports career, he met the \nPresident and First Lady at the White House. He has held a security clearance since \n2009. \nApplicant loves his job, and he would like to continue in his current employment. \nHe received a coin and a letter of appreciation from his employer for voluntarily working \novertime, showing initiative. and resolving problems. He provided 12 character \nstatements from friends, family, and coworkers. The general sense of their statements is \nthat he is friendly, hardworking, honest, and family oriented. The character evidence \nsupports reinstatement of his security clearance. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive. Applicant \npossessed and used marijuana on many occasions, including while holding a security \nclearance. His decisions to repeatedly possess and use marijuana is an indication he \nlacks the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. He falsely denied \nthat he had ever used marijuana on his April 19, 2018 and September 30, 2020 SCAs. \nHe said he only used marijuana four times on his August 9, 2022 response to \nInterrogatories. These statements are not true, and Applicant knew they were not true \nwhen he made them. \nA failure of an applicant to provide honest and candid self-reports of derogatory \ninformation on security documents is an important indication that, if granted security \nclearance eligibility, that applicant would likely not disclose any threats to national \nsecurity, if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or \npersonal reputation. \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the four SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d) but asserted that \u00b6 1.c was a duplicate of \u00b6 1.b. Her admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old. She was married from 1984 through 1994, when she and her husband divorced. She has a son and a daughter. She has been employed as a financial analyst for a consulting company since 2020. She has held similar jobs in that field, as a federal contractor from 2007 through 2014 and 2014 through 2020. She has held a clearance since September 2018. (Item 2) 2 Applicant reported on her SCA that she had some delinquent debts, stating \u201cI got behind on some of my bills and I am working on catching up.\u201d She disclosed several debts, including a $22,000 voluntary repossession of a vehicle in about December 2014.

(Item 1) With her SOR \nresponse, she also provided seven pages of documents, including excerpts from a credit \nreport (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) and two emails regarding debt payments (AE B). \nOn September 22, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 5. \nDOHA mailed the FORM to Applicant the next day, and she received it on October 28, \n2022.

(Item \n4 at 3, Item 5 at 2) During her first background interview, she indicated that she had taken \nno action to address the debt with the creditor since the repossession and was not willing \nto do so. She said she hoped the debt would fall from her credit report. In her Answer to \nthe SOR, she admitted the debt, and noted that it should \u201cfall off my credit report by March \n2023,\u201d seven years after it appeared. (Item 1) She also provided a credit report excerpt \nnoting the debt. (AE A) (Item 3 at 2) \nIn her SOR Reply, Applicant said the debt had fallen off of her credit report and \nprovided recent credit reports as proof. (AE J, AE K, AE L) She explained that her \ndaughter became pregnant in 2015 and Applicant moved into a larger house with her \ndaughter and the daughter\u2019s then-boyfriend with an agreement that they would share \ncosts. They failed to do so. Applicant had to absorb all the costs herself, leading her to \nfall behind on this debt and others. (SOR Reply; Item 3 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($3,786) is an account placed for collection by a credit union. As of \nNovember 2021, this account, # 512362, had a balance of $4,114. (Item 3 at 4); as of \nJune 2022, this account had a balance of $3,786, as alleged. (Item 5 at 2) Applicant \nprovided documents with her Answer and SOR Reply showing that she made payments \nof $100, $150, $100, $150, and $150 between January and October 2022. (AE B \u2013 AE \nH) This account is being paid.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,662) is an account charged off by the same credit union as the \ncreditor for SOR \u00b6 1.b. This account, # 5570XXXXXXXX4535, is listed on both credit \nreports (Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 2) Applicant asserted that she has had only one account \nwith this credit union and said she had disputed the account. (AE A; SOR Reply) She \ncited the Equifax credit report, noting account number 4535. This account is listed on that \nreport, as charged off with a balance of $2,662, as alleged. (AE K at 28) This account \ndoes not appear on the other November 2022 credit reports. (AE J, AE L) Based on the \ninformation in the credit report, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c appear to be two separate accounts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($176) is a retail credit account that has been charged off. (Item 4 at 3 \nItem 5 at 2) It has been paid. (AE A, AE I) \nIn her background interview, Applicant said she had not prioritized her debts but \nfor the ones for which she had set up payment plans, because she could not afford it.

She had not taken on new debt but did not have \na budget or a financial plan. (Item 3 at 5) There is no indication that she has participated \nin financial counseling, per se, but she is a professional financial analyst, so she likely \nhas had professional financial training. Applicant gave no details about her current \nfinances in her SOR Reply beyond her credit reports, which largely show that she is \ncurrent on her payments. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant fell behind on her debts in 2014 or 2015, after her daughter and her \ndaughter\u2019s boyfriend moved in with their child. Her debts are established by the credit \nreports in the record, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The record did not establish that they \nare the same debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some application. Applicant incurred these debts several years \nago, while she was helping out her family financially. Her current credit reports show good \nfinancial stability. SOR \u00b6 1.a, the repossession debt, however, is still a \u201ccontinuing course \nof conduct\u201d as it is an ongoing, unresolved delinquent debt, so it can be considered recent \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplicant experienced financial problems and fell behind on her debts several \nyears ago after she took in her daughter, her daughter\u2019s boyfriend and their child, and \nassumed full financial responsibility for them. They had agreed to help out but did not do \nso. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application given this circumstance beyond her control.  \nApplicant returned a vehicle but was left with a $22,000 balance afterwards. She \ntook no action to inquire about the debt with the creditor since then, and said she did not \nintend to do, in the hopes that it would fall off of her credit reports. The Appeal Board has \nheld that a debt dropping from a credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution. ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016). Applicant has not \nundertaken good-faith, reasonable efforts to address SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is being paid and SOR \u00b6 1.d has been paid. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those \ndebts. Applicant did not establish that SOR \u00b6 1.c is the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.b. These \ntwo debts have different account numbers and are listed separately on both credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government.

Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit \nany response. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.l), except for \u00b6 \n1.d. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since November 2019, as an information systems security officer. Since \n2004, he has worked for various federal contractors. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nis married, since December 2020, and has one minor child. He has held a security \nclearance since approximately 2002. (Items 2-3). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013, resulting \nin a discharge in July 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); incurred nine delinquent debts, comprised of \nstudent loans and consumer debts totaling $177,801 (of which approximately $160,000 \nderive from his student loans) (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j); and failed to file his 2019 and 2020 federal \nand state income tax returns (\u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.l). \nCourt records establish that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013 \nand his dischargeable debts were discharged later that year. He listed assets of \napproximately $65,000 and liabilities of over $181,000 in his petition. Included in his \nliabilities, were approximately $100,000 of delinquent student loans. They were not \ndischarged. Applicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. \n(Items 3-4, 11) \nApplicant admitted having delinquent student loans of approximately $159,000 in \nhis SOR answer. He further stated that he was \u201cPending to make arrangements for \nmonthly payments.\u201d He failed to provide any evidence that he set up any payment plans \nfor his student loans. His student loans were initially placed in collection in June 2014. \nApplicant claimed the loans were then put in deferment for a period. They were \nsubsequently placed in collection in June 2018. (Items 4, 6, 8; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted failing to file his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He claimed the reason he failed to file was because he owed federal taxes in \nthe amount of over $6,000 and he did not have the funds to pay. He produced no \nevidence that he has subsequently filed his federal and state tax returns. Since \nApplicant\u2019s owing of federal taxes for 2019 was not alleged in the SOR, I will not use \nthat information for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it as it relates to the \napplicability of any mitigating conditions and in my whole-person assessment.

(\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.j) He admitted these debts in his background \ninterview and in his SOR answer, except for \u00b6 1.d, which he denied. That debt no longer \nappears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports and is resolved for him. The remaining debts are \nreported as delinquent debts in credit reports from February 2020, July 2021, and \nNovember 2022. He provided no documentary evidence showing that he contacted the \ncreditors, established payment plans, or paid any of the remaining debts. (Items 3-8; \nSOR answer) \nApplicant cited a number of reasons leading to his financial difficulties. These \nreasons included being told to reestablish his credit after his bankruptcy by using credit \ncards, experiencing job layoffs, having low paying jobs, being involved in a serious car \naccident, and having to deal with the death of his parents. He indicated that he sought \nfinancial counseling with a debt relief company, but failed to produce any documentation \nreflecting any actions he or the company took on his behalf. Applicant stated during his \nbackground interview in October 2021, that his net monthly income is $2,576 and total \nmonthly expenses of $4,880, leaving a monthly deficit of $2,123. (Items 3-4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had debts discharged by bankruptcy in 2013, has over $150,000 of \ndelinquent student loans, failed to pay other consumer debts, and failed to file his 2019 \nand 2020 federal and state income tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and remain unresolved, with the exception of \u00b6 \n1.d, which is resolved in his favor. His federal and state tax returns remain unfiled for \ntax years 2019-2020. He did not provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. On the contrary, he currently operates at a monthly \ndeficit, spending more each month than he earns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He \nnamed several circumstances that were beyond his control that contributed to his \nfinancial problems, however, the evidence does not support a finding that he has taken \nresponsible actions to address his debts or timely file his federal and state tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \nstudent loans. He received financial counseling through bankruptcy and also hired a \ndebt resolution company. Despite these actions, his financial conditions are not under \ncontrol. He has not shown a good-faith effort to address his debts or his federal and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstate tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) partially applies, but 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply, except \nas noted above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his personal issues, but I \nalso considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts, and his failure to timely file \nhis 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. Applicant has not established a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Personal conduct security concerns \narising from his alleged failure to disclose delinquencies on his security clearance \napplication are not established. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 24, 2021. \n(Item 2) On July 20, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. The CAF \nissued the SOR under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. (Item 1) On September \n20, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. DOHA mailed the \nFORM to Applicant on September 22, 2022, and he received it on September 30, 2022. \nHe was afforded 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. On an unspecified subsequent date, he submitted a response (FORM \nResponse), which included exhibits about his taxes (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) T-1 through \nT-8), his student loans (AE A1 through A12), and other debts (AE D1 through D5). I have \nkept the exhibit numbering system Applicant used in his FORM Response. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s exhibits, and Applicant did not \nobject to admission of the Government\u2019s exhibits. \nThe case was assigned to me on December 2, 2022. The SOR and the Answer \n(combined as Item 1) are the pleadings in this case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s FORM Response and exhibits are all admitted \ninto evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and \n1.m; and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, the financial allegations under Guideline F. \nHe denied \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 2.a and 2.b, the falsification allegations under Guideline E. He \nprovided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are \nincorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is not married and he has no children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but \nhas not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until \nhe was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early \n2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to \nSeptember 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology \ncompany. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job. \nHe has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016. (Items 2, 3) \nGuideline F \nThe SOR debts total about $52,000. They include about $30,000 in past-due \nfederal student loans, about $20,000 in past-due federal income taxes, and about $2,000 \nin other past-due debts. The record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs) from June 2022 \nand November 2021 (Items 5, 6), which, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions, establish the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his August 2021 SCA. He \ndiscussed his taxes and other debts during his November 2021 background interview \n(see discussion under Guideline E, below), and he provided updated information in a May \n2022 interrogatory response. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($4,774), 1.b ($4,680), 1.c ($4,429), 1.d ($3,915), 1.e ($3,734), 1.f \n($3,567), 1.g ($2,736), 1.h ($1,617), and 1.j ($587) are Applicant\u2019s past-due federal \nstudent loans, which, as noted, total about $30,000 combined. \nApplicant explained that he attended college between ages 19 and 24 and needed \nfinancial aid in order to do so. To stay qualified for financial aid, he had to keep his grades \nup, both in college and while later attending community college. He failed to do that, so \nhe attempted to work his way through school. He then successfully pursued an \ninformation technology (IT) certification, and has been with his employer, a government \ncontractor, in his field, ever since. However, he did not earn enough to pay expenses and \nto address his student loan re-payments as well, so he fell behind, and they became \ndelinquent. (Answer, Item 2) \nWhen Applicant contacted the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) in late July \n2022 to ascertain the status of his loans, he was told they were in collection status and \nhe had to file a \u201cDebt Resolution\u201d form to rehabilitate them, pay them in full, or consolidate \nthem. Applicant said he applied to rehabilitate his federal student loans by the end of July \n2022. Once approved, he would be required to make 9 or 10 timely consecutive monthly \npayments to achieve loan rehabilitation. (Answer, Item 2) \nApplicant provided relevant documentation with his FORM Response. He was \napproved for an income-based repayment plan of $5 per month. As of October 2022, he \nmade two $5 payments, in August and September 2022. His loans remained in \u201cdefault\u201d \nstatus as of October 2022, when they were transferred to another loan servicer. (AE A1 \n\u2013 AE A6) \nOn October 15, 2022, Applicant applied for forgiveness of up to $20,000 of his \nfederal student loans under the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s student debt relief plan. (AE \nA7 \u2013 AE A10). That plan was subsequently challenged in federal court, and as of this \nwriting, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is pending. Additionally, the repayment of \nseveral federal student loans have been in forbearance status due to the COVID-19 \npandemic under multiple Presidential Executive Orders since March 2020. Federal \nstudent loan payments remain paused until at least June 30, 2023, and perhaps beyond, \ndue to the Supreme Court case. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($700) is an account placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant asserted in his Answer that the account was paid in full and he later provided \ncorroborating documentation. (Item 1; FORM Response; AE D1) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,164) is an account placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denies \nthis debt, and notes that the account was not listed on a July 2022 credit report. That \ncredit report is not in evidence, but the debt is also not listed on a June 2022 credit report \n(Item 5). It is only listed on an earlier credit report, from November 2021. (Item 6) With his \nFORM Response, Applicant provides a credit card excerpt showing that his account with \nthe bank, which has a credit limit of $1,000 and a highest balance of $1,160, is in good \nstanding. (FORM Response; AE D5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($367) is an account placed for collection by a jeweler. (Item 5) Applicant \ndenies the debt and says he has disputed it with the credit bureaus. (Item 2) \nDocumentation he later provided verified his dispute but also the credit bureau\u2019s \nconclusion that the account was valid: \u201cThe information you disputed has been verified \nas accurate.\u201d (AE D2, AE D3) This account is established and remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($20,000) concerns Applicant\u2019s past-due federal income taxes for tax \nyear (TY) 2019. Applicant admitted the allegation with an explanation. He did not disclose \nany federal income tax debt on his August 2021 SCA, but he reported in his November \n2021 background interview that, in November 2021, he received a letter from the U.S. \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that he owed $20,000 in federal income taxes from \nTY 2019. He said he did not list it on his SCA because he had just found out about it. \n(Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant lives in a state on the U.S. east coast. He indicated in his Answer that \nhis 2019 tax returns were prepared by a tax preparer, Ms. M, in a state in the \nsouthwestern U.S., with a nationally known tax preparation service. The reason why he \nretained an out-of-state tax preparer is not provided. He asserted that he had never owed \ntaxes in the past and owing taxes for TY 2019 was out of character. (Answer, Item 2) \nWith his FORM Response, Applicant provided a series of text messages between \nhimself and Ms. M, apparently from earlier in 2022, in which he repeatedly sought \ninformation on the status of his taxes, noting that his clearance was in jeopardy. (FORM \nResponse; AE T-1 to AE T-7) Ms. M provided a letter (undated, though probably from \n2022), noting that she is her own tax preparation service (in the southwestern state). She \nexplained that Applicant retained her in mid-January 2022 \u201cto settle any clerical errors \nthat involve [Applicant] and his 2019 federal taxes.\u201d She asserted that he first contacted \nher in November 2021 after he received a letter from the IRS. She asserted that he does \nnot owe any taxes and the error resulted from \u201cthe removal of the Earned Income Tax \nCredit\u201d for 2019 due to verification of his employment. She asserted that she expects the \nIRS will soon verify that the problem has been corrected and that Applicant will receive a \nrefund instead of owing past-due taxes. (AE T-8) Ms. M provides no documentation about \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 federal taxes, to include any tax return, correspondence, or \ndocumentation of her interactions with the IRS to resolve the matter. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) with his May 2022 \ninterrogatory response. He reported net monthly income of just under $3,500 and monthly \nexpenses and debt payments of a combined $3,525, leaving a small negative remainder. \nHe did not list any payments for his SOR debts on his PFS. (Item 4) \nGuideline E \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. (Item 2) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose that information, in answer to certain questions about his financial \nrecord. Applicant denied the allegations of deliberate falsification. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a concerns the following two questions on Applicant\u2019s August 2021 SCA \nunder: \nSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine \nAccounts: Other than previously listed, have any of the following \nhappened?: \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection\nagency\u201d [and] \n \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. \nAll of the debts Applicant allegedly omitted (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.j-1.l) are debts that \nwere turned over to a collection agency. (Items 5, 6) None of them involved suspended, \ncharged-off, or cancelled accounts. Thus, as to SOR \u00b6 2.a, only the first question above \nis applicable. \nApplicant said he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his USDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but \n[says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were in collections.\u201d He recalled applying for \nrepayment and forbearance. He denied intentional falsification, noting his belief that \u201cthe \nsecurity department\u201d had access to that information \u201cbecause the loans belong to the \nUnited States Federal Government.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b concerns Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose that he had failed to pay \nhis $20,000 in federal taxes from TY 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) As to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant said \nhe was advised by his tax preparer \u201cto not accept fault until it was 100% determined that \nI actually owe.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nIn his background interview, Applicant voluntarily disclosed the November 2021 \nletter he received from the IRS and noted that he had only then learned about his $20,000 \ntax debt for TY 2019. Applicant then denied any other delinquencies, before being \nconfronted with his federal student loans in collection, along with his other past-due debts. \n(Item 3 at 5) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise financial security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant incurred about $30,000 in past-due federal student loans and some other \ndelinquencies. The debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nIn November 2021, Applicant received a letter from the IRS regarding $20,000 in \npast-due federal income taxes for TY 2019. The letter is not in the record, but he disclosed \nthe matter in his November 2021 background interview and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.m, \nconcerning that debt. That admission and disclosure is sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) \nand 19(f) as to SOR \u00b6 1.m. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans remained past due and in default status at the \ntime he responded to the FORM. He has not yet resolved or successfully disputed his \n$20,000 federal tax debt from TY 2019. These debts remain ongoing and unresolved. As \nsuch, they continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should \napply. Similarly, he has not shown under AG \u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. Applicant has not participated in credit \ncounseling and has not established that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant challenges the IRS\u2019s conclusion that he owes $19,000 in past-due taxes \nfrom TY 2019, but he provided insufficient evidence, such as corroborating \ndocumentation, to support his claim. The uncorroborated opinion of his tax preparer that \nhe will eventually receive a refund is insufficient. Applicant also challenge the validity of \nthe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.l and was told that the debt remains valid. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence, particularly documentary evidence, \nto establish that he \u201chas made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. Under Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to disclose that information, in answer to two questions about routine \ndelinquencies (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and another question concerning failure to pay federal, state, \nor other taxes, as required, (SOR \u00b6 2.b) were deliberately false. \nApplicant denied both allegations of deliberate falsification. When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An \napplicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining whether a failure \nto disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant asserted in his Answer that he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his \nUSDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but [says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were \nin collections.\u201d I conclude that it is not established that he omitted them deliberately in \nanswer to a question about debts reported to a collection agency. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant indicated in his November 2021 background interview \nthat earlier that month, he had received a letter from the IRS informing him that he owed \n$20,000 in past-due federal income taxes for TY 2019. He volunteered this information in \nhis interview and also asserted that this letter was the first he had heard of this debt. If \nthis is correct, he was not aware of his federal tax debt when he prepared his SCA two \nmonths before, in August 2021. I conclude that deliberate falsification as to SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nnot established. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, either \nhis federal student loans in default or his past-due federal income taxes. He provided \nsufficient evidence to explain or mitigate his lack of candor about his debts on his SCA. \nHe needs to establish that he has addressed, or is addressing, his past-due debts in a \nresponsible way, through evidence of a track record of steady payments and financial \nstability, and he has not yet done so. Since Applicant did not request a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to question him about his debts, or to assess the reasonableness of his \nactions to address them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nthat while personal conduct security concerns are not established, financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m; and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, the financial allegations under Guideline F. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 2.a and 2.b, the falsification allegations under Guideline E. He provided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He graduated from high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but has not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until he was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early 2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to September 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology company. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job. He has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016.

(Item 1) On September \n20, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. DOHA mailed the \nFORM to Applicant on September 22, 2022, and he received it on September 30, 2022. \nHe was afforded 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. On an unspecified subsequent date, he submitted a response (FORM \nResponse), which included exhibits about his taxes (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) T-1 through \nT-8), his student loans (AE A1 through A12), and other debts (AE D1 through D5). I have \nkept the exhibit labeling system Applicant used in his FORM Response. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s exhibits, and Applicant did not \nobject to admission of the Government\u2019s exhibits. \nThe SOR and the Answer (combined as Item 1) are the pleadings in this case. \nItems 2 through 6 are the Government\u2019s exhibits and are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s FORM Response and his exhibits detailed above are all admitted \ninto evidence without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on December 2, 2022. On March 22, 2023, I issued \na decision denying Applicant\u2019s application for access to classified information. Applicant \nappealed, and on May 25, 2023, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case to me for \na new decision. \nEssentially, the Appeal Board agreed with Applicant\u2019s assertion that he had \nsubmitted certain materials to DOHA by fax on or about November 5, 2023, materials that \nshould have been forwarded to Department Counsel and then to me for consideration of \nwhether they should be entered into the record. The Appeal Board remanded the case to \nme to reopen the record to make that determination and then to issue a new decision. \n(Appeal Board Decision) \nOn May 31, 2023, I emailed the parties and requested that Applicant submit to me \nand to Department Counsel the documents he had faxed to DOHA on or about November \n5, 2023, which were the subject of his appeal. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) On June 5, 2023, \nhe did so. These new documents are identified, using Applicant\u2019s labeling system as \nbefore, as a cover document about his student loans (AE SL) and three related \ndocuments (AE SL-1, SL-2, and SL-3). (Department Counsel has indicated that he had \nnot received them previously, in November 2022). Department Counsel did not object to \nadmission of these new documents, and they are therefore admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel offered comments about the new submissions (HE II), and I \ngave Applicant a week to respond. Applicant submitted an e-mail in response, on June \n12, 2023 (AE SL-4) and indicated the next day that he had no supporting documentation \nto provide. AE SL-4 is admitted without objection.

He \nprovided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are \nincorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but \nhas not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until \nhe was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early \n2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to \nSeptember 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology \ncompany. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job. \nHe has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016. (Items 2, 3) \nGuideline F \nThe SOR debts total about $52,000. They include about $30,000 in past-due \nfederal student loans, about $20,000 in past-due federal income taxes, and about $2,000 \nin other past-due debts. The record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs) from June 2022 \nand November 2021 (Items 5, 6), which, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions, establish the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his August 2021 SCA. He \ndiscussed his taxes and other debts during his November 2021 background interview \n(see discussion under Guideline E, below), and he provided updated information in a May \n2022 interrogatory response. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($4,774), 1.b ($4,680), 1.c ($4,429), 1.d ($3,915), 1.e ($3,734), 1.f \n($3,567), 1.g ($2,736), 1.h ($1,617), and 1.j ($587) are Applicant\u2019s past-due federal \nstudent loans, which, as noted, total about $30,000 combined. \nIn his previous submissions, Applicant explained that he attended college between \nages 19 and 24 and needed financial aid in order to do so. To stay qualified for financial \naid, he had to keep his grades up, both in college and while later attending community \ncollege. He failed to do that, so he attempted to work his way through school. He then \nsuccessfully pursued an information technology (IT) certification, and has been with his \nemployer, a government contractor, in his field, ever since. However, he did not earn \nenough to pay expenses and to address his student loan re-payments as well, so he fell \nbehind, and they became delinquent.

Applicant said he applied to rehabilitate his federal student loans by the end of July \n2022. Once approved, he would be required to make 9 or 10 timely consecutive monthly \npayments to achieve loan rehabilitation. (Answer, Item 2) \nApplicant provided relevant documentation with his FORM Response. He was \napproved for an income-based repayment plan of $5 per month. As of October 2022, he \nhad made two $5 payments, in August and September 2022. His loans remained in \n\u201cdefault\u201d status as of October 2022, when they were transferred to another loan servicer. \n(AE A1 \u2013 AE A6) \nThe documents Applicant submitted on remand show that his student loan \naccounts were in good standing as of August 12, 2022, September 24, 2022, and October \n24, 2022. He is to pay $5.00 each month. (AE SL, SL-1, SL-2, and SL-3). AE SL-1 \nprovides details of his nine student loan accounts, and shows that as of August 2022, he \nowed about $27,625 in unpaid principal. There was no interest rate. (AE SL-1) \nIn his June 12 e-mail, Applicant addresses his student loans by noting that they \nare no longer delinquent since he is participating in the loan rehabilitation program. He \nsaid the loans were in forbearance from 2014 to 2016 and became delinquent in 2017 or \n2018. He asserted that the USDOE had an outdated address and phone number for him. \n(AE SL-4) (If so, it was his responsibility to keep them informed of his proper contact \ndetails). He asserts that he addressed the matter once he became aware of it. (AE SL-4) \nOn October 15, 2022, Applicant applied for forgiveness of up to $20,000 of his \nfederal student loans under the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s student debt relief plan. (AE \nA7 \u2013 AE A10). That plan was subsequently challenged in federal court, and as of this \nwriting, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is pending. \nAdditionally, the repayment of several federal student loans have been in \nforbearance status due to the COVID-19 pandemic under multiple Presidential Executive \nOrders since March 2020. The USDOE recently announced that federal student loan \nrepayments will resume in October 2023. https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($700) is an account placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant asserted in his Answer that the account was paid in full and he later provided \ncorroborating documentation. (Item 1; FORM Response; AE D1) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,164) is an account placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denies \nthis debt, and notes that the account was not listed on a July 2022 credit report. That \ncredit report is not in evidence, but the debt is also not listed on a June 2022 credit report \n(Item 5). It is only listed on an earlier credit report, from November 2021.

Applicant admitted the allegation with an explanation. He did not disclose \nany federal income tax debt on his August 2021 SCA, but he reported in his November \n2021 background interview that, in November 2021, he received a letter from the U.S. \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that he owed $20,000 in federal income taxes from \nTY 2019. He said he did not list it on his SCA because he had just found out about it. \n(Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant lives in a state on the U.S. east coast. He indicated in his Answer that \nhis 2019 tax returns were prepared by a tax preparer, Ms. M, in a state in the \nsouthwestern U.S., with a nationally known tax preparation service. The reason why he \nretained an out-of-state tax preparer is not provided. He asserted that he had never owed \ntaxes in the past and owing taxes for TY 2019 was out of character. (Answer, Item 2) \nWith his FORM Response, Applicant provided a series of text messages between \nhimself and Ms. M, apparently from earlier in 2022, in which he repeatedly sought \ninformation on the status of his taxes, noting that his clearance was in jeopardy. (FORM \nResponse; AE T-1 to AE T-7) Ms. M provided a letter (undated, though probably from \n2022), noting that she is her own tax preparation service (in the southwestern state). She \nexplained that Applicant retained her in mid-January 2022 \u201cto settle any clerical errors \nthat involve [Applicant] and his 2019 federal taxes.\u201d She asserted that he first contacted \nher in November 2021 after he received a letter from the IRS. She asserted that he does \nnot owe any taxes and the error resulted from \u201cthe removal of the Earned Income Tax \nCredit\u201d for 2019 due to verification of his employment. She asserted that she expects the \nIRS will soon verify that the problem has been corrected and that Applicant will receive a \nrefund instead of owing past-due taxes. (AE T-8) Ms. M provides no documentation about \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 federal taxes, to include any tax return, correspondence, or \ndocumentation of her interactions with the IRS to resolve the matter. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2022 faxed documents that DOHA did not receive prior to \nthe original decision in this case concerned his student loans and did not concern his \ntaxes or other debts. \nIn his June 12, 2023 e-mail, Applicant explained that he had no new documentary \nevidence about his federal tax debt to provide. He said his tax preparer, Ms. M, told him \nin December 2022 that she was \u201cvery ill\u201d and could provide no more assistance. Applicant \ncontacted the IRS in December 2022 and requested to set up a payment plan.

He has \nsubmitted six-months of paystubs to the IRS to verify his income. He will then submit a \npayment plan for approval. He asserts he has addressed the matter with a sense of \nurgency, and it was his poorly chosen tax preparer who acted in a \u201clackluster\u201d fashion. \n(AE SL-4) Assuming Applicant\u2019s assertion is correct, he owes over $19,000 of his past-\ndue $20,000 past-due federal income tax debt, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) with his May 2022 \ninterrogatory response. He reported net monthly income of just under $3,500 and monthly \nexpenses and debt payments of a combined $3,525, leaving a small negative remainder. \nHe did not list any payments for his SOR debts on his PFS. (Item 4) He provided no \nupdated information about his income, expenses, or debt payments on remand, except \nas noted. \nGuideline E \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. (Item 2) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose that information, in answer to certain questions about his financial \nrecord. Applicant denied the allegations of deliberate falsification. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a concerns the following two questions on Applicant\u2019s August 2021 SCA \nunder: \nSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine \nAccounts: Other than previously listed, have any of the following \nhappened?: \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency\u201d [and] \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. \nAll of the debts Applicant allegedly omitted (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.j-1.l) are debts that \nwere turned over to a collection agency. (Items 5, 6) None of them involved suspended, \ncharged-off, or cancelled accounts. Thus, as to SOR \u00b6 2.a, only the first question above \nis applicable. \nApplicant said he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his USDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but \n[says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were in collections.\u201d He recalled applying for \nrepayment and forbearance. He denied intentional falsification, noting his belief that \u201cthe \nsecurity department\u201d had access to that information \u201cbecause the loans belong to the \nUnited States Federal Government.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b concerns Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose that he had failed to pay \nhis $20,000 in federal taxes from TY 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) As to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant said \nhe was advised by his tax preparer \u201cto not accept fault until it was 100% determined that \nI actually owe.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nIn his background interview, Applicant voluntarily disclosed the November 2021 \nletter he received from the IRS and noted that he had only then learned about his $20,000 \ntax debt for TY 2019. Applicant then denied any other delinquencies, before being \nconfronted with his federal student loans in collection, along with his other past-due debts. \n(Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant did not specifically address the Guideline E allegations further on \nremand, and the related facts above are unchanged from the original decision in this case. \nApplicant closed his June 12 email by asserting that he has held a clearance for \nthe last 10 years without issue or incident, and with no issue about his character or \ntrustworthiness until now. He recognizes that it is privilege to hold a clearance and \nunderstands the values expected of clearance holders. He asserted that every clearance \nholder has made mistakes and can turn it into a lesson learned. He said he did not \nintentionally disregard the rules and expectations of clearance holders. (AE SL-4) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise financial security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant incurred about $30,000 in past-due federal student loans and some other \ndelinquencies. The debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record.

The letter is not in the record, but he disclosed \nthe matter in his November 2021 background interview and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.m, \nconcerning that debt. That admission and disclosure is sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) \nand 19(f) as to SOR \u00b6 1.m. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans are now in rehabilitation, as of October 2022. \nHowever, there is no record evidence that Applicant took steps to address his student \nloans before receiving the SOR. Further, he is under a repayment plan of $5 per month \non a $27,000 debt load. If this plan continues, it will take years to repay the debt. Further, \nApplicant has taken little to no real steps towards addressing or challenging his $20,000 \nfederal tax debt from TY 2019. These debts remain ongoing and unresolved. As such, \nthey continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should \napply. His assertions that his tax preparer has been \u201clackluster\u201d in addressing his tax \nproblems is not enough to show that they did not occur for reasons beyond his control or \nthat he has undertaken good-faith, reasonable efforts to address them. It is too soon to \ntell. Similarly, he has not shown under AG \u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. Applicant has not participated in credit \ncounseling and has not established that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant challenges the IRS\u2019s conclusion that he owes $19,000 in past-due taxes \nfrom TY 2019, but he provided insufficient evidence, such as corroborating \ndocumentation, to support his claim. The uncorroborated opinion of his tax preparer that \nhe will eventually receive a refund is insufficient. Indeed, the fact that the IRS kept his \nrefund from tax year 2022 to address his prior year tax debt refutes this. Applicant also \nchallenges the validity of the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.l and was told that the debt remains valid. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence, particularly documentary evidence, \nto establish that he \u201chas made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. Under Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to disclose that information, in answer to two questions about routine \ndelinquencies (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and another question concerning failure to pay federal, state, \nor other taxes, as required, (SOR \u00b6 2.b) were deliberately false.\n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant denied both allegations of deliberate falsification. When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An \napplicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining whether a failure \nto disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant asserted in his Answer that he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his \nUSDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but [says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were \nin collections.\u201d I conclude that it is not established that he omitted them deliberately in \nanswer to a question about debts reported to a collection agency. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant indicated in his November 2021 background interview \nthat earlier that month, he had received a letter from the IRS informing him that he owed \n$20,000 in past-due federal income taxes for TY 2019. He volunteered this information in \nhis interview and also asserted that this letter was the first he had heard of this debt. If \nthis is correct, he was not aware of his federal tax debt when he prepared his SCA two \nmonths before, in August 2021. I conclude that deliberate falsification as to SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nnot established. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to explain or mitigate his lack of candor \nabout his debts on his SCA. However, his actions to address his student loans and federal \ntax debt is recent and insubstantial. It is therefore insufficient to establish that he has \naddressed, or is addressing, his past-due debts in a responsible way, through evidence \nof a track record of steady payments and financial stability. Since Applicant did not \nrequest a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his debts, or to assess the \nreasonableness of his actions to address them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude that while personal conduct security concerns are not established, \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He married in \n2014 and has two children, ages seven and four. He has worked for his present employer, \na federal contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 17-19, 32) \nApplicant was self-employed from 2007 to 2014 while attending college. He \nworked at various jobs that dealt with the sale of real estate, such as a notary support \nspecialist, a processor, and a mortgage counselor. In July 2014, he decided to become a \nreal estate investor and would purchase property and resell it at a profit. He learned this \nwas a very competitive career, and he was unable to maintain a stable income. He began \nfalling behind on his financial obligations and used credit to help pay his bills. In June \n2016, he decided to become a real estate agent to obtain financial stability. He was \nlicensed in three jurisdictions. He continued to fall behind in his financial obligations. He \nworked part-time jobs to pay his bills. He was unable to live off the income he was earning. \nApplicant testified that while experiencing financial hardship, he reached out to his \ncreditors to resolve his debts, but he was unable to make the payments they proposed. \n(Tr. 22-31; GE 2; Answer to SOR) \nIn 2017, Applicant decided to change careers and go into information technology \n(IT). He worked part-time at a small media company, Apple, and Instacart. He was able \nto continue to work part-time after becoming a full-time employee with his present \nemployer in 2018 but in 2019 he was no longer able to maintain his part-time jobs due to \nthe demands of his full-time work schedule. (Tr. 18-30) \nApplicant testified that his wife worked temporary jobs for a period but did not work \nfor periods when she was pregnant and after their children were born. She presently \nworks for a company as a temporary employee and anticipates being hired in a permanent \nposition, which would increase her income. (Tr. 18-21, 28-29) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background investigation with a government investigator in \nJanuary 2022, he stated that in May 2019 he hired a credit repair company and some of \nhis debts were removed, and Applicant did not have any further obligation toward them. \nHe also said some were charged-off and he had no further obligation to the creditor. He \ntestified that he also received some financial counseling from the credit repair company. \n(Tr. 55-57; GE 2) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that he and his wife reduced their spending and moved so they \nwould pay less for rent but are still living paycheck to paycheck. His goal is to complete \ncertifications in his field that will allow him to advance in his career and potentially increase \nhis income. He hopes that once his income increases, he will be able to address his \ndelinquent debts. He acknowledges that he is responsible for the debts and wants to \nrepay them. He said he would need to double his current income to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. 27-31, 41-49 \nApplicant testified that he continues to struggle financially and often at the end of \nthe month he does not have sufficient income to pay all of his bills. He and his wife share \na vehicle. His mother-in-law provides day care for the children. They have no savings. \n(Tr. 30-31) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts. During Applicant\u2019s interview with a \ngovernment investigator in January 2022, he explained the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($17,723) \nand 1.d ($5,590) are lines of credit with the same creditor. He was unable to negotiate a \nsettlement with the creditor. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($9,870), 1.c ($5,603) and 1.e \n($9,371) are credit-card accounts. Applicant testified that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a \ncharged-off student loan ($25,000). He told the investigator he believed that he was no \nlonger responsible for it as it had been removed from his credit report and charged-off. At \nhis hearing, he acknowledged it was likely held by a third-party collector. Applicant \ntestified that none of these SOR delinquent debts are resolved or paid. He said he intends \nto repay them when he is able. (Tr. 41, 45, 51; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s current annual income was approximately $60,000 in 2018 and has \nincrementally increased to approximately $72,000 for this year. He earns about $3,000 to \n$5,000 from part-time jobs. His wife began working full-time three months ago and earns \nabout $30,000 annually. They have no investments, except his pension to which he \ncontributes. They live within their means and have no new debts. Applicant owes \napproximately $87,000 for student loans that are deferred. His wife owes approximately \n$30,000 for student loans that are deferred. They have applied for income-based \nrepayment plans. (Tr. 18-21, 34-40, 49-55) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has approximately $73,157 in delinquent debt that he is unable to pay. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in about 2016 when he decided \nto become an entrepreneur in the real estate market, first buying and selling real estate \nand then as an agent. He was unable to keep up with his financial obligations and used \nlines of credit and credit cards that he was unable to repay. He has not paid, resolved, or \nsettled any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His debts are recent and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant chose to enter the real estate business attempting to make a profit \nbuying and selling property and then as a real estate agent. He was unsuccessful but it \nwas a personal choice he made to participate in a highly competitive career. This was \nwithin his control. He used credit cards and lines of credit when he was unable to meet \nhis financial obligations. This was also within his control. Applicant is unable to pay his \ncreditors. Although he testified that he intends to repay his creditors in the future when he \nis able, he does not have a realistic plan at this point. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant stated he received some financial counseling from the credit repair company \nwith whom he worked. However, there are no clear indications that his financial problems \nare being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 30, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (DODCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant her security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAS took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn October 31, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of the \nallegations, except SOR subparagraph 3.d, and requested a decision on the written \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord instead of a hearing.  On November 30, 2022, the Government prepared a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of a brief, together with six attachments (Items 1 \u2013 \n6) in support of its position. Applicant received a copy of the FORM on December 1, 2022, \nand was given 30 days to file a response. Applicant did not file a response, and on \nJanuary 30, 2023, the case was assigned to me. On May 12, 2023, I re-opened the record \nsua sponte, extending it through May 30, 2023, to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit exhibits. Applicant did not submit any exhibits, whereupon, I closed the record on \nMay 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old, single woman with two children, ages 14 and 6. She is \na high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Item 2 at 10) She has been \nworking for a federal government contractor as a security alarms dispatcher since 2021 \n(Item 2 at 12). \nOver the years, Applicant incurred approximately $58,000 of delinquent debt. \n(Answer at 5) Approximately $54,000 consists of student loan debt, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, a credit card account, as alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and a \nmedical bill, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d. Applicant attributes her difficulty with keeping \nup with her debts to the difficulties of making ends meet as a single mother of two children. \n(Item 2 at 4) The credit account alleged in subparagraph 1.c, totaling, $1,921, was \nopened, unbeknownst to her, by her ex-boyfriend, an authorized card user, and she \nincurred the medical bill, alleged in subparagraph 1.d, totaling $1,333, after a car \naccident. \nApplicant contends that she applied for a student loan debt relief plan that will \nforgive $20,000 of the debt, and she promised to set up a payment plan to satisfy the \nremainder once the $20,000 was forgiven. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant provided no proof of a \nloan forgiveness application, nor did she provide proof that part of her student loan debt \nhas been forgiven, or that she has arranged a payment plan. \nApplicant closed the account alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and contends that she \nwill pay the balance once she receives an insurance settlement from an automobile \naccident in which she was involved. (Item 1 at 4) Similarly, Applicant contends that she \nwill satisfy the medical bill, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d, after she receives the \nsettlement. \nIn September 2008, while at home breastfeeding her newborn child, Applicant\u2019s \nthen boyfriend began to beat her. Attempting to escape his abuse, Applicant ran to her \nkitchen. Her then boyfriend chased her into the kitchen and did not stop attempting to \nbeat her until she grabbed a kitchen knife and cut him. (Item 1 at 4) Subsequently, he \ncontacted the police, who arrested Applicant the next day, and charged her with \npossessing an instrument of a crime, simple assault, aggravated assault, reckless \nendangering, terroristic threats, harassment, and attempted criminal homicide.

(Item 6 \nat 7) Applicant no longer has contact with her ex-boyfriend. (Item 6 at 7) \nOne morning before going to work, Applicant\u2019s mother, who typically took care of \nApplicant\u2019s child while she was at work, called and told her that she was running late. \nAfraid to be late to work, Applicant contacted a neighbor who agreed to watch the child \nuntil Applicant\u2019s mother arrived. Applicant then left for work and told the neighbor to enter \nthe home through the unlocked back door. \nThe neighbor did not come to the home immediately, as promised. (Item 1 at 4) \nWhile no caregivers were present, Applicant\u2019s child, then eight years old, attempted to \ncook food, and started a fire. Ultimately, the child exited the house without being harmed, \nand his grandmother arrived before the fire could spread. Applicant, however, was \ncharged with endangering the welfare of a child, and recklessly endangering another \nperson. After completing 40 hours of court-ordered volunteer work, the charges were \ndismissed. (Item 4 at 4) \nIn the fall of 2020, Applicant enrolled her son in a private school. (Item 1 at 4) \nFrustrated with the harder schoolwork and the transfer, in general, Applicant\u2019s son \nbecame rebellious, frequently misbehaving in school and not performing his assigned \ntasks. Applicant disciplined him by periodically taking away his video games, his cell \nphone, his laptop computer, and his extracurricular activities. (Item 1 at 5) In June 2020, \nafter the principal notified Applicant that he was going to expel her son, Applicant whipped \nher son five to six times with a switch. (Item 4 at 11) \nThe next day, Applicant told a classmate, who then told a school administrator. \nSubsequently, child protective services initiated an investigation and discovered welts on \nApplicant\u2019s child\u2019s legs that were indicative of the type of beating that he described to his \nclassmate. Subsequently, in July 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npossessing an instrument of a crime, simple assault, aggravated assault, and \nendangering the welfare of a child. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant voluntarily began parenting \nclasses. Later, she pleaded guilty to simple assault, and agreed to continue the parenting \nclasses and attend therapy, as part of probation. (1 at 5) After she completed these steps, \nthe child protective services case was closed and the criminal case was dismissed. (Item \n1 at 11) \nIn December 2015, Applicant was fired from her job for bringing her child to work, \nas alleged in subparagraph 3.b. (Item 1 at 6) In April 2017, and later in September 2019, \nApplicant was fired from her employment for repeated tardiness, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 3.c and 3.d, respectively. (Item 1 at 6) Applicant\u2019s problems with job \nstability resulted from difficulties balancing her work schedule and care for her children, \nas a single parent. Specifically, she could not afford professional daycare and was \ndependent on friends and family to watch her children. If they were late to her home to \npick up her children, she was late to work, or in the situation alleged in subparagraph 3.b, \nif a child-care provider cancelled at the last minute, she had to take her child to work. \n(Item 1 at 12) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to repeated tardiness, Applicant\u2019s employer, as referenced in \nsubparagraph 3.d, fired her for job abandonment. Applicant denied that she abandoned \nthe job and contended that she stopped coming to work after being injured in a car \naccident. Despite successfully applying for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, \nher employer construed her failure to come to work as job abandonment, and denied her \nrequest for unemployment benefits. Applicant appealed this decision, and the \nunemployment commission ruled in her favor, and concluded that her failure to come to \nwork did not constitute job abandonment. (Item 1 at 12) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to difficulties making ends meet as a single \nmother of two children. Moreover, she incurred one of the debts after her then boyfriend \nused her credit card without her knowledge. Conversely, Applicant did not provide \nsubstantiating evidence for any steps that she was taking to satisfy or otherwise resolve \nher debts. Under these circumstances, the surrounding circumstances which contributed \nto her financial problems trigger the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201c the conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft) . . . \u201c  but \nher failure to detail how she acted responsibly under the circumstances, renders the \nsecond prong inapplicable. Similarly, absent any evidence supporting her claim that \napproximately half of her student loan debt will be forgiven, or any evidence of financial \ncounseling, none of the remaining mitigating conditions are applicable. I conclude that \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) \nApplicant\u2019s domestic violence charges stemming from the altercation with her ex-\nboyfriend in 2008, the 2016 child endangerment charge, and the 2021 child abuse charge, \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally prosecuted charged, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 potentially apply: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s charge for assaulting her ex-boyfriend stemmed from an episode that \noccurred 15 years ago. Moreover, Applicant did not cut her ex-boyfriend until after he \nrepeatedly beat her, and until after she tried to run away from him to no avail. The court \nsubsequently dismissed the charges against her.  AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2016 charge related to leaving her child alone in the home occurred \nfrom unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, as she made child care plans with \nher mother before leaving the home, then, when her mother informed her she was running \nlate, made child care plans with a neighbor who failed to follow through on a promise to \nwatch her child until her mother arrived. The court dismissed the charges after Applicant \ncompleted volunteer work. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(b) apply. \nThe criminal charges stemming from Applicant\u2019s corporal punishment of her child \nare recent, as the episode did not occur until two months before the issuance of the SOR. \nNevertheless, Applicant, with the assistance of child protective services, successfully \ncompleted the probation requirements, completing parenting classes and therapy, \nleading to the closure of the case. AG \u00b6 32(b) applies, and AG \u00b6 32 (a) is partially \napplicable, in that the behavior does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \nreliability, or good judgment. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe conduct alleged in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c is cross-alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 3.a, and is mitigated for the same reasons, as discussed above. SOR \nsubparagraphs 3.b and 3.c are involve issues of childcare concerns, not security \nconcerns. As such, AG \u00b6 15 does not apply. When Applicant applied for unemployment \nbenefits after her termination from her job in March 2020, the unemployment benefits \ncommission concluded that she did not abandon the job, as alleged by the employer. In \naddition, the repeated tardiness was indicative of childcare problems, rather than issues \nof security concern. I conclude that AG \u00b6 15 does not apply. In sum, I resolve the \nallegations set forth in SOR subparagraphs 3.a through 3.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;(5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant never provided any documents substantiating her contention that \nher debts would either be forgiven or paid through an insurance settlement.

He admitted \nthe SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the \ncase to me on December 1, 2022. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 13, \n2022, setting the hearing for January 26, 2023. On that date, Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. Applicant testified, but offered no \ndocumentary evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s \nrequest to leave the record open until February 15, 2023. for submission of documentary \nevidence in mitigation. Applicant timely submitted a statement of intent and five character-\nreference letters, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B and admitted without \nobjection from Department Counsel. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nFebruary 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old. He recently married, for the first time, and has no \nchildren. He earned a high school diploma in June 2005 and a Computer Support \nTechnician Certificate from a technical college in May 2015. He began his current \nemployment as a computer network support technician with a major defense contractor \nin August 2014, and has held a security clearance since 2018 in connection with that \nwork. He never served in the military or held a Federal civil service position. (GE 1; Tr. 7-\n8, 25-28.) \nOn May 24, 2018, Applicant submitted his initial Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance that he needed to \nmove into a position involving access to classified information. As alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, \nhe responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question in Section 23 asking, \u201cIn the last seven (7) years, \nhave you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled \nsubstance includes injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or \notherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance.\u201d He was granted a final Secret \nclearance by the DoD CAF in August 2018. (GE 1; GE 4, Tr. 27-30.) \nIn early 2021 Applicant decided to improve his potential employment opportunities \nby applying for a part-time second job with a government agency (GA). The job required \na Top Secret clearance. He was not asked to submit another e-QIP, but underwent an \nenhanced background investigation. During his initial interview during May 2021, he told \nthe GA investigator that he had not used illegal drugs, including marijuana. He was then \nscheduled to take a July 2021 polygraph test. During the pre-polygraph interview on the \ntest date, he admitted that he had smoked marijuana. The details of the investigation by \nthe GA were not entered into this record. However, Applicant confirmed that he first \ndisclosed his previous use of marijuana to security officials during that July 2021 \ninterview. Due to the resulting security concerns, the GA denied him a clearance and did \nnot hire him.

That security \nofficer directed him to complete another e-QIP, in which he wrote that he had used \nmarijuana between April 2004 and May 2021 in the form of THC candy consumption or \nsmoking. He said this was \u201cvery very infrequent\u201d and occurred a total of approximately 20 \ntimes. This information was forwarded to the DoD CAF, for its consideration whether his \nDoD Secret clearance should be revoked. During an interview with an investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on March 28, 2022, he reiterated that he \nsmoked marijuana approximately 20 times during the reported dates, but said that he had \ndifficulty providing an accurate approximation. He said that he never purchased \nmarijuana, but used it \u201cat parties and sometimes after work,\u201d and that he had not sought \nprofessional counseling or treatment for marijuana use. His testimony during the hearing \nwas broadly consistent with these assertions. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 31-34.) \nApplicant testified that his most recent period of marijuana use occurred during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, when he started a second job moonlighting in a bar and restaurant. \nHe worked there from October 2020 until May 2021. He said he and friends from that \nemployment would go out after the bar closed to share marijuana at parties. His \ndescription of this activity portrayed a regular pattern during this seven-month period. He \nclaimed that these marijuana parties took place on days when the bar closed earlier in \nthe evening, rather than on the nights when it closed in the early morning hours. However, \nhe also said that he did participate when he had to work the next morning at his weekday \njob with the defense contractor. It is unusual that the bar where he worked would have \nclosed early on Friday and Saturday nights, but after midnight on Sundays through \nThursdays preceding his workdays. Those incongruent assertions raise significant \ncredibility issues, as do his repeated and vague minimizations in describing his drug-use \nhistory while holding and seeking to upgrade his security clearance. (Tr. 35-40, 45-47.) \nIn his 2021 e-QIP, Applicant said that he was \u201cin search for a drug awareness \nclass.\u201d In response to DOHA interrogatories he said, \u201cI have research [sic] some drug \nimprovement class, but was unaware which one would fit the [GA] criteria.\u201d During his \nhearing testimony he said that he had not attended any such programs. He described his \ncontinuing use of marijuana until May 2021 as, \u201ca bad choice in judgement,\u201d \u201ca bad \nchoice,\u201d and \u201ca lapse in judgement.\u201d He further stated that he is, \u201ccommitted to not taken \n[sic] any more substance,\u201d and \u201cthere will be no further use after incident.\u201d He no longer \nparties with his former coworkers from the bar. The record contains no evaluation from a \ndoctor or other medical professional assessing the level of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse, or \nexpressing a prognosis for future abstinence. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 38, 45.) \nApplicant testified that, while applying for his initial security clearance with the \ndefense contractor, he intentionally falsified his 2018 e-QIP because he knew that an \nhonest disclosure of his recent marijuana use would reduce his chances to obtain the job \nand a security clearance. He also testified that he knew his marijuana use was illegal at \nthe time. As noted above, he initially attempted to deceive the GA investigators \nconcerning his ongoing marijuana use again in 2021, but admitted it when he was \nconfronted with taking a polygraph examination.

His manager wrote that he always \nworks hard, operates in an ethical manner, performs at a very high level, and has a \nsupportive loving family. Applicant\u2019s wife describes him as \u201ca reliable, trustworthy, \nstraightforward, honest man.\u201d She said he has \u201calways abided by the protocols and \nprocedures of his work, taking classification seriously, never sharing private information, \nand always stepping in to help his coworkers.\u201d She said, \u201cHis integrity is extremely \nimportant to him and others recognize him for it.\u201d (AE B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations, each guideline lists potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, pertinent, and reliable information about \nthe person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of protected information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concerns under the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying based on the SOR allegations in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admittedly used marijuana with varying frequency from April 2004 to May \n2021. His use included multiple occasions after August 2018 when he was granted \nnational security eligibility and began working with classified information.

She reaffirmed the 2014 SecEA memorandum \nregarding the importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of \nmarijuana by holders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal \nmarijuana policy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance \nadjudications, \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines \nprovided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns \nraised by his or her past use of marijuana. \nViewed in the context of the whole person, Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by marijuana use from his junior year of high school though May 2021, \nwhen he was confronted with a pending polygraph examination likely to reveal his \npersistent false denials of this drug abuse some three years after his initial clearance. He \nknew that his drug involvement was both illegal and contrary to security policies, yet it \ncontinued due to his admitted bad choices and lapses in judgment. He claims to have no \nintention to use in the future, and to have stopped associating with his friends in the places \nwhere they used drugs. However, only his self-serving statements support these \nassertions, which were not addressed by the friends and family members who wrote \nletters on his behalf. His admitted long history of drug abuse ended only two years ago, \nand only when he was faced with a polygraph examination. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThis evidence does not establish that drug abuse is unlikely to recur, and it casts \ncontinuing doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nSubstantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) was not established. Other potential \nmitigating conditions are inapplicable in the absence of prescription drug abuse or any \nevidence of drug treatment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under the facts alleged in the SOR: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant deliberately falsified his 2018 e-QIP concerning his use of marijuana with \nvarying frequency since 2004, because he knew it to have been illegal and detrimental to \nobtaining his national security eligibility. He admits that he intended to conceal this \ninformation. He also attempted to conceal his continuing drug abuse after obtaining a \nclearance when he applied to the GA in 2021, because he admittedly knew that it would \nnegatively affect his personal and professional standing. The record evidence clearly \nestablishes \u201cspecial interest\u201d security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(a), and 16(e). \nAG \u00b6 17 includes three conditions that could mitigate the security concern arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant provided insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions. He finally admitted the falsification in 2021 when confronted with the \nGA polygraph examination, but this was neither a prompt nor a good faith effort to correct \nthe concealment that he had attempted to continue earlier that year. He only confessed \nto his company FSO after the GA denial of his clearance became a matter of record, \nwhich was not the type of \u201cpositive step\u201d that would demonstrate trustworthiness or \nsignificantly reduce vulnerability. Applicant\u2019s falsification and concealment were not minor \noffenses. They occurred over a recent three-year period, and under circumstances that \nwere not unique. He engaged in purposeful deception concerning information that he \nknew to have security significance, in order to pursue what he perceived to be his self-\ninterest. His conduct casts continuing doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nintentionally attempted to conceal his past drug abuse, failing to demonstrate either \nrehabilitation or accountability for his misuse of marijuana before and during the time he \nwas granted a security clearance. He failed to convincingly demonstrate his intention to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabstain from further substance misuse. He provided insufficient evidence of his \ntrustworthiness, responsibility, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. The \npotential for pressure, exploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Recurrence of \nsubstance misuse is not unlikely given his history. \nOverall, the evidence creates significant doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and the Personal \nConduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDAVID M. WHITE \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He stated that his \ncontentious divorce from his first wife, which encompassed the years 2014-2016, caused \nhim great financial strain resulting in these delinquencies. These debts were not resolved \nby Appellant. (Tr. 17, 21; GE 2, 6-9; AE A; SOR Answer) \nApplicant testified that his current finances are in good shape. He stated he has \nno new delinquencies. His July 2023 credit report shows one collection account for $456, \nwhich had a date of last activity in September 2016 (this debt was not alleged in the SOR \nand will not be considered for disqualification purposes, but it may be considered for \ncredibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-person factors). Appellant\u2019s and his \ncurrent wife\u2019s monthly take-home pay total approximately $14,600. He did not give an \nestimate of his monthly expenses during his testimony. During his background interview, \nhe told the investigator that he had approximately $6,500 left over at the end of the month \nwhich he would use to begin paying his delinquent debts. He presented no evidence that \nhe has done this. (Tr. 18, 21, 26; GE 2) \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant admitted to the conduct for which he was tried and convicted at an Army \nSpecial Court-Martial in July 2019. Applicant was the staff noncommissioned officer in \ncharge (NCOIC) of a college ROTC detachment. In that role, he had access to and control \nover the unit\u2019s funds and accounts generated through fund raising. At the time, he was \ngeographically separated from his first wife and three children, who lived in a different \nstate (State A). His wife filed for divorce and Applicant was required to travel to State A \nfor the divorce proceedings and to see his daughters. He did not have the personal funds \nto do this, so he decided to take money from the ROTC accounts. A subsequent Army \ninvestigation determined that he deposited 33 checks from three ROTC accounts into his \npersonal account from about 2013 to 2017. When questioned by investigators, he claimed \nhe had no knowledge of the missing ROTC funds and denied any wrongdoing.

He was sentenced as indicated above. He fully paid \nrestitution in the amount of $9,050 within the time allowed. He testified that he understood \nthat his actions were a breach of his integrity and the trust reposed in him based upon his \nmilitary status. (Tr. 22-24; AE A) \nAppellant testified that he has had no further employment misconduct since this \nincident, nor has he had any subsequent arrests by law enforcement. His record shows \nthat in 1994, when he was a private second-class, he was apprehended for shoplifting \nfrom an Army and Air Force Exchange facility. His exchange privilege card was \nconfiscated, and he was turned over to his unit. No further information was included (this \nallegation was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for disqualification \npurposes, but it may be considered for credibility, mitigation, and in applying the whole-\nperson factors).

(AE B-D) \nApplicant testified that he teaches firearms safety as an additional job. He also \nqualified for a Federal Firearms License (FFL), which he claimed required an FBI \nbackground check. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant received a Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnosis in 2014. \nHis PTSD is related to events that transpired during his combat deployments. (Tr. 25) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred four delinquent debts. Although facing financial stress due to a \npending divorce, he did nothing to address the debts. At one time he was financially \nunable to pay these debts. More recently he had the ability to pay them, yet he chose not \nto do so. I find that all of the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing, and he has not made any \npayments toward them. His inaction towards resolving his debts casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s divorce was a condition beyond his control. However, his decision to \nnot pay his debts was a choice he made. Additionally, he did not act responsibly \nconcerning his debts when he decided to allow them to fall off his credit report due to age. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. Apparently, his plan to \ndeal with his debts was to do nothing and to let them fall off his credit report. While this \nmay be an appropriate option to take viewed through a financial prism, it does not equate \nto acting responsibly and in good faith, and it puts into question his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b616 and the following potentially apply: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources. \nApplicant was the senior NCOIC who was entrusted with ROTC funds. He violated \nthat trust, over a period of years, by taking funds on multiple occasions from the unit \naccounts. He stole over $9,000 of ROTC funds to pay for his personal trips to State A. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is \nsufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, \nthe general concerns about questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and a pattern of \ndishonesty contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16(c), and 16(d) are established. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nStealing over $9,000 from ROTC funds is not a minor offense. His theft is \naggravated by the fact that he was in a senior leadership position and breached the trust \nthat was placed in him. He also was not forthcoming when he was initially questioned \nabout this incident. Additionally, while remote, he has a history of dishonest conduct going \nback to his apprehension for shoplifting as a young soldier. There was no evidence of \ncounseling. The stressors caused by his divorce may now be over, but that is insufficient \nto overcome the doubt cast on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment by his past \nlarceny and breaches of trust. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, VA disability, and favorable character \nevidence. However, I also considered that he did not attempt to pay his debts or take any \nother action to resolve his delinquent debts. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, and his plan to let his debts fall off his credit report causes \nme to question his reliability and willingness to resolve his debts in the future. His theft of \nROTC funds for which he was responsible in order to affect personal gain also causes \nme to question his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations or personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2021, despite being \nrequired to do so. It also alleged that he failed to timely file his state income tax returns \nfor the same tax years, as well as for the 2020 tax year. Finally, it alleged that he was \nindebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for delinquent federal taxes in the \namount of $5,797 for tax year 2020. In the Answer, Applicant admitted all the SOR \nallegations with additional comments. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. The SOR allegations are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \nexhibits included with the FORM. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant filed his late 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 federal income tax returns \nwith the IRS in July 2021. He also filed his late 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 state \nincome tax returns in July 2021. He filed these income tax returns after he submitted his \nMay 2021 Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86). He provided \ndocumentary corroboration of these filings in the form of signed and unsigned copies of \nhis relevant income tax returns. Most of the income tax returns were prepared by a \nprofessional tax preparer. He claimed that he filed his late federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax year 2021, without providing corroborating evidence. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that he resolved his delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2020. \nA November 2022 letter from the IRS shows that a portion of his 2018 tax year refund \nwas applied to his 2020 tax delinquency, reducing his 2018 refund to $9.52. The IRS \nwould not have provided this refund if he still owed delinquent taxes for tax year 2020. \nTherefore, I find that he resolved his 2020 tax year delinquency in November 2022. \n(Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that he did not timely file the aforementioned income tax \nreturns because he was depressed after separating from his wife, because of laziness, \nand because of the COVID-19 pandemic. His granddaughter passed away in 2021, and \nhe claimed that her death caused him to miss the deadline for filing his 2020 state \nincome tax returns. He claimed that he will comply with his income tax return filings in \nthe future. In April 2022, he submitted a personal financial statement showing that he \nhas a surplus of about $375 after his expenses are paid at the end of each month. \n(Items 2-4, 8; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2016 through \n2019 and 2021 tax years. He failed to timely file his state income tax returns for the \n2016 through 2021 tax years. He owed the IRS delinquent federal taxes for the 2020 tax \nyear. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhile Applicant has now filed most of his late federal and state income tax \nreturns, he has not provided documentary evidence that he filed his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2021. It is reasonable to expect him to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of his claimed income tax filings. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Therefore, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he has remedied his failure to file his income tax returns. \nFor the relevant income tax returns Applicant has filed, he did so only after \nbeginning the clearance process. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns \nonly after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack \nthe judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). This timing cuts against his efforts to show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or in good faith. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply to his \nfailure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and those allegations are \nnot mitigated. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2020, as he has \nprovided sufficient evidence that he has resolved those taxes, I find that AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies. He has mitigated the SOR allegations concerning his delinquent 2020 taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying\nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\n \n \nApplicant accrued delinquent consumer debts during a period of unemployment \nafter leaving military service. The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He has been employed since January 2021. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge to \ndeliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under Mitigating \nCondition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). His recent actions to resolve \ntwo debts only after receiving the FORM does not receive this mitigating credit. See ISCR \nCase No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish that he has made \na good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant attributes his debts to a period of unemployment and underemployment \nafter leaving the military. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For full \nconsideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. He completed his SCA in \nFebruary 2021. The most recent record evidence (April 2022 credit report) shows all the \ndebts remained past due. He addressed two debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, approximately \none week after he received the FORM. An applicant who waits until his clearance is in \njeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with \naccess to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) \nciting ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2017). Even though Applicant\u2019s \ndebts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his control, he did not provide \nsufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve them. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is detailed in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe following is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nApplicant incurred alcohol-related arrests in 2006 and 2019. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 22(c) also applies, as the record evidence of the two alcohol-related arrests supports \na finding that Applicant engaged in recent, habitual consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 DUI arrest did not deter his behavior, as he incurred another DWI \nin 2019. He acknowledges the maladaptive effect alcohol has had on his life and states \nhe now abstains from alcohol. He asserts that he has fulfilled all his legal obligations for \nhis 2019 DUI conviction and that he also completed the military\u2019s SARP, but he has not \nsubmitted documentary evidence to corroborate his claims. He has submitted no \nevidence that he is participating in an ongoing counseling or treatment program or that \nhe is making satisfactory progress in any treatment program. While he declares he now \nabstains from alcohol and has no intentions of drinking in the future, Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to establish that the security concern regarding his history of \nproblematic alcohol involvement is mitigated. None of the above mitigating conditions fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and G in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s financial \ndelinquencies are largely attributable to circumstances beyond his control, they remain \nlargely unresolved. He was arrested for DUI in 2006 and was arrested and convicted of \nDWI in 2019. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F and G and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his delinquent debts and his alcohol-related conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b and 1.e-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-b: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations of drug involvement in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. He stated that he \u201ctechnically\u201d admitted the allegation of falsification in SOR \u00b6 2.a, but he denied intending to deceive. I have treated his answer to SOR \u00b6 2.a as a denial. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old information technology technician employed by a defense contractor since June 2021.

Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on November 8, 2022. On November 9, 2022, a complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s \nevidence. The FORM consists of five items. FORM Items 1 and 2 are the pleadings in \nthe case, and FORM Items 3-5 are the Government\u2019s evidence, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant received the FORM on December 2, 2022, and he \nresponded with an undated three-page statement, which was marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A and admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 23, 2022. \nEvidentiary Issue \nThe FORM Item 3 is a summary of an enhanced subject interview (ESI) \nconducted on February 1, 2022. The summary was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions, \nor updates; or to object to consideration of the summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. Applicant submitted a detailed response to the FORM but did not \ncomment on the accuracy or completeness of the summary, nor did he object to it. I \nconclude that he waived any objections to FORM Item 3.

While walking between bars, the group was confronted by two loud, \nobnoxious, and aggressive men, resulting in an affray that was stopped by nearby \npolice officers. All the participants were handcuffed and transported to the police station. \nWhen Applicant was searched by the police, they found a small quantity of cocaine in a \nplastic bag in his pocket. He was charged with participating in an affray, a \nmisdemeanor, and felony possession of a Schedule II controlled substance. \nIn May 2021, with the assistance of an attorney and pursuant to a plea \nagreement, Applicant pleaded guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia. The charges \nof participating in an affray and the felony drug charges were dismissed. He was \nrequired to complete a 16-hour program of drug classes, and he was placed on \nunsupervised probation for one year. (FORM Item 3 at 50-51; FORM Item 5 at 6) During \nthe ESI in February 2022, Applicant admitted that he had used cocaine in college as \nwell as on the night of the affray. (FORM Item 5 at 5.) \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in December 2021, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to a \nquestion in Section 22\u2014Police Record, asking whether, in the last seven years, he had \nbeen or was currently on probation or parole. He disclosed an arrest in April 2014 for \ndriving under the influence (DUI), his conviction in August 2015, and a sentence that \nincluded one year of unsupervised probation. He also disclosed his arrest in May 2021 \nfor the drug offense and participating in an affray, his conviction of possessing \nparaphernalia, and his sentence that included probation for one year. \nHowever, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to two questions in Section 23\u2014Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Drug Activity. The first question asked if, in the last seven years, he had \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances, and the second question asked if he \nhad ever illegally used or had otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled \nsubstance while possessing a security clearance other than previously listed. His \nanswers to the questions in Section 23 are the basis for the allegation that he falsified \nhis SCA. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that when he completed his \nSCA, it contained the answers from previous SCAs, and he updated the portion asking \nabout arrests but skimmed through the section asking about use of drugs. He stated \nthat during the ESI, the investigator went through each section of the SCA, and when \nthey reached the section on drug use, he told the investigator that the subject was \naddressed in the section involving arrests. He told the investigator that there were \nmultiple sections in the SCA with similar questions, and he thought that providing the \ninformation in one section was sufficient.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15\u00ad\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifications under this guideline; \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \nAG \u00b6 26(d): satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment \nprogram, including, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare \nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine in college is not \nrecent, but his use of cocaine at the birthday celebration in March 2021 is recent, and it \nreflects a continuation of his college-age attitude toward illegal drug use.  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant completed the drug-education \nprogram that was a condition of the probation imposed after his most recent conviction. \nHowever, he continues to associate with some of the same college friends who used \ncocaine in March 2021, and he has not provided the statement of intent in AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3). \nAG \u00b6 26(d) is not established. Applicant completed an drug education program, \nbut he has not completed a \u201cprescribed drug treatment program\u201d that includes \nrehabilitation and aftercare requirements, and he has not provided a \u201cfavorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA by answering \u201cno\u201d to the \nquestions asking if he had, in the last seven years, illegally used any drugs or controlled \nsubstances and asking if had ever illegally used or been illegally involved with a drug or \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance, other than previously listed. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his negative answers in Section 23 after disclosing his \ndrug use while holding a security clearance in Section 22 is plausible and credible. He \nwas careless, but not intentionally deceptive. His full disclosure of his drug-related \nconduct in Section 22 is sufficient to refute the allegation that he was attempting to \nconceal it in Section 23. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. No other disqualifying conditions \nunder Guideline E are alleged. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).

His request for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 28, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation as part of his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the results \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine, as required by \nExecutive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), that it \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access \nto classified information. \nOn September 6, 2022, the DOD CAF sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse). This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on November 1, 2022. The FORM proffered five exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 5) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. Applicant \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits or to \nprovide other additional information. He did not respond to the FORM, and he did not file \nany objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits within the allotted time. Accordingly, GX 1 \u2013 \n5 became part of the record, which closed on December 1, 2022. I received the case for \ndecision on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that between June 2017 and May 2018, \nApplicant used marijuana approximately 300 times while he had access to classified \ninformation (SOR 1.a); and that during the same period, he purchased marijuana with \nvarying frequency while he had access to classified information (SOR 1.b). He admitted \nwithout comment both allegations. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on my review of the information \npresented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked since August 2011. He and his wife have been married since July 2010 and they \nhave three children. He was first granted a security clearance in September 2011. \n(FORM, Items 3 and 5) \nApplicant first used marijuana in high school and college between September 1997 \nand May 2004. During this period, he smoked marijuana as often as daily, and at least \nweekly, purchasing the drug from people he knew, including his brother. He stopped in \n2004 because he felt he no longer needed it. He also did not want to spend money buying \nmarijuana when he also had to pay for his college education. (FORM, Item 4) \nIn 2017, marijuana became legal in the state where Applicant lives. He decided to \nstart using it again because it was legal under state law and because he felt it may help \nwith his anxiety. During a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator \non November 22, 2021, he estimated that he used marijuana about 300 times between \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJune 2017 and May 2018. He knew at that time that his use of marijuana, while having a \nsecurity clearance, was \u201cforbidden\u201d and could disqualify him from access to sensitive \ninformation. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nIn May 2018, Applicant checked himself into a hospital for treatment of severe \nanxiety, depression, and related behavioral problems. He believes his extensive use of \nmarijuana over the previous year had altered his brain chemistry and caused him to \nbehave erratically towards his wife. Applicant no longer experiences the behavioral issues \nthat he believes were caused or exacerbated by his marijuana use. He has not used \nmarijuana or any other illegal substance since May 2018. (FORM, Item 4) \nThe summary of his PSI reported that Applicant did not disclose his drug use to \nhis employer\u2019s security office; however, in response to DOHA interrogatories, he averred \nthat after he was hospitalized in 2018, he was asked to submit \u201ca preemptive SF 86\u201d in \nwhich he disclosed his drug use while cleared. He also reported his drug use in his \nSeptember 2021 e-QIP. (FORM, Item 4) \nApplicant no longer associates with the people with whom he used marijuana. In \nhis e-QIP, in his PSI, and in his notarized response to interrogatories, he stated his \nintention to abstain from any future use of marijuana. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013, which was updated by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in \nDecember 2021, makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his \nstate of residence, was illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by \ncivilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nApplicant illegally purchased, possessed, and used marijuana in high school and \ncollege between 1997 and 2004. As alleged in the SOR, he purchased and used \nmarijuana in 2017 and 2018 while also having access to classified information. Despite \nthe legalization of marijuana at the state level in 2017, his conduct in this regard remained \nillegal under federal law and was incompatible with his eligibility to access classified \ninformation through his employment as a federal contractor. This information reasonably \nraises the security concern about drug involvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nBy contrast, I have considered the potential applicability of the pertinent mitigating \nconditions presented under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. By contrast, it has been nearly five years \nsince Applicant last used marijuana. He no longer associates with persons who use illegal \ndrugs, and he has clearly expressed his intent to abstain from using marijuana in the future. \nThis information supports application of the cited mitigating conditions. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole \nsupports a fair and commonsense decision in favor of the Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked as a consultant since about December 2020. He has also been self-employed as a consultant since about July 2017. He is a citizen of Nigeria and a naturalized U.S. citizen. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in 2010. He is twice divorced. He married for the third time in December 2017. He is a father to seven- year-old twins and a three-year-old. (Tr. 20-27, 65; GE 1, 2) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts totaling approximately $35,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). These delinquencies were for credit cards. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact and are corroborated by the Government\u2019s February 2023 and May 2022 credit reports. Despite being required to do so, Applicant did not divulge these financial delinquencies on his October 2021 security clearance application (SCA). During his November 2021 security interview, he did not disclose these delinquencies until the investigator confronted him with them.

He has also been self-employed \nas a consultant since about July 2017. He is a citizen of Nigeria and a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004 and a master\u2019s degree in 2010. He is \ntwice divorced. He married for the third time in December 2017. He is a father to seven-\nyear-old twins and a three-year-old. (Tr. 20-27, 65; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $35,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). These delinquencies were for credit \ncards. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings \nof fact and are corroborated by the Government\u2019s February 2023 and May 2022 credit \nreports. Despite being required to do so, Applicant did not divulge these financial \ndelinquencies on his October 2021 security clearance application (SCA). During his \nNovember 2021 security interview, he did not disclose these delinquencies until the \ninvestigator confronted him with them. These failures to voluntarily divulge his financial \ndelinquencies were not listed on the SOR. Any adverse information not alleged in the \nSOR, such as Applicant\u2019s failure to divulge financial delinquencies, cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (SOR; Answer; GE 2-4) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $20,848 listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a has been \nresolved. Applicant opened this credit card in June 2016 to pay for living expenses. He \nbecame delinquent on the account in February 2020. He claimed he fell behind on this \naccount because of the extra expenses he incurred because one of his children was \ndiagnosed with autism. He also claimed that he was not making nearly as much money \nin February 2020 as he currently does. During his November 2021 security interview, he \nclaimed that he had a dispute with some of the charges on the account. He provided no \ndocumentation to corroborate or substantiate the nature or validity of his dispute with \nthe charges on this account. He first contacted the creditor to settle this account in \nabout January or February 2022. After a delay caused by his indecisiveness regarding \nthe effect his settlement would have on the mortgage he was attempting to secure, \nApplicant made a payment arrangement to pay off this debt in July 2022. He complied \nwith this payment arrangement by paying a down payment of $2,999, five monthly \npayments of $2,000, and a $4,000 payment in January 2023. He provided an undated \ndocument reflecting that he settled this account for less than the full balance.

He provided no documentation to \ncorroborate or substantiate the nature or validity of his dispute with his employer or his \nefforts to resolve it. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that the \ncreditor denied his access to the account. He claimed he fell behind on this account \nbecause of his dispute, because he did not have access to this account, because of the \nextra expenses he incurred because one of his children was diagnosed with autism, and \nbecause he was not making nearly as much money in 2018 as he currently does. After \nhis account access was allegedly denied, on several occasions, he received written \ncommunications from the creditor advising him that his account was delinquent and \nproviding contact information to resolve it. In August 2022, he settled the account for \nless than the full balance by making a lump-sum payment of $1,989. He provided a \ndocument from the creditor dated August 24, 2022, reflecting the terms of his pending \nsettlement. The February 2023 credit report corroborates that he settled the account. \n(Tr. 17-19, 46-61, 65-69; Answer; GE 2-4; AE A, C) \nSince about early 2018, Applicant has earned at least $165,000 to $200,000 \nannually in salary. He did not provide information regarding his earnings prior to 2018. \nBeginning in December 2020, he earned about $390,000 in annual wages. Applicant\u2019s \nwife, a Nigerian citizen, earns about $200,000 in annual wages. She and Applicant\u2019s \nchildren lived in Country A, so they do not combine their income. Instead, they pay their \nexpenses separately. Applicant, his spouse, and his children now live together in the \nUnited States. Applicant has approximately $50,000 to $100,000 in a savings account. \nHe has several hundred thousand dollars invested in stocks. He has about $100,000 \ninvested in a retirement account. In about May 2016, he purchased a home for over \n$400,000. His monthly mortgage is about $3,300. In 2015, he financed the purchase of \na vehicle for $72,000. His monthly payments on this vehicle were over $900 until he \nsatisfied the car note in about July 2021. (Tr. 21-27, 63-65, 69-71) \nWhile Applicant was delinquent on at least one of the SOR accounts, he took \nnumerous trips involving international flights that were not related to work. Some of \nthese trips were vacations. Some were trips to visit his family in Country A. Some were \nto visit his family in Country B. Applicant claimed that his wife paid for some of these \ntrips with her own income, but he did not specify which trips and he did not provide any \ndocumentation to corroborate this claim. Applicant acknowledged that several of the \ntrips he made that he paid for while the SOR accounts were delinquent cost at least \n$1,000 each. (Tr. 55-59; GE 1, 2) \nIn addition to not earning as much money as he later did, having disputes about \nboth SOR delinquencies, and having a child diagnosed with autism, Applicant claimed \nhe did not settle his debts until after the SOR was issued because he had to pay for \nother expenses for his family. For example, he claimed that he had to pay for a live-in \nnanny in Country A, and he had to pay for his family and him to make trips to visit one \nanother. He also claimed that he has always had enough money to pay his debts, but \nhe did not prioritize the SOR debts until the time he satisfied them.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had two delinquent debts totaling about $35,000 that were delinquent \nfor years. Despite earning a significant amount of money since 2018, his expenses \ninitially left him unable to pay these debts. In December 2020, he almost doubled his \nalready significant salary. At that point, (and possibly earlier), he had the ability to \nsatisfy these debts but chose not to until after the Government issued the SOR. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nWhile Applicant has resolved his delinquencies by settling them for less than the \nfull amount, he did not do so until after he received his SOR. An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her \nclearance or eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nand willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). He \ntherefore has not shown that he resolved the debts in good faith. He settled the second \nof his delinquent debts about two months ago, so he has not established a track record \nof financial responsibility sufficient to show that his financial delinquencies are unlikely \nto recur. \nHe has provided evidence that his delinquencies resulted (at least in part) from \nhis child\u2019s autism and were therefore beyond his control. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to \napply, he must also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to these debts. As he waited until July 2022 to begin to pay these debts despite \nhaving the means to do so earlier, he has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nApplicant claimed that he had disputes regarding both SOR debts. However, he \nprovided no documentary evidence to substantiate any fraudulent charges for the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a or that his former employer should have paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He \nalso did not provide documentary corroboration that he disputed the debts with the \ncreditor, the credit reporting agencies, or his former employer. It is reasonable to expect \nApplicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Absent this proof, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to show that his disputes were reasonable. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) partially apply. None of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions are fully applicable and the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant was evasive \nduring his testimony. He claimed that he could not remember recent, noteworthy dates, \nsuch as an approximation of when he began working for his current employer or when \nhe contacted creditors. Multiple times during the hearing, I admonished him to answer \nappropriate cross-examination questions.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife has included the debt, alleged in subparagraph 1.a, in a \nbankruptcy filing, negating the creditor\u2019s ability to accept payments towards its satisfaction, \nand she has taken responsibility for the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.e under a \nsettlement agreement, leaving Applicant only responsible for the debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, and 1.f. He satisfied all of these remaining debts. \nAlthough Applicant certainly could have documented his attempts at satisfying these \ndebts earlier, he has clearly established that he has no current financial problems. \nMoreover, his payment of all the delinquent debts, for which he was responsible, bolsters \nthe credibility of his contention that his financial problems were a temporary aberration \ncaused by the income reduction he experienced after his divorce. I conclude that all of the \nmitigating conditions, as set forth above, are applicable. Applicable has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nGiven the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s incurrence of the delinquent debt, \nand his satisfaction of the debts for which he remains responsible, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness position.

The debts are\nlisted on an August 2021 credit report, a November 2022 credit report, or both credit \nreports. Most of the debts were opened from 2015 through 2018 and became \ndelinquent between 2017 and 2019. (Tr. at 26, 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-\n3) \n \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties primarily to his and his wife\u2019s medical \nproblems, which were compounded by employment issues. His wife developed cancer \nin about 2009, their medical insurance did not cover all the bills, and she was out of \nwork for about six to eight months. In about 2017, she had surgery, and she was out of \nwork for at least a month. In about 2021 or 2022, she had an organ transplant, and she \nwas out of work for about two months. She also has a sporadic work history due to \nworking for non-profits that had funding issues. He had surgery in about 2022, which \ncaused him to be out of work for about three weeks. He lost a job he held for around 35 \nyears in about September 2020, and was unemployed for two to three weeks before he \nobtained his current job. He believes the COVID-19 pandemic led to the company \nletting him go. He earned about $17.50 an hour at his previous job, and about $15 an \nhour at his current job. (Tr. at 14-17, 20, 22-27, 43, 46; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant started addressing his delinquent debts in about 2020. The August \n2021 credit report lists four collection accounts that were paid or settled in 2020 or \n2021. He also settled a debt for $292, with the last payment in August 2021. Those five \ndebts, which totaled about $1,800, were not alleged in the SOR because they were \nresolved before the SOR was issued. (Tr. at 41; GE 1-3; AE A, B) \nApplicant settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f before the SOR was issued, with \nthe final payment of $372 in January 2022. The August 2021 credit report listed the \nbalance of the debt as $1,060. The SOR alleged the debt as $688. It is unclear where \nthat amount came come, possibly another credit report that was not offered in evidence. \nThe November 2022 credit report lists the balance as $0. (Tr. at 33; GE 2, 3; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; AE D) \nApplicant and the collection company for the $428 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i \nagreed to resolve the debt through six monthly payments of $68, starting in January \n2023. Applicant documented that he made the first four payments. The last two \npayments were not due as of the date of the hearing.

(Tr. at 32; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant borrowed about $14,500 from his 401(k) retirement account with his \nprevious employer. When he was laid off, he was unable to pay back the loan, and it \nwas treated by the IRS as a distribution from his retirement account, which created tax \nconsequences in tax year 2021. He paid about $1,100 to resolve the state tax debt. For \nabout the last year, he has been paying the IRS around $189 per month on a tax debt \nthat was originally about $4,000. (Tr. at 17-20, 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nThere are another six SOR debts totaling about $27,600 that have not been \naddressed. Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, but they have improved. His wife is \ncurrently working full time, and he is starting to get overtime hours. He is a disabled \nveteran and receives about $1,100 a month from the Department of Veterans Affairs. \nHe worked to resolve his smaller debts first, in the hope that he could then secure a \nloan to pay or settle all of them. He credibly testified that he planned to continue that \ncourse until all the delinquent debts and taxes are paid, either collectively through a \nloan, or individually one at a time. (Tr. at 15, 21-24, 27-44, 46; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1-3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were primarily related to his and his wife\u2019s medical \nproblems and their employment issues. He started addressing his delinquent debts in \nabout 2020, well before the SOR was issued. He resolved five non-SOR debts, which \ntotaled about $1,800, before the SOR was issued, and he resolved a $1,060 debt \n(alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f as $688), in January 2022, before the SOR was issued. He \nresolved the $663 and $526 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h in April and May 2023. \nHe completed four of the six $68 monthly payments to resolve the $428 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. He paid his state taxes, and he has been paying his installment agreement \nwith the IRS for about a year. He credibly testified that he planned to continue to pay all \nhis delinquent debts and taxes, either collectively through a loan, or individually one at a \ntime. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first.

I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.1 \n1 Appendix C of the adjudicative guidelines gives me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite \nthe presence of issue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that \nadditional security measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have \nconcluded the issues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s \nfinances. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on September 12, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated nine delinquent \ndebts exceeding $25,000. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations, denying \nonly the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, and 1.h-1.i. He claimed he was sued \nby the creditor associated with SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e and received dismissals in both \ncases for lack of supporting contract documentation. He claimed disputes over SOR \u00b6\u00b6  \n1.h and 1.i for lack of recognition. For those admitted allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.d, he claimed settlement agreements were reached with the respective \ncreditors.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 2008 and has one daughter (age 13) from this \nmarriage. (GE 1) He earned a high school diploma in June 2004, an associates degree \nin August 2013, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration in August 2016. \n(GE 1) He enlisted in the Army in May 2005 and served four years of active duty before \nreceiving an honorable discharge in May 2009. (GE 1) \nSince October 2009, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nsubcontract manager. (GE 1; Tr. 28-29) He has held a security clearance since \nFebruary 2012.

(GE 8; Tr. 25-26) Child \nemergencies depleted his family\u2019s savings and contributed to the disarray of his \nfinances and resulting delinquencies in his accounts. (Tr. 27-28) \nAll of Applicant\u2019s cited consumer accounts remain delinquent and unaddressed \nat this time, the result of either unsuccessful creditor enforcement action (SOR \u00b6 1.a) or \nApplicant\u2019s failure to devote sufficient attention to his listed-SOR debts (i.e., SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.g). (GEs 4-7) To help him in addressing his delinquent accounts and clear them \nfrom his credit report, he pursued debt consolidation and credit repair in 2017. (Tr. 42) \nAfter several months of working with the credit repair firm without any tangible results, \nhe ceased using the firm. (Tr. 42-43) Applicant currently has no documented plans to \naddress and pay off his SOR-listed creditors. (Tr. 53-61) \nApplicant earns $93,400 annually in base salary and earns additional overtime \nhours (10 to 12) monthly. (Tr. 30) After taxes, he nets approximately $6,400 a month \nfrom his work. And, he receives an additional $820 a month in disability benefits from \nthe Veterans Administration (VA). (Tr. 30-31) \nContributing to his monthly income is his wife who, although not currently \nemployed, receives $17,500 a month in disability benefits. (Tr. 32) Applicant currently \nhas $3,230 in his checking account and $40,000 in a savings account. (Tr. 33) He also \nhas a modest 401(k) retirement account.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. Both need to be considered together in making a comprehensiv whole-\nperson evaluation. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n           The Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  . .

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited medical issues associated with his young son\u2019s medical \ncomplications contributed considerably to his accumulated debt delinquencies. His \ndelinquent debts (opened individually by Applicant) accrued during his marriage reflect \nsome extenuating circumstances beyond his ability to manage and control. Considering \nall of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s added financial burdens, mitigating \ncondition (MC) \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent accounts once the issues associated \nwith his son\u2019s medical complications stabilized and he had regained his financial footing, \nprevented him from taking advantage of the full benefits of MC \u00b620(b). Because he has \nnot demonstrated enough diligent exercise of financial responsibility while dealing with \nhis son\u2019s medical issues, he is not in a position to take full advantage of the second \nprong of MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cacted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Without more \ndemonstrated effort in addressing his major debts, Applicant cannot meet the minimum \neligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

This debt is owed to a cellular telephone carrier. Applicant stated \nduring his PSI that he changed carriers and received a bill for approximately $300 for one \nmonth of service. He contacted the company and asked what plan he was on that cost \n$600 for two months. The carrier was not able to provide information on any plan that \ncost that amount.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant experienced a significant decrease in income in 2020 due to the COVID\u00ad\n19 pandemic and a brief period of unemployment in November 2021. He primarily \nattributes his delinquent debts to his decreased income, which was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e are listed as disputed on Applicant\u2019s \nApril 2022 CBR and do not appear on his January 2023 CBR. His bases for his disputes \nare legitimate. These debts are resolved. The $145 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g \nhas been paid. \nThere is no record evidence that Applicant formally disputed the $3,908 debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c), owed to the dental clinic for his braces, with the creditor or with the credit reporting \nagencies. While he may have had a legitimate dispute with the application of his braces \nand the dental clinic\u2019s refusal to address the issues he was having with them, simply \nrefusing to pay a contractual obligation due to dissatisfaction is not a valid legal remedy. \nApplicant has not paid or otherwise resolved the $686 cellular-telephone service \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He explained his dissatisfaction with the billing and that he \nterminated his service as a result, but that does not relieve him of his obligation to pay \nthe debt. \nWhile the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f are not listed on Applicant\u2019s January \n2023 CBR, there is no record evidence that they have been resolved. Merely waiting for \na debt to drop off a credit report by the passage of time is not a factor in an applicant\u2019s \nfavor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nApplicant has not paid or otherwise addressed the $40,308 balance due on a \nrepossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 1.a). While his loss of income due to the COVID-19 \npandemic may have been the cause of his inability to pay his vehicle-loan payments which \nresulted in the repossession, a circumstance largely beyond his control, he has not acted \nresponsibly. His one telephone call to the creditor, which no longer had access to \nApplicant\u2019s account information, does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve this \ndebt. This debt comprises more than 72% of the total SOR debt.

Yet, he has not taken \nany action to address this significant debt. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. He has not paid or otherwise \nmade any measurable effort to resolve his over $40,000 delinquent vehicle-loan debt. His \nrefusal to pay his $3,908 dental-clinic debt due to his dissatisfaction with his braces and \nhis refusal to pay the $686 cellular-telephone service debt due to his dissatisfaction with \nthe company\u2019s billing practices does not resolve these debts. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply to the unresolved SOR debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Marine Corps from 2003 until 2015 and was first \ngranted a security clearance while on active duty. He also experienced an unforeseen \nreduction in income in 2020. However, his lack of any identifiable action to resolve the \nmajority of his delinquent debt outweighs the positive information in his background. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his ongoing financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not file all his federal and state income tax returns when they were \ndue. AG \u00b6 19(f) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant went through a tumultuous period. He separated and divorced, moved \nto a new state, had back surgery, and went through the COVID-19 pandemic. Then a \nhurricane damaged his home. He also admitted that he should have been more diligent \nabout his taxes, but his personal life was in turmoil, and he just kept putting off filing the \nreturns. All the returns were filed in June 2022, before the SOR was issued, and all the \ntaxes were paid. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nI found Applicant to be honest and truthful. I am convinced that he has learned a \nvaluable and costly lesson, and that all future returns and taxes will be filed and paid on \ntime. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He has held a Secret security \nclearance since November 2016 and seeks to retain it as a requirement of his continued \nemployment. (GE 1; Tr. 10-12) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1993.

(GE 3) He elaborated on \nhis marijuana use in his September 6, 2022 SOR Answer as well as during his \ntestimony. The following summarizes that marijuana use. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout January 1995 to about September 2021. He admitted this allegation with \nexplanations. (SOR Answer) He smoked marijuana occasionally in his early 20s, but in \n2002 he started a family and pursued a Ph.D. in electrical engineering that took him 13 \nyears to complete. Applicant did not use marijuana again until mid-2017 when it was \nlegalized in his state of residence. (SOR Answer) \nDuring his hearing, Applicant stated that he first used marijuana \u201cshortly after \nhigh school\u201d and did not use it in a consistent pattern. While Applicant was attending a \ncommunity college before transferring to a university where he was awarded his \nbachelor\u2019s degree, he estimated he used marijuana \u201ca small handful of times . . . not \nvery often.\u201d (Tr. 21-23) When he transferred to a university setting, he \u201cwas just hanging \nout with a bunch of Engineers.\u201d Applicant was married the entire time he was in a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuniversity setting pursuing his Ph.D. Neither he nor his wife used marijuana during this \ntimeframe.

It just sort of started surfacing through different social \nnetworks.\u201d It was \u201csometime, middle to the end of 2017,\u201d that his wife came home with a \nvape pen, \u201clike an e-cigarette.\u201d (Tr. 23-24, 31) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2016 to September 2021 while granted access to classified information. He \nadmitted this allegation with explanations. (SOR Answer) He added, \u201cto date I have \nnever been in possession of or had access to classified information.\u201d (SOR Answer) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife came home with an electronic cigarette in 2017, she told \nhim that it was a hemp-derived version called Delta-8 THC and was legal in all states. \nApplicant researched whether his wife\u2019s claim, as well as the same claim of a friend he \nplayed hockey with, was accurate and found the laws to be conflicting. He used the \nambiguity of the laws to justify his infrequent use of these products and began to use \nthem sporadically because, as a writer, its use would help him to write. He reiterated \nand acknowledged that was a \u201cbig mistake\u201d and stated he would not make that same \nmistake again. He only used these products with his wife or by himself. Applicant fully \nadmitted that he got it wrong. (Tr. 19-20, 24-25, 32, 39) \nApplicant told the investigator during his January 4, 2022 OPM interview that he \nplanned to continue \u201cto use this stuff\u201d because he had convinced himself \u201cthat it wasn\u2019t \na big deal.\u201d Applicant acknowledged this response was \u201cvery wrong\u201d and is \u201cvery \nremorseful\u201d for making that statement. He \u201cmis-understood the severity of the choice \nand how the Federal Government would see this.\u201d He credibly expressed that he was \nsorry and stated that \u201cit won\u2019t happen again.\u201d (Tr. 20) Applicant said that he last used \nDelta-8 THC shortly after his OPM interview, stating that he was \u201cthick-headed\u201d not \nrealizing the \u201cmagnitude of this.\u201d Shortly after his OPM interview, and \u201cmaybe eight \nmonths\u201d ago, Applicant stopped using marijuana completely. In his post-hearing \nstatement, he clarified that he had not used any marijuana products over the past year. \nHe added that it was not hard for him to stop using marijuana nor does he miss using it. \n(Tr. 25-27, 30; AE C) \nApplicant underwent a pre-employment drug test when he was initially hired as \nan intern. He stated that his employer provides training but does not recall any specific \ntraining on his company\u2019s drug policy. He realizes Federal law \u201ctrumps\u201d state law. He \nhas not undergone any random drug screenings since he began his employment in \n2006. (Tr. 27-28) When Applicant completed his November 3, 2021 SF-86, he stated \nthat he wrote songs and occasionally used marijuana to generate new ideas. He added \nthat if marijuana use became an impediment to obtaining his clearance, he would refrain \nfrom further use as he was not \u201cvery attached to it.\u201d He testified that he provided that \nresponse because he was mistaken regarding the state of the law and acknowledged \nthat he \u201ccould have made a better choice . . . and stopped right then.\u201d (Tr. 20-21; GE 2) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant stated that his wife no longer uses marijuana.

Apart from a fellow hockey team player \nwho sometimes uses a vape pen, Applicant does not find himself in any situations \nwhere marijuana is used. He is not tempted to use marijuana on the rare occasion his \nhockey teammate uses marijuana. (Tr. 30-31) \nApplicant \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d understands the Government\u2019s zero tolerance policy \nwith regard to drug use, even if a drug is legal in one\u2019s state of residence under state \nlaw but not Federal law. (Tr. 32-33, 39-40) Applicant submitted a signed statement of \nintent, dated January 29, 2023, to abstain from all hemp derived products regardless of \ntheir legal status at state and Federal levels. He added that he has not consumed any of \nthese products for the past year and is fully committed to maintaining abstinence. (Tr. \n33-34; AE C) Similarly, Applicant\u2019s wife submitted a signed statement, dated January \n29, 2023, expressing her committed support of her husband\u2019s decision to abstain from \nall hemp products. She added that she discontinued her use of all such products. (Tr. \n33-34; AE B) \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted an email referencing research he conducted \non the legality of consuming hemp derived Delta-8 THC. He stated that based on his \nresearch it was his belief that Delta-8 THC is legal Federally as well as in his state of \nresidence. With that in mind, he asserted that he did not violate his employer\u2019s zero \ndrug tolerance policy as his employer\u2019s policy only pertains to the consumption of illegal \ndrugs. Regardless, Applicant stated that he would abstain either way. (AE L) Applicant \nsubmitted a second email with citations and further discussion supporting his position. \n(AE M) [Note \u2013 DOD policy does not permit the use Delta 8 THC. See discussion under \nAnalysis section infra.] \nIn response and in summary, Department Counsel stated that Applicant made no \nreference to using Delta-8 THC when he completed his November 3, 2021 SF-86 nor in \nhis January 4, 2022 OPM interview. She noted that Applicant specifically referred to \n\u201cmarijuana\u201d and \u201cTHC\u201d adding that he expressed an intent to continue using it, even \nwhen he was not certain whether it was permissible to do so while holding a security \nclearance. She concluded that even if Applicant were to establish that he currently has \na reasonable basis to believe that the product he was using was legal and Farm Bill-\ncompliant, his use occurred while he had doubts about its legality and reflected \nadversely on his judgment.

His family on both sides has been in the \nUnited States \u201csince before the Mayflower.\u201d He has built his entire career being of \nservice to the United States. He is very proud of being able to solve problems \u201cthat \nnobody else could\u201d on a Navy platform. He continues to work on programs that impact \nthe client\u2019s wellbeing and would like to make more contributions, if allowed. He viewed \nthe outcome of this decision not only as being important to him and is family, but to the \ncountry as well. (Tr. 20) \nApplicant submitted a reference letter from his functional manager (FM), who has \nknown Applicant for the past five years, first as his technical lead and later as his \nfunctional manager. [FM described Applicant\u2019s projects, past and present. Identifying \nthese projects would in all likelihood provide information leading to the identify of \nprojects and parties concerned. Suffice it to say, the projects involved are of critical \nimportance and vital to the national defense.] Applicant has a proven track record of \nworking on highly sophisticated platforms and is the \u201conly member of [FM\u2019s] team that \nhas both capability and drive to address these efforts in the short time-frames that are \navailable on these programs.\u201d Applicant is assigned to multiple programs as a subject \nmatter expert. In this role besides learning the needed control technology and applying \nhis technical skills, Applicant serves as a sounding board and mentor to junior \nengineers. (AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s work performance evaluations from 2017 to 2023 reflect sustained \nsuperior performance and provided specific examples of his contribution to the national \ndefense. (AE - I) For example, his 2023 evaluation states, \u201c[Applicant] continued to be \nsought by [client] for his control design expertise. [Applicant] is deeply respected for his \ncreativity, intellect, passion, maturity, and good nature and should continue to be a \ntremendous asset for [employer] in the years to come.\u201d \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] work was \nacknowledged by the senior leadership. He has been asked to obtain a clearance so \nthat he can employ his work on several programs.\u201d (Tr. 35; AE I) \nIn addition to his contribution to the national defense, Applicant likewise \ncontributes to his local community. He developed a passion for teaching while he was a \ngraduate student working on his Ph.D. He participates in a company-sponsored \nprogram to encourage young people to pursue careers in science and engineering. He \ndeveloped a curriculum and leads classroom laboratory sessions for elementary \nstudents in electricity, magnetism, and the fundamentals of circuit design. Applicant \nparticipates in career days where he gives presentations on exciting engineering \nprojects to middle schoolers. He provided a photograph of him in the \u2018teaching mode\u201d \nand copies of numerous thank you notes from students who benefited from his \nteaching.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(f) any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition.\u201d Applicant held a security clearance and did not have access to classified \ninformation, but did hold a sensitive position. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated \nclarifying guidance concerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance \nadjudications.

The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether \nthe individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including \nby signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, \nin light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug \nuse while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 \n(SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA \nClarifying Guidance), ES 2021-01529, at page 2. \nThese proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his marijuana use \non his November 3, 2021 SF-86, and later during his January 4, 2022 OPM interview. \nWhile Applicant may have concluded that his use of Delta-8 THC products did not \nviolate Federal law, his use at the time while in a state of uncertainty raises a security \nconcern. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, \nas referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). \nSee \nDrug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nlisting \nat \nhttps://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c cs alpha.pdf. These self-\ndisclosures establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(f). Further review is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred before he fully \nrealized the implications of marijuana involvement. As such, his marijuana use \n\u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 26(b) partially applies because Applicant acknowledged his marijuana \ninvolvement and substance misuse. He provided evidence of his actions taken to \novercome this problem, and he established a pattern of abstinence, including: (1) \ndisassociation from most of his drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nHis spouse also submitted a signed statement expressing her commitment to support \nher husband decision to abstain from all hemp products. She also discontinued all use \nand plans to abstain going forward. Applicant did not indicate he would disassociate \nwith others who use marijuana. Prong AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) is difficult to fully satisfy because \nmarijuana use is so common and, apart from his friend on the hockey team, it is difficult \nto know about whether he has other associates who use marijuana. \nConcerning AG \u00b6 26(a), there are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when\nconduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the record within the parameters set by the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd.

Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board \nreversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use \nfor five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 \nplus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle change and therapy. For the \nrecency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format corrections added). \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was approximately \u201ca year\u201d before his December \n2022 hearing. I accept his post-hearing recollection of time elapsed versus the answer \nhe gave during his hearing as being more accurate. His history of using marijuana was \ninfrequent and sporadic. Using marijuana while holding a clearance is arguably of the \nmost concern in this case. Applicant explained that his decision to use marijuana with \nvarying frequency after it was legalized in his state of residence stemmed from a \ncombination of factors to include his uncertainty over the legality of its use, emerging \nsocietal norms, and a mistake in judgment. He cannot undo the past, but he intends to \navoid making the same mistake going forward. Applicant recognized that mistake, \nadmitted and accepted responsibility for making that mistake, and promised to adhere \nto DOD\u2019s zero drug tolerance policy. \nThe record contains persuasive evidence that Applicant has turned the corner on \nachieving drug abstinence. Applicant\u2019s self-reflection, change in behavior, and support \nfrom his family, friends, and associates, in addition to about one year of abstinence, are \nindicative of an individual who wants to right his course. The absence of evidence of \nmore recent or extensive drug use, and his commitment not to use illegal drugs in the \nfuture, eliminates doubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment with respect to illegal drug use. \nApplicant\u2019s reference letters document that he is an individual who possesses \ncharacter and integrity. Applicant\u2019s work performance evaluations reflect the caliber of \nperformance the contribution he is making towards the national defense. His \nperformance further reflects that his work behavior is not indicative of someone with a \ndrug problem. As an employee, he is viewed as reliable, a constant learner, and an \nindividual with integrity. At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that future drug abuse \nis incompatible with his career and family plans and manifested a steadfast commitment \nto continue lifestyle changes consistent with total abstinence of involvement with all \nillegal drugs. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant volunteered the information about his marijuana involvement. His \nmarijuana involvement was not detected in a urinalysis, in a post-polygraph interview, \nthrough OPM interviews of his associates, or through a law enforcement investigation. I \nam satisfied that he will keep his promise not to possess or use marijuana in the future. \nHis history of marijuana use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s credibility, I did so after assessing his demeanor, which \ncan most effectively be done by personal observation, overall candor on other matters, \nand reputation among his superiors and peers. Given the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s \nbackground, his explanation for his actions, and his subsequent actions, I find his \ndescription of his history of past drug use and assertion that he will not use any illegal \nsubstance in the future were sincere and credible. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b), 26(b)(1), \n26(b)(2), 26(b)(3) apply. Drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nIn his April 22, 2016 SF-86, Applicant stated \u201cno\u201d when queried whether he had \nillegally used any controlled substance in the last seven years. He answered \u201cno\u201d \nbecause when he completed that SF-86 he had not used marijuana for approximately \n14 years. He did not use marijuana until 2017 after it had been legalized in his state of \nresidence. In short, Applicant truthfully answered the question about past drug use and \ntherefore did not falsify his SF-86. The evidence does not support the allegation under \nthis concern. \nMy credibility assessment of Applicant discussed under Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Abuse, supra, is applicable under this section. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony \nto be consistently credible throughout his hearing, even when doing so exposed him to \ngreater liability. I accept his statement that that he understood the gravity and \nimportance of being transparent. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that no evidence \nsupports this allegation, further discussion regarding disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions is not warranted. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guidelines H and E is \nincorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \nTo review, Applicant is employed as a senior control systems engineer for a \ndefense contractor. He has worked on a number of major projects of critical importance \nto the national defense. I note that Applicant has demonstrated considerable \nperseverance by committing 13 years of his life to earn a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. \nHe has shown a similar commitment to dedicating his adult working life to the defense \nindustry since 2006. Application of the mitigating conditions as well as a whole-person \nassessment support a favorable adjudication in Applicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant self-reported his drug use on his most recent SF-86 knowing that such \ndisclosure could jeopardize his clearance eligibility. His recognizes that his choice to use \nmarijuana or Delta-8 THC is incompatible with DOD regulations and is committed to \nrefrain from all further use. He enjoys the full support of his spouse in abstaining from its \nuse. He recognizes that his decision to use Delta-8 THC even if \u201clegal\u201d is incompatible \nwith DOD policy and contrary to the direction he wants to take his career. While \nlegalized marijuana and its derivatives may have gained greater acceptance as a result \nof emerging social norms, Applicant understands that any future use would be cause to \nend his access to classified information. In short, his lifestyle changes since he stopped \nusing marijuana are significant, noteworthy, and eliminated any potential for pressure, \ncoercion, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s employer, friends, and family support him. He has a history of stable \nemployment and a strong work ethic. This level of support and self-introspection should \nensure his continued success. His wife and three children rely on him for financial \nsupport. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and commitment to remaining drug \nfree. He has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. \nHe was serious, candid, and credible at his hearing. His past, present, and future \ncontributions to the national defense are substantial, and far more important to him than \nrecreational use of THC. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClarifying guidance provided by the December 21, 2021 SecEA concerning \nmarijuana-related issues cited supra was particularly instructive in evaluating this \noutcome. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Item 3 at 2; Response at 1.) He also acknowledges he used it for \nnon-medicinal reasons. In his Response he stated he did not want to lie about his \nmarijuana use. He noted the prevalence of marijuana use in the U.S. and the trends \ntowards legalization in expressing his hope that an otherwise qualified applicant would \nnot be disqualified solely based on marijuana use.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n3 \n\n \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n Analysis \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n          \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his Response, and elsewhere in the record \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25: \nany substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n (a): \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum \nentitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 DNI Memo) which \nmakes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this issue:   \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has cited the 2014 DNI Memo in holding that \u201cstate laws \nallowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited circumstances do not pre-empt \nprovisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the Department of Defense is not bound \nby the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state law when adjudicating that individual\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 18, 2016).  \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise\nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access classified\ninformation or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs\nindicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not\ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility\nto hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant fully acknowledges his drug use and has \nstated his intent to continue to use marijuana. He has not provided a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3 (App. Bd.

See also ISCR Case No. 16-00258 at fn. 1 (App. Bd. Feb. \n23, 2018) (\u201cIt merits noting, however, that while several states have decriminalized \nmarijuana or allowed its use for medical or recreational purposes, such use of marijuana \nremains subject to the applicable disqualifying conditions in the Directive.\u201d) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because he requested a determination \non the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). \nI considered Applicant's admissions and explanations, including his explanation \nfor his medical use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s position on marijuana was clear concerning \nhis use of medical marijuana and his other reasons for his stated intentions to continue \nusing marijuana, However, marijuana use remains illegal under Federal law and for \ncleared individuals, so his marijuana involvement and stated intentions of future use are \nunmitigated security concerns. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug \ninvolvement. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraph 1.a:  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On October 26, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The DoD acted under \nExecutive Order (Ex.

Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on January 4, 2023.

Applicant did not submit a response or \nobject to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 4 and 5 are admitted into evidence. The case \nwas assigned to me on April 3, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nDepartment Counsel submitted Items 6 and 7 and asked that I take administrative \nnotice of relevant facts about Taiwan. Without objection, I have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written \nrequest and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note: \nThe United States recognizes the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging \nthe Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. \nThe United States maintains cultural, commercial, and other unofficial \nrelations with the people of Taiwan. The 2019 U.S. Department of State \nreport on human rights in Taiwan noted that there were no reports of \nsignificant human rights abuses. However, throughout 2019, Beijing \nadopted a more coercive policy toward Taiwan, seeking to isolate and \nintimidate Taipei into unification on Beijing\u2019s terms. Taiwan is an active \ncollector of U.S. economic technologies that have sensitive military \napplications. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s two grandfathers, uncle, two \naunts, and a cousin are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant admits each of these \nallegations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a through 1d). His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He was born in Taiwan. He has worked for a defense \ncontractor since August 2021. He came to the United States with his parents in 1999. His \nparents live in the United States and maintain dual citizenship with both countries. He and \nhis parents became U.S. citizens in 2010. He holds both  U.S. and Taiwanese passports. \nHis sister was born in the United States in 2000 and resides in the United States. He \ngraduated high school in 2015 and received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. (Item 4 at 14-\n15.) \nFrom 2014 through 2018, while he was a student, Applicant traveled each year to \nTaiwan during the summer months. (Item 5 at 10.)

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).\n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under \na foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. The mere possession of \nties with family in Taiwan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nHowever, if an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). The totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries hostile \nto the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at \n5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical \nfields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at 11-12 (App. Bd. Oct. \n27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing \nTaiwan). \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Taiwan sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(a). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nWhen foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. \n01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). Applicant discussed during his security clearance \ninterview and in his interrogatory responses his visits to his family in Taiwan.

There is no evidence his family has ties to the \ngovernment. Applicant has not traveled to visit his relatives in Taiwan since 2018 and his \ncontacts have become less frequent since he graduated college. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \nApplicant considers himself an American first, and at age 27, his retirement plans \nare several decades in the future. The relationships alleged are not immediate family \nmembers. His immediate family all reside in the United States. The record evidence is \nsufficient to mitigate the concern under AG \u00b6 8(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I weighed this consideration in reviewing Applicant\u2019s security clearance \ninterview, which was thorough, and affirmed by him in response to interrogatories. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his contacts with his family in Taiwan. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance.

She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1998. \nShe married in 2009 and divorced in 2022. She has two children who reside with her. This \nis her first application for a security clearance. (GX 3; GX 4.) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $16,535. The debts are comprised \nof three credit-card debts totaling $5,306; four medical debts totaling $3,295; and a \nfederal-tax debt in the amount of $7,934. The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to \ntimely file her 2019 federal-tax return and that it remains unfiled. In her answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted the credit-card debts and three of the medical debts, but denied \none medical debt in the amount of $100. She also denied the federal-tax debt, stating that \nshe was in a repayment plan. She admitted that she failed to timely file her 2019 federal-\ntax return.

She admitted the $100 medical debt she had \npreviously denied, denied the federal-tax debt stating that she had satisfactorily \ncompleted her repayment plan in December 2022, and denied that she had failed to file \nher 2019 federal tax return, stating that she filed it in February 2023. She provided \ndocumentation in support of her denials. (Response.) \nFor an unspecified period of time, Applicant\u2019s husband suffered from multiple \nhealth-related issues that frequently rendered him unable to work. During the times he \nwas out of work, he sometimes would receive short-term-disability payments, but not \nalways. The short-term-disability payments were significantly less than his regular pay. \nApplicant and her husband were dependent on both their regular incomes to pay their \nmonthly obligations, and the decreased household income caused them financial strain. \nAdditionally, despite having health insurance, Applicant incurred unanticipated medical \ndebts from giving birth to their second child in 2017. These combined factors caused \nApplicant and her husband to be unable to maintain three of their credit-card accounts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c).

(GX 4; Response; GX \n6; GX 5.) \nThroughout their marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband was responsible for filing their joint \nfederal-tax returns. Applicant was initially unaware that her husband did not do so for tax \nyear 2019. Ultimately, Applicant prepared the 2019 return herself and filed it on February \n6, 2023. She did not owe any taxes. (GX 3; GX 4; Response.) \nApplicant timely filed her 2021 federal-tax return with a payment of $2,604. \nHowever, she owed an additional $9,621. She received notice from the IRS sent on June \n6, 2022, of the additional taxes owed and immediately contacted them. She entered a \nshort-term payment plan and submitted the first payment in July 2022. She made all the \nrequired payments and satisfied her federal-tax debt for 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) in December \n2022. (GX 4; Answer; Response.) \nApplicant and her husband began their divorce proceedings in May 2021, at which \ntime all their marital assets were frozen. She had custody of their two children and was \nprimarily financially responsible for all of their care. She did not have the financial \nresources to resolve any of her delinquent accounts. The final divorce decree was not \nentered until July 2022. (GX 3; GX 7.) \nThe final divorce decree delineates 10 marital debts for which Applicant was held \npersonally liable. Four of the debts assigned to Applicant in the divorce decree are SOR \ndebts. One of the listed debts is a medical debt owed to a creditor to whom Applicant \nowes two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). She contacted the creditor and in September 2022, \nApplicant received a letter from the creditor that contained an itemized statement of \ncharges for the 2017 delivery of her son. The creditor combined Applicant\u2019s two debts \nand the total remaining balance owed by Applicant, after insurance payments, is $2,331. \nThe other SOR debts listed in the divorce decree are the $4,122 credit-card debt \nowed to a home-improvement store for the purchase of a lawnmower (\u00b6 1.a); the $407 \ncredit-card debt owed to a department store (\u00b6 1.b); and the $777 credit-card debt owed \nto a furniture store for the purchase of a couch (\u00b6 1.c). None of the other six debts \ndelineated in the divorce decree have ever become delinquent. (GX 7; GX 5; GX 6; \nResponse.) \nIn her response to the FORM, Applicant stated: \nThe divorce awarded debts in excess of what I could pay off immediately. I \nhave contacted the collection agencies requesting itemized details and \nhave received only those for the medical debt related to my son\u2019s 2017 birth. \nI have a two-year plan I am working through to resolve the outstanding \ndebts including in the SOR. I prioritized debt to the government and current \ndebt pay-off over collection debt.

She understands that she is responsible for repaying her debts and considers \nresolving them a priority. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 4; Response.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes three disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues primarily arose between 2017 and 2019 when her \nhusband\u2019s income was not reliable and from unanticipated medical expenses related to \nher son\u2019s 2017 birth. These combined circumstances caused Applicant to be unable to \nmaintain payments on the three credit-card accounts and the four medical debts alleged \nin the SOR. Additionally, without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, her husband failed to file their \n2019 federal tax return.  \nWhen Applicant and her husband began divorce proceedings in May 2021, all of \ntheir marital assets were frozen. Applicant had the increased financial obligation of being \nprimarily responsible for her two minor children. When Applicant\u2019s final divorce decree \nwas entered in July 2022, the decree allocated 10 of the marital debts to Applicant \npersonally. With her increased financial obligations and no access to any of her marital \nassets, she did not have the financial resources to resolve the SOR debts. Additionally, \nApplicant was informed by the IRS that she owed approximately $9,600 for her 2021 \ntaxes. \nHowever, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. Despite her \nhusband\u2019s fluctuating income and her significant medical bills, Applicant maintained the \nmajority of her monthly financial obligations including her mortgage loan, her vehicle \nloans, and numerous credit cards. Although her marital assets were frozen after filing for \ndivorce in May 2021, and she had the increased financial obligation of primary support \nfor her two children, she continued to maintain her ongoing monthly financial obligations \nand did not did not incur any additional delinquent debt. After her divorce was finalized in \nJuly 2022 and she was assigned 10 of the marital debts, Applicant prioritized how she \nwould repay or otherwise resolve the debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter learning of the additional amount of taxes due for 2021 in June 2022, \nApplicant immediately contacted the IRS and entered a repayment plan. She made her \nfirst payment under the plan in July 2022 before the SOR was issued. She fully satisfied \nthe tax debt in December 2022. Resolving her tax debt was Applicant\u2019s first priority. \nThroughout their marriage, Applicant\u2019s husband was responsible for filing their tax \nreturns. However, unbeknownst to Applicant until much later, her husband failed to file \nthe 2019 federal-tax return. Despite her lack of experience with the process, Applicant \nfiled her 2019 federal-tax return in February 2023. \nApplicant has contacted each of the six creditors of the SOR debts. She requested \nstatements from each creditor itemizing the balances due. She received a letter from the \ncreditor of two of the medical debts that are owed as unanticipated expenses for the 2017 \nbirth of her son. Applicant accepts responsibility for each of her remaining SOR debts, \nwhich total $8,601, and is determined to repay or otherwise resolve each of them as she \nis able. \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that a person make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). While those granted \naccess to classified information are held to a high standard of conduct, they are not held \nto a standard of perfection. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant\u2019s financial habits are \nreckless or irresponsible or that she is likely to disregard her financial obligations in the \nfuture. She had executed repayment plan and begun paying the 2021 federal-tax debt \nalleged in the SOR, listed as $7,934, prior to the issuance of the SOR. She accepts \nresponsibility for her remaining delinquent accounts and has established a plan to resolve \nthem. She lives within her means and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. \nApplicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(e), and 20(g) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her past \nfinancial issues. Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with explanations, except for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which he denied. His explanations for the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d amount to denials, and I have considered them as such. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 26-year-old forklift operator employed by a defense contractor since June 2016. He has never married. He has served in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) since January 2016. His military job is culinary specialist. He received an Army Achievement Medal in March 2019. (AX H) He has held a security clearance since October 2015. (Tr. 5, 16; GX 10). He needs a security clearance to enter the shipyard for his civilian job. (Tr. 16) In 2014, while Applicant was in high school, one of his friends who was with him grabbed another person\u2019s laptop. Applicant and his friend ran away, but they were later detained and charged with felony larceny. Because Applicant was a juvenile, the felony charge was nolle prosequi, and he was placed on probation for six months and required to apologize and pay restitution. (Tr. 29-30) This incident was not alleged in the SOR. In 2015, while Applicant was still in high school, he was with a friend who started throwing rocks at a girl. Applicant testified that he did not throw any rocks, but he was charged with assault and battery and required to appear in court. In November 2015, the charge was dismissed on \u201crequest",

Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 12, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n19, 2023, and the case was assigned to me on June 30, 2023. On August 1, 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on August 31, 2023. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nD, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until September 22, \n2023, to enable him to submit additional evidence. He timely submitted AX E through AX \nI, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nSeptember 12, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations, except for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a, which he denied. His explanations \nfor the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d amount to denials, and I have considered \nthem as such. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old forklift operator employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2016. He has never married. He has served in the U.S. Army Reserve (USAR) since \nJanuary 2016. His military job is culinary specialist. He received an Army Achievement \nMedal in March 2019. (AX H) He has held a security clearance since October 2015. (Tr. \n5, 16; GX 10). He needs a security clearance to enter the shipyard for his civilian job. (Tr. \n16) \nIn 2014, while Applicant was in high school, one of his friends who was with him \ngrabbed another person\u2019s laptop. Applicant and his friend ran away, but they were later \ndetained and charged with felony larceny. Because Applicant was a juvenile, the felony \ncharge was nolle prosequi, and he was placed on probation for six months and required \nto apologize and pay restitution. (Tr. 29-30) This incident was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn 2015, while Applicant was still in high school, he was with a friend who started \nthrowing rocks at a girl. Applicant testified that he did not throw any rocks, but he was \ncharged with assault and battery and required to appear in court. In November 2015, the \ncharge was dismissed on \u201crequest of petitioner.\u201d (AX B) Applicant enlisted in the USAR \nin August 2015, but his active duty for basic training was delayed until the case was \nresolved. This incident was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn March 2017, while Applicant was on active duty, he attended a gun show and \nattempted to purchase a firearm. When he filled out the criminal consent form for his \nbackground check, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had ever been arrested \nfor a felony. He did not disclose his arrest for felony larceny in 2014. Based on this \nomission, he was charged with making a false statement on a firearm consent form. (GX \n5) In June 2018, the charge was dismissed. (GX 4 at 9) When Applicant was questioned \nby his platoon sergeant, he told him that he had misunderstood the question.

(Tr. 37) Applicant\u2019s USAR \ncommander was informed of the felony charge, Applicant\u2019s explanation, and the ultimate \ndismissal of the charges. His commander told the battalion security manager that he \nwanted to keep Applicant in the unit and wanted Applicant to keep his security clearance. \n(GX 10; AX A) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe admitted that he was charged with a felony, and he apologized for his negligence. \nIn September 2019, Applicant was charged with speeding 82 miles per hour (mph) \nin a 60-mph zone. The charge was amended to speeding 71 mph in a 60-mph zone, an \ninfraction. (GX 5 at 3) He pleaded guilty and was fined $66. This incident was not alleged \nin the SOR. \nIn October 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated \n(DWI) (1st  offense) and reckless driving. He was driving at night in the rain, and he ran off \nthe road and hit a light pole. He testified that he had not been drinking, but he failed a \nfield sobriety test because he could not recite the alphabet backwards. Two breathalyzer \ntests failed to detect alcohol. (Tr. 40-41) He went to trial, was represented by an attorney, \nand was found not guilty of both offenses. (GX 5 at 7) This arrest for DWI was alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, and Applicant admitted it in his answer. The charge of reckless driving was \nnot alleged in the SOR. \nIn July 2020, Applicant was charged with driving 44 mph in a 30-mph zone, an \ninfraction. Disposition was deferred and the charge was dismissed in December 2020 \n(GX 5 at 9) This charge was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn August 2020, Applicant was charged with assault and battery involving his \ngirlfriend at the time. They began arguing while they were in his car. When they got out \nof the car, the girlfriend threw a drink at him and tried to slap him. He went into the \ngirlfriend\u2019s house to retrieve his belongings, and when he stepped outside, his girlfriend \nsprayed him with pepper spray. He pushed her away with the palm of his hand and hit \nher nose, which began bleeding, and she fell to the ground. He then left the scene. After \nhe was served with a warrant, he filed an assault complaint against her. Both parties were \nrepresented by attorneys, and they mutually agreed to dismiss both complaints. (Tr. 48-\n51; GX 3 at 7) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and Applicant admitted being charged \nin his answer to the SOR. \nOn a later date in August 2020, Applicant was in a restaurant with a female friend. \nThey had agreed that each would pay their own bill, but his friend left without paying her \nbill. The restaurant owner demanded that Applicant pay both bills, but when he refused, \nthe restaurant owner called the police, who charged him with restaurant fraud. Applicant \ntestified that he would have paid the entire bill if he had enough money, but he was \u201cin a \ntough spot at the time.\u201d (Tr. 54) He eventually paid it. (Tr. 55) He went to court on October \n7, 2020, and was found not guilty. (GX 3 at 8; GX 4 at 10) This incident is alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, and Applicant admitted his arrest in his answer. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nIn April 2021, Applicant was charged with evasion of a traffic control device, \nreckless driving, and failure to obey a highway sign. The reckless driving charge was \nreduced to exercising improper control. He was convicted of improper control and failure \nto obey a highway sign. The charge of evading a traffic control device was dismissed. He \nwas fined $25 for each of the two other violations. (GX 5 at 11-15) He testified that he \nwas driving through a very congested and confusing construction zone, and he drove \naround one of the traffic barriers. (Tr. 56-57) This incident is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and \nApplicant admitted the arrest in his answer. SOR \u00b6 1.e is not fully established, because \nthe failure to obey a traffic sign is an infraction, not a criminal offense. The reckless \ndriving, reduced to exercising improper control, was not alleged. \nOn March 22, 2022, Applicant underwent a random urinalysis administered by his \nUSAR unit that tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). (GX 7) In a sworn \nstatement he provided to his company commander, he stated that he purchased an \nelectronic cigarette (vape) from a gas station. He stated that he specifically asked the \nstore clerk if the vape he purchased contained THC, and he was informed by the store \nclerk that it did not. The information from the store clerk was incorrect, and Applicant \ntested positive for THC. (GX 8 at 5) \nIn June 2023, Applicant voluntarily provided a urine sample to his civilian employer, \nand the results were negative for cocaine, marijuana, opiates, amphetamines, and \nphencyclidine. (AX E) He was screened for drug involvement and was found to have no \nalcohol or other drug problem. (AX D) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in July 2020 he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question \nasking if, in the past seven years, he had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to \nappear in court in a criminal proceeding against him; if he had been arrested by any police \nofficer, sheriff, marshal or other type of law enforcement official; and if he had been \ncharged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in any court. When he was interviewed by \na security investigator in October 2020, he told the investigator that he did not realize that \nhe had been charged with a felony for his involvement in the laptop theft in 2014. When \nthe investigator confronted him with his arrest record, he told the investigator that he did \nnot list his arrests in his SCA because he did not read the questions carefully. (GX 3 at \n7-8) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he did not disclose his arrest record in July \n2020 because he misread the question. \nApplicant submitted another SCA in May 2022, and he answered \u201cno\u201d to the same \nquestion about his arrest record. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he had \never been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs, and he did not disclose his \narrest for DUI in October 2019. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed that he misread the \nquestions. \nAfter Applicant was charged with falsifying the criminal consent form in March \n2017, his commander requested that he retain his security clearance and remain in the \nunit. (AX A) Applicant received the Army Achievement Medal in March 2019 for \nexceptional service.

(AX G) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s co-workers states that he is a skilled forklift operator and a very \ndiligent worker. His work ethic and dedication are noted and appreciated by all the \nemployees working with him. (AX F) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant made a false statement on a firearm consent form \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), was arrested and charged with DWI (SOR \u00b6 1.b), was arrested and charged \nwith assault and battery (SOR \u00b6 1.c), was arrested and charged with restaurant fraud \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), and arrested and charged with evasion of a traffic control device and failure \nto obey a highway sign (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is not established. Based on Applicant\u2019s age and the lenient treatment \nhe received for failing to disclose his juvenile arrest on the firearm consent form, I am not \nsatisfied that he knew he had been charged with a felony when he submitted the firearm \nconsent form. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is not established, because the only evidence of intoxication was \nApplicant\u2019s inability to recite the alphabet backwards. The breathalyzer did not detect \nalcohol. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is not established. The evidence showed that Applicant and his then \ngirlfriend had an affray initiated by her and he tried to push her away.

No disqualifying conditions are established under this \nguideline. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nJanuary 2022 to about March 2022, while granted access to classified information (SOR \n\u00b6 3.a, and that in March 2022 he tested positive for marijuana (SOR \u00b6 3.b) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline are: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(b): testing positive for an illegal drug; \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is not fully established. The evidence establishes only one instance of \nmarijuana involvement in January 2022. Even though Applicant held a security clearance, \nthere is no evidence that he had access to classified information. A security clearance \nalone does not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to gain access \nto specific classified materials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclearance), but also must have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to \nknow.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). \nSOR \u00b6 3.b is established by the evidence of Applicant\u2019s urinalysis that tested \npositive for THC. His urinalysis was conducted by his USAR unit. The 2019 edition of the \nManual for Courts-Martial (MCM) was applicable to his conduct. The MCM, Part IV, \u00b6 \n50.c.(5) provides that possession or use of a controlled substance is not wrongful (i.e., \nillegal) if it was without knowledge of the contraband nature of the substance. This \nrequirement of knowledge is also recognized in many civilian courts.  \nKnowledge of the contraband nature of the substance is not an element of AG \u00b6 \n25(b). Thus, I conclude that AG \u00b6 25(b) is established. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) \nare not established because the evidence shows that Applicant did not know that he was \nin possession of an illegal substance. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established because there is no \nevidence that Applicant had actual access to classified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 26(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d This mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s drug involvement was a \nsingle, isolated incident that gained his attention. He has a long record of arrests, but \nnone were for drug-related offenses. He did not know he had ingested THC until he \nreceived the urinalysis results. He realizes that any further drug involvement will cost him \nhis civilian and military jobs, and recurrence is unlikely. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b and 2.c allege falsification of an SCAs submitted in May 2022. SOR \u00b6 2.d alleges \nfalsification of an SCA submitted in July 2020. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying condition under this guideline is relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is not a neophyte regarding the security-clearance process. He \nsubmitted an SCA at some time after he enlisted in the USAR, and he received a security \nclearance. He completed another SCA in July 2020 in which he omitted information about \nhis arrest record. He was confronted with those omissions when he was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator in October 2020. Nevertheless, he omitted the same information \nwhen he submitted a third SCA in May 2022. His explanations for omitting the information \nabout his arrest record from his July 2020 SCA and May 2022 SCA are not credible \nThe fact that Applicant was not convicted of most of the offenses alleged in the \nSOR does not mitigate his falsification of the SCAs concerning the related arrests. An act \nof falsification has security significance independent of the underlying conduct. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-19278 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). The mitigation of the underlying \nconduct has little bearing on the security significance of the falsification, particularly where \nthere are multiple falsifications. ISCR Case No. 08-11944 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 15, 2011). \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct the omissions \nfrom his July 2020 until he was confronted with the evidence during his security interview \nin October 2020. Even after being confronted with his omissions, he made the same \nomissions in his May 2022 SCA. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications of his two SCAs are recent \nand serious offenses. Falsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart \nof the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those Guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the security \nconcerns under Guideline J and mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H, but \nhe has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement) \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

(GE 1,3) \nApplicant started having financial problems after experiencing what he described \nas \u2018job insecurity,\u2019 after being laid off in July 2020. Between July 2020 and October \n2021, he worked at four different security companies, with the jobs lasting between 2 \nand 8 months.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.i) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a ($488), one of the cell \nphone debts he admitted owing in the February 2022 subject interview. He admitted \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.j. All the debts appear on GE 4, a January 20, 2022 credit report. \nFor unknown reasons, only the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.g appear on GE \n5, an August 30, 2023 credit report. The most recent credit report, GE 6, dated April 4, \n2023, only reports the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of debt repayment. None of the alleged \ndebts are over seven years old. The alleged debts became delinquent between 2020 \nand 2022. There is no evidence that Applicant has challenged the information reported \non his credit reports as being inaccurate or erroneous. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Here, the SOR alleged and the record supports a \nfinding that Applicant is indebted to 10 creditors for $20,430. The Government has \nestablished its prima facie case that certain of the financial considerations apply, \nspecifically: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating condition is partially applicable, but does not fully mitigate the \nalleged concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe record contains sufficient evidence to establish that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems were caused by events beyond his control: job insecurity between July 2020 \nand October 2021; the death of his father; and the loss of household income due to an \nunexpected medical issue experienced by his cohabitant girlfriend. However, he did not \nsubmit evidence to satisfy the second part of the mitigation condition that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide any evidence that he has paid \nor successfully challenged the alleged debts. He also failed to provide evidence that he \nis no longer responsible for the debts either by cancellation by the creditors or \napplication of the statute of limitations. He did not present any evidence to show that his \nfinances are under control. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Although, security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection \nproceedings, an applicant is responsible for providing sufficient evidence to explain, \nrefute, or rebut the SOR allegations. Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production \nand persuasion. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On \nAugust 9, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F.

On June 7, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on July 12, 2023. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1, 3, and 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any \nother witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until July \n17, 2023, to enable him to submit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit (AX) A, which was admitted without objection.

The debts \nalleged in the SOR include two loans to a credit union, multiple credit-card and consumer \naccounts, and several medical debts. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.n and admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.o. His admission is \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old engineer technician employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 2017. He has held a second job as a delivery driver for a food service \nprovider since August 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 2004 \nto March 2012 and received an honorable discharge. He was unemployed from April 2012 \nto May 2013.

He held a security clearance while in the Navy, and he received a \nsecurity clearance for his current job in May 2018. \nApplicant married in August 2016 and has four stepchildren, ages 20, 18, 16, and \n14. Although the father of these four children provides occasional financial support for \nthem, Applicant and his wife are responsible for their daily living expenses.  \nApplicant and his wife purchased a home in February 2016, while he was working \nin a job that paid less than his current job. He and his wife began falling behind on their \ndebts and they began having a monthly deficit of about $1,000 per month. (Tr. 33, 37) \nAfter some point after Applicant and his wife purchased the home, they decided to \nhave a child. Applicant\u2019s wife became pregnant, but she miscarried at six months. They \ntried again, and their daughter was born in March 2018. (Tr. 18) His wife, who was earning \nabout $50,000 per year, stopped working after their daughter was born in March 2018, \nbecause the cost of childcare was about the same as what she was earning. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant testified that the minimum monthly payments on their debts kept increasing, \nand they knew it was only a matter of time before they would become delinquent.

(Tr. 51) They could not file their \nbankruptcy petition in 2018, because they could not afford to pay the legal fees. (Tr. 33-\n34) The petition reflects that the lawyer\u2019s fee was $2,600. (GX 4 at 60)  \nApplicant and his wife filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2022, \nmore than five years after consulting with the bankruptcy lawyer. Applicant testified that \nit took them a long time to save enough money to pay the bankruptcy lawyer because \n\u201cthat money would always kind of go to something else that would come up in the \nmoments that we would need to pay off during all that time, and it was a long time.\u201d The \npetition included the debts alleged in the SOR. They claimed their home, two vehicles, \nand various personal effects as exempt property. The petition listed Applicant\u2019s wife as \nthe sole owner of the home and two vehicles. (GX 4 at 20-22) They received a discharge \nin December 2022. (AX A) Applicant admitted that protecting his security clearance was \na major factor in his decision to file the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 47)  \nApplicant\u2019s current net remainder after paying all living expenses is about $1,000 \nper month. (Tr. 52) He and his wife drive two old cars that are paid for: an 18-year-old \nvehicle with 150,00 miles on it and a 16-year-old vehicle with 195,000 miles on it. (GX 3 \nat 11) They have only one credit card, and they pay more than the monthly minimum \namount. The payments on their home mortgage loan are current. (Tr. 49) Their monthly \nnet remainder after paying all their expenses is about $1,000 (Tr. 52) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admission and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts were frequent, recent, and did not \noccur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s decision to purchase a house that \nstrained their budget was not a reasonable course of action. When Applicant\u2019s wife \nbecame pregnant, it was not a condition largely beyond their control. It was not a surprise, \nbut rather a conscious decision. The record does not reflect whether the medical debts \nalleged in the SOR were due to conditions largely beyond their control. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ndecision to stop working was a reasonable alternative to the cost of childcare. However, \ndelaying the bankruptcy action for five years was an unreasonable and irresponsible \ncourse of action.  \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established.

A bankruptcy discharge is not a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d \nto resolve debts. See ISCR Case No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May 2, 2013). Furthermore, an \napplicant who waits until his or her clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may \nbe lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2017). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. I have considered that he served honorably and held a security clearance in the \nU.S. Navy for eight years. However, insufficient time has passed since his bankruptcy \ndischarge to convince me that his financial problems will not recur. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his history of delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph F (Financial Considerations):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

(GX 1, 3; AX G; FORM Response) \nIn January 2020, shortly after submitting his SCA, Applicant contacted a debt \nconsolidation company to assist him in addressing his delinquent accounts. He also \nsubmitted a Loan Rehabilitation form to the Department of Education (DOE) to bring his \nstudent loans current. However, before he began making payments on either plan, his \nwife\u2019s employment was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially, she received a \nreduced work schedule. Within a few months, she lost her job. Applicant abandoned the \ndebt consolidation plan when he realized he would be unable to make the proposed \nmonthly payment.

In November and \nDecember 2022, he settled the debts reflected in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, 1.g and 1.h. He \nrecently signed up for an online budgeting service that includes credit monitoring and \ndebt payoff goals. (AX B-F, J, M, N; FORM Response) \nIn January 2023, Applicant enrolled in an online personal finance course. He \nasserted that since he incurred the delinquent debts referenced in the SOR, he has \nmaintained on-time payments on his other accounts and has not experienced any new \ndelinquent debts. (AX O, FORM Response) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($17,247) and 1.c ($4,205) are Applicant\u2019s federal student loans. \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s January 2020 submission of the DOE Loan Rehabilitation form, \npayments on federal student loans were paused as part of the March 2020 Coronavirus \nAid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The pause included several relief \nmeasures for eligible loans such as a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; \nand suspension of collection efforts on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) \nwebsite, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/.

Litigation regarding the constitutionality of this \nplan followed, and a decision by the Supreme Court remains pending as of this writing. \nIn December 2022, the DOE emailed Applicant and stated that the pause on the \npayment of student loans would extend through at least June 2023 and that he would \nbe notified directly when payments were scheduled to restart. (AX A) \nEven though payments on federal student loans remain paused by the federal \ngovernment, in February 2023, Applicant submitted a request that his loans be \nprocessed through the DOE Fresh Start Initiative and that an income-driven repayment \nplan be initiated. He explained that he submitted this application in the event he did not \nqualify for forgiveness of his student loans by DOE. He has budgeted enough money to \nresume student loan payments when notified by the DOE. (AX L; FORM Response) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($5,110), 1.g ($879) and 1.i ($776) are delinquent credit card \naccounts that were either charged off or placed in collection.

(AX D, F; FORM Response) \nApplicant began addressing his recent delinquent accounts in 2020, but \nacknowledged that receipt of the SOR \u201cexpedited\u201d his efforts. He asserted that, over the \nlast twenty years, he has either held a security clearance or undergone successful \nbackground investigations. Over that time, he has not had any disciplinary or security \nviolations. (FORM Response) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes two conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19 and are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBeginning in 2018, Applicant experienced significant financial difficulties. The \ndelinquent debts in the SOR, including federal student loans, multiple credit cards, a \npersonal loan and multiple cellphone and cable bills, are established by Applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadmissions and the credit reports in the record. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. \n905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013) \nThe Appeal Board has also stated that a security clearance adjudication is not a \ndebt-collection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. \n21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of \nevery debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the \nfinancial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no \nrequirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nThere are four pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2018, fearing the end of his employment contract, Applicant changed jobs and \ntook a salary reduction that caused financial stress. In January 2020, he attempted to \nrecover from those circumstances by contacting a debt consolidation company and \nsubmitting a DOE Loan Rehabilitation form to bring his student loans into good \nstanding. However, those efforts were hindered when his wife lost her job because of \nCOVID-19 related shutdowns. These events were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. \nStill, by the end of 2020, Applicant began addressing his delinquent debts. He \nhas since settled and paid five of his accounts. He has also made efforts to address his \nfederal student loans. Although he remains hopeful for some form of federal student \nloan forgiveness, he also submitted a DOE application to initiate an income-driven \nrepayment plan once the pause on student loans is lifted. Applicant sold his truck to \nmaintain sufficient funds to initiate payments on his student loans once applicable. He \nalso recently signed up for an online budgeting service that includes credit monitoring \nand debt payoff goals. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur, and they no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. He has issued payment on multiple debts and \nestablished a plan to address the remaining delinquencies. Additionally, he is prepared \nto issue payments on his student loans once directed to by DOE. Applicant has \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-payment. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d) also apply.  \nApplicant recently signed up for an online budgeting service that included credit \nmonitoring and debt payoff goals. He also enrolled in an online personal finance course. \nHe has a responsible plan in place for when he is required to address his federal \nstudent loans. AG \u00b6 20(c) is also applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has been consistently employed over the last twenty years and \npreviously held security clearances without incident. Beginning in 2018, fearing for his \njob, he took a new position that came with significant wage loss. In 2020, he began to \naddress his delinquent debts. However, he soon faced additional financial stresses with \nhis wife\u2019s job loss following COVID-19 related shutdowns. \nSince then, Applicant has paid and resolved several of his delinquent debts and \nestablished a plan to pay the remainder. He has submitted applications with DOE for \neither loan rehabilitation or the initiation of an income-driven repayment plan. He has \nbudgeted money to pay his student loans once directed by DOE. \nWhen compared to his long career, Applicant has shown that his recent financial \nconcerns are an anomaly. In review of the record evidence as a whole, I find that he has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant's eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. 32-34) However, his SCA reflects that their \nmarriage was \u201cdivorced/dissolved\u201d in July 2020. (GX 1 at 29) \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling about $43,179. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from August 2022 (GX 4), January 2022 (GX 5), and August \n2023 (GX 6). Applicant was interviewed about his debts by a security investigator on \nFebruary 4 and February 11, 2022 (GX 2). The evidence concerning the debts alleged in \nthe SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.h, and 1.k: student loans totaling $34,526. During Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity interviews in February 2022, he told the investigator that the loans were in \nforbearance while he was on active duty and that he made some payments when they \nwere due and then tried for another forbearance. He told the investigator that he had not \nthought about the loans for a while. (GX 2 at 5) In his answer to the SOR, he provided \ndocumentation that he had applied for consolidation of his loans into an income-\ncontingent repayment plan on November 28, 2022. He stated that the consolidation would \nbe effective on December 5, 2022, but he provided no documentation showing that his \napplication was approved. As of the date the record closed, he had made no payments \nunder the plan because of the COVID-19 forbearance. (Tr. 57) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: student loan for $3,695.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit\ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant has encountered several conditions \nlargely beyond his control: a marital separation, a short period of unemployment after his \ndischarge from the Air Force, and uninsured medical expenses. However, he has not \nacted responsibly. He accumulated delinquent debts because of inattention and poor \nrecord keeping. He did not begin to seriously address his delinquent debts until he \nrealized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant employed a debt-resolution service, but \nhe has not received the type of financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating \ncondition, and his financial situation is not yet under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted evidence that the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.o has been paid in full, but he did not resolve it until he received the SOR and realized \nthat his security clearance was in jeopardy.

Applicant testified that he disputed the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.n, but he submitted no documentation of the basis for the dispute or its status. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(GE 2-7; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began after her student loan deferments ended in \n2014 shortly after she finished attending classes for her master\u2019s program. During this \ntime, she was either working low-paying hourly jobs or she was unemployed. She did not \nstart making an annual salary until starting with her current employer in 2018. She initially \nearned a yearly salary of $90,000 and is now making approximately $110,000. (Tr. 19-21 \nApplicant took out both private student loans and federally funded student loans to \nfinance both her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s programs. Her federal student loans have a \ncurrent balance of approximately $108,000, and are not at issue here. Those loans are \ncurrently in a deferred status from COVID-19 relief executive orders. (See: \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-\nstudent-loan-payments/) She claimed she made $300-$400 per month payments on her \nfederal student loans before the COVID-19 deferments. She did not provide \ndocumentation supporting her assertion. (Tr. 51-54) \nAs stated above, Applicant provides financial support for her mother (age 70) and \nher father (age 90). They live in a different state than does Applicant. She is the only \nfamily member in a position to help her parents. She started helping them financially in \napproximately 2019, and since February 2020, she has done so on a consistent monthly \nbasis. She estimates she provides between $400-$800 monthly. Her mother has direct \naccess to Applicant\u2019s bank account and will transfer or take out money when necessary. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nShe always informs Applicant when she does so. Between her own monthly living \nexpenses and what she provides her parents, she claims she did not make enough to \npay her private student loans. She looked into the possibility of hiring two debt-relief \ncompanies, but she could not afford the monthly payments each calculated for her, and \nso she declined to hire them. She admitted that she put her private student-loan \nobligations on the \u201cback burner,\u201d in terms of her financial priorities. She provided a \nmonthly budget that shows a $1,200 monthly surplus after all expenses. She also \nprovided a copy of an earnings statement. The budget does not account for any payments \nto either her private or her federal student loans. (Tr. 21-22, 31-32, 51, 56; GE 3) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 (Student Loans) 1.a-$22,105; 1.b-$20,160; 1.c-$19,368; 1.d-$17,312;\n1.e-$11,493. Applicant admitted these delinquent student loans. All five were originally \nassigned for collection between May 2006 and August 2008, and a more recent credit \nreport shows major delinquencies for all accounts between June and December 2019. \nRecently, they were bought by a collection agency, which approached Applicant with \nsettlement offers for all five loans in July 2022. Applicant admitted receiving the offers \nand provided copies of them. The offers expired in August 2022 without Applicant \ncommitting to them. She stated paying her student loans was not a priority in her life right \nnow. She has not entered into an agreement with the collector holding her private student \nloans since then. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 22, 29, 35, 57; GE 2-7; SOR answer; \nAE A1-A5)\n \nApplicant provided a character letter written on her behalf by a coworker who \nstated that Applicant is a great asset to their work team. She also opined that Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment make her worthy of holding a security \nclearance. (AE B) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s five charged-off private student loans were first assigned for collection \nback between 2006 and 2008 and are now charged off. She admitted not making \npayments on these loans either because she could not afford to at the time, or because \nthey were a low priority to her. Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports establish the \ndebts. I find all the disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. She has made no efforts, \naccording to the evidence, to address these five delinquent student loans. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable. \nApplicant presented evidence that the debts were affected by circumstances \nbeyond her control, namely, her unemployment and underemployment, and the need to \nprovide financial support to her elderly parents. However, she did not act responsibly \nconcerning the debts, because she failed to resolve them in a timely fashion. Additionally, \nin July 2022, when given an opportunity to settle the debts at a much reduced rate, she \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndeclined to act on the offer. AG \u00b6 20(b), therefore, has some application, but does not \nfully apply. \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. Her track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Based upon her past history and the \napproximately $100,000-worth of federal student loans that are currently deferred, there \nis no reason to believe that she will right her financial ship in the future, because she \npresented no viable plan to do so. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor service, her underemployment and \nunemployment, and the financial support she provides to her parents. However, I also \nconsidered that she has not adequately addressed her delinquent student loans. She has \nnot established a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to \nquestion her ability to resolve her debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. at 24; AE \n1, 4-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unfiled tax returns, unpaid \ntaxes, and a charged-off credit card account. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) are applicable. \nThe $53 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) has been paid and has no security \nsignificance. SOR \u00b6 1.d is resolved for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant assumed that his wife was handling their taxes. He thought if the IRS \nhad any issues they would contact him, and he did not receive anything from the IRS. \nThat is irresponsible conduct. Additionally, he knew he owed the IRS for at least tax \nyear 2014 because he discussed it in his SF 86. He again ignored his tax obligations. \nHe retained a tax company in August 2022 to file his back returns and to represent him \nbefore the IRS for the taxes owed. All his federal tax returns have been filed, except for \ntax year 2016. His tax service wrote: \u201cThe IRS requires the past 6 years to be filed in \norder to be in compliance with IRS tax filing requirements and to be in good standing \nwith the IRS; therefore, we are not filing [Applicant\u2019s] 2016 federal tax return.\u201d He still \nowes the IRS more than $140,000 for tax years 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020, which does not include all the penalties and interest and what he would have \nowed, if anything, for 2016. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to the filed tax returns. It does not apply to the unpaid \ntaxes and the unfiled 2016 tax return. Little mitigation is provided in security clearance \ncases when an applicant stands on a legal defense such as the statute of limitations. \nSee e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01231 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015). \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the returns are eventually filed, and the taxes \npaid. \nApplicant\u2019s tax company is attempting to work out a payment plan with the IRS. \nHe stated that he will pay whatever he owes. However, intentions to resolve financial \nproblems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other \nresponsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the $20,271 charged-off credit card debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), but he provided no documentation in support of a dispute. The debt is \nlisted on all six credit reports in evidence, including the most recent one submitted by \nApplicant. I believe the most likely scenario is Applicant opened the account in 2008, \ngave the card to his wife, and then disregarded the card, the same way he ignored his \ntaxes. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable to that debt. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. His financial issues are recent and ongoing, and \ncontinue to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules \nand regulations. The mitigation provided by the filed returns is insufficient to overcome \nthe years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to file his tax returns and pay his taxes \nwhen they were due. None of the above mitigating conditions are sufficient to mitigate \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered that Applicant \nhas worked in important roles supporting the U.S. military for more than 30 years, and \nhis performance evaluations reflect excellent job performance. However, he shirked a \nfundamental requirement to file his tax returns and pay his taxes when they were due. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except tax \nyear 2021, which is found for \nApplicant) \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Item 7) \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from February and August 2022, the SOR \nalleged eight debts totaling about $57,157, which became delinquent between 2017 and \n2020. (Items 4, 5) The status of those debts is as follows: \n1. In 2022, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a. filed a lawsuit against Applicant for $22,443. \nOn November 23, 2022, Applicant entered into an agreement to settle the debt for \n$11,000. He made an $8,000 payment to the creditor before December 22, 2022, and \nagreed to make 12 monthly payments of $250 thereafter. He stated the balance was \n$2,500 as of February 2023. (AE A) It is being resolved. \n2. The $7,857 charged-off credit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is unresolved. \n3. The $6,021 charged-off credit card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is unresolved. \nApplicant said he is addressing this debt now because he resolved the lawsuit. (AE A) \n4.

(Item \n2) \nTo date, Applicant has resolved $5,676 of the alleged debt, and he is resolving \n$22,443 of debt. Approximately, $29,000 of alleged debt remains unresolved. \nApplicant told the government investigator during his March 2022 interview that \nhis current income was $95,000 a year, and his wife earned about $25,000 a year. He \nsaid after he pays his expenses, he has $800 to $1,000 remaining each month, which he \nwas saving to resolve his debts. He said his employer and security officer are aware of \nhis financial problems. (Item 7) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s January 2023 CBR, he has 13 student loans, which he \nopened between 2005 and 2008. As of January 2023, the balance owed is around \n$104,000. He pays about $270 a month on that balance. The loans are reported as \n\u2018current\u2019 or \u2018pays as agreed\u2019.1 (Items 4, 6) \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \n1In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Education (DoEd) \nplaced all federal student loans in forbearance and has since extended the student loan payment \npause through June 30, 2023. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a \nsuspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collection on defaulted loans.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of several \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline lists conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nTwo are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant accumulated $57,157 of SOR-alleged delinquent debts between 2017 \nand 2020, most of which he has been unable to fully resolve. The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. Four are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR-alleged debts started becoming delinquent in 2018 when his \nstart-up business venture in cryptocurrency began to fail. His debts were substantial, \ncontinue into the present, and cast ongoing doubt on his judgment. The evidence \nestablishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nWhile the financial market downturn affecting cryptocurrency may have been a \ncircumstance beyond Applicant\u2019s control, his reliance on credit cards and personal loans \nto finance his speculative venture was within his control. He did not present evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances until sometime in April 2022, when he paid \none debt after he spoke to the government investigator about his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. Applicant has not participated in credit or budget counseling. In April \n2022, he resolved and paid the $5,676 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. In November 2022, he \nreached a settlement in a lawsuit and began resolving the $22,443 debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.a. He said he is trying to resolve the $6,021 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. While there is \nsome evidence indicating that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are slowly coming under \ncontrol, that evidence is insufficient to establish significant mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). \nApplicant established minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) for the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e. He did not initiate a good-faith effort to resolve the $22,443 debt until \nafter the creditor sued him. He did not begin to address the $5,676 until after he spoke to \nthe investigator. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n                      \n \n  \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult who \nis accountable for his choices and actions. In 2017, he started a financially risky venture \nusing borrowed funds that resulted in significant losses and delinquent debt within a year. \nWhile he asserts that he is reliable and trustworthy, his failure to begin demonstrating \nresponsible management until after he submitted his January 2022 SCA makes this claim \nless persuasive. He knew he was acquiring delinquent debts when his business failed but \nwaited almost four years to begin to address them. He did not submit a written budget \nwith sufficient details about his income and monthly expenses for me to determine his \nfinancial solvency and ability to pay his ongoing debts. He has managed to stay current \non $100,000 of outstanding student loan debt through the government pause and minimal \npayments. However, this pending additional debt load, together with the remaining debts \nalleged in the SOR, create some uncertainty about his ability to achieve and maintain \nfinancial stability and reliability. The likelihood of continuation and recurrence of financial \nconcerns, and the potential for pressure and duress, remain undiminished at present. \nApplicant has not established a reliable track record of responsibly handling his \nfinancial obligations. Overall, the record evidence does not resolve the concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He did not meet his burden \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________ \nConclusion \nConsidering all circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nNational security eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF), formerly known as the Department of Defense (DOD) CAF, issued her a \nset of interrogatories. She responded to those interrogatories on March 7, 2022. On \nOctober 24, 2022, the DCSA CAF, now renamed the DCSA Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (DOD CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order \n(Exec.

A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on April 28, 2023, and she was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudication Guidelines applicable to her case. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on May 8, 2023. Her response was due on June 7, 2023. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of June 21, 2023, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on August 1, 2023, and there was still no \nresponse to the FORM. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, both SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.b.), and she submitted \nan eviction letter from a law firm representing one of her creditors. \nBackground \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

(Item 3 at 44) \nThe SOR alleged two still-delinquent accounts, including the bank card, as set \nforth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a bank card account with an $800 credit limit that was \ndelinquent in the amount of $1,183 and charged off. Applicant\u2019s last payment was made \nin April 2019. (Item 7 at 2; Item 6 at 3; Item 5 at 3) In her March 2022 Response to the \nInterrogatories, she admitted that she had made no payment arrangements and was not \nmaking payments. (Item 4 at 2) In her January 2023 Answer to the SOR, she indicated \nthat the account \u201cwill be paid off after February\u201d after she files her income tax and receives \nher tax refund. (Item 2 at 5) She offered no explanations as to how the financial situation \noccurred or deteriorated, why she failed to address the situation since 2019, and \nsubmitted no documentation to indicate that the account has been paid as promised. As \nof the date of this decision, she has furnished no evidence to indicate that any positive \nactions have been taken by her. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. refers to a home mortgage account opened in December 2018 in the \ninitial amount of $178,730 for which no payments were made since July 2021. (Item 7 at \n2; Item 6 at 4; Item 5 at 4) A foreclosure sheriff\u2019s sale was conducted in May 2022, and \nthe redemption period expired without redemption. On December 15, 2022, attorneys \nrepresenting the lender gave Applicant a notice of eviction asking that she vacate and \nremove all her personal possessions from the property, or the sheriff would evict her. \n(Letter attached to Answer) Although the cited credit reports all indicate the unpaid \nbalance was $178,730, and the interrogatories state that the account was past due \n$17,660 and the total loan was $193,596, the SOR alleges that the account was past due \nin the amount of $30,028, and that there was a total loan balance of $202,468. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s only citation source for the alleged past-due amount is the SOR \nitself. Regardless of the amounts in dispute, a foreclosure did occur with anticipated \neviction. In the absence of any positive evidence by Applicant, I conclude that the account \nhas not been resolved. \nAs of March 7, 2022, according to a Personal Financial Statement, Applicant \nreported a monthly net income of $2,155.36; monthly expenses of $3,500; and an unpaid \nmortgage of $27,000. Considering those numbers and her negative balance, she had no \nmonthly remainder available for savings or spending. (Personal Financial Statement \nattached to Response to Interrogatories) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority \nto control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n3 \n\n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d   \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus \ncan be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such \nas excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is \nat greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent debts: a bank card and a mortgage foreclosure. \nApplicant acknowledged the delinquent bank card in her SF 86; acknowledged that she \nhad taken no positive resolution actions regarding the accounts in her Responses to the \nInterrogatories; and subsequently admitted both allegations. Based on those facts, as \nwell as the information in her Personal Financial Statement, it is clear that AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand (c) have been established. There is no evidence to indicate an unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) is not established. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant offered no explanations \nregarding the cause of her financial difficulties; did not dispute the legitimacy of the debts; \ndid not indicate any ongoing contacts with her creditors or any efforts to resolve the \ndelinquent accounts; clearly stated that she had made no payments on the accounts; and \nmerely indicated that she would resolve the smaller account after February after her \nincome taxes would be filed. The record is silent regarding that promised action. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nBased on the evidence, it appears that Applicant ignored her delinquent accounts \nfor a substantial multi-year period. Because of her failure to furnish any explanations \nregarding her delinquent debts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that \nher financial problems are not under control or that she is not truly interested in resolving \nthem. Her inaction indicates that she has not acted responsibly. The Appeal Board has \npreviously commented on such a situation: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with \nthose financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained \ncontact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has failed to furnish any verifiable evidence that she began \nmaking such efforts before the SOR was issued in October 2022, or even since that \nperiod. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered a generalized \nstatement regarding a future payment for only one account but failed to offer any \ndocumentation to verify the promised action.  \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a \nshowing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. There is clear evidence that Applicant \nhas no monthly remainder available for savings or spending. Applicant\u2019s relative in-action, \nunder the circumstances, casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving as a \nfinial inspector since November 2014. She was previously employed by other employers \nas an operator; in assembly; and inspector. She was unemployed for approximately six \nmonths in 2012. She is a 2002 high school graduate.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. There is a bank card account with an $800 credit limit that \nwas delinquent in the amount of $1,183 and charged off. Her last payment was made in \nApril 2019. In her March 2022 Response to the Interrogatories, she admitted that she had \nmade no payment arrangements and was not making payments. In her January 2023 \nAnswer to the SOR, she indicated that the account \u201cwill be paid off after February\u201d after \nshe files her income tax and receives her tax refund. She subsequently offered no \nevidence that she had ever made the payment. There is also a home mortgage account \nopened in December 2018 in the initial amount of $178,730 for which no payments were \nmade since July 2021. A foreclosure sheriff\u2019s sale was conducted in May 2022, and the \nredemption period expired without redemption. In December 2022, she was issued a \nnotice of eviction asking that she vacate and remove all her personal possessions from \nthe property, or the sheriff would evict her. Applicant offered no explanations as to how \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe financial situation occurred or deteriorated, why she failed to address the situation \nsince 2019. As of the date of this decision, she has furnished no evidence to indicate that \nany positive actions had been taken by her. Applicant\u2019s inaction generates lingering \nquestions if she is currently in a better position financially than she had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or her] \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan \nfor the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on \nall outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. \nLikewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve her financial issues is \nnegative and disappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom her financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 2 at 4.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant's admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant's delinquent debts occurred under \nsuch circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. She listed various life events in her \nAnswer. She acknowledged she has been focused on current debts and not her older \ndebts. Her response to the interrogatories shows that her financial problems are not being \nresolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant cited unexpected medical \nemergencies to both her and her daughter; the death of her father; rendering financial \nassistance to her mother; and expenses incurred for her pet. She provided some \nevidence that she addressed three uncharged debts in her response to interrogatories. \nShe does not support her claim that she acted responsibly under the circumstances, \neither through payment or with legal action, with regard to the majority of her debts. Where \nshe stated she had acted or intended to act there is limited evidence of action on her part. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are partially established. Applicant engaged a debt \nconsolidation company and then withdrew from the agreement over a dispute. She stated \nshe does not want to enter into agreements \u201cwith the past companies\u201d without knowing if \nshe would retain her clearance. (Item 2 at 4.) She has not shown that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. She acknowledged she pushed her older debts aside.

See ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
