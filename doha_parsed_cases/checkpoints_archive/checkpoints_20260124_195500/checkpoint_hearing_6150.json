Veilleux, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline K (Handling Protected\nInformation), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline B (Foreign Influence)  of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn March 31, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable finding under subparagraph 2(b), Guideline E, is not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\nsupported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in her evidentiary rulings; whether\nthe Judge failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a researcher,\ninvestigator, and program manager for a government contractor.  He holds a Ph.D. in engineering.\nIn the mid-1990s, Applicant met a woman, whom the Judge identified as \u201cZ,\u201d a citizen of Russia,\nwho resided in a third country and was employed as a member of a university faculty.  In early 2005,\nApplicant and Z began a romantic relationship.  He made three personal trips to the third country to\nvisit Z.  \nIn April 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer briefed him on his duty to report foreign contacts, due\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility for special access.  This briefing informed Applicant that he \u201cmust report\nall close and continuing relationships with foreign nationals.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Although advised of\nthis requirement, Applicant did not report his relationship with Z until November 2005.  During their\nrelationship, Applicant informed Z that he had access to classified information.  In 2006 Applicant\nand Z married.  \nZ is a dual citizen of Russia and the third country, as are her two daughters.  She received her\neducation in Russia.  Her father and mother are residents and citizens of Russia.  Both receive\ngovernment pensions.  Z also has a half-sister who is a citizen and resident of Russia.  Z speaks with\nher parents weekly and with her sister approximately once every six months.  She sends money to\nher parents on a monthly basis.  \nAt least since 1997, Russia has targeted U.S. technologies and has sought to obtain protected\ninformation through industrial espionage. The Russian Federal Security Service operates outside\nRussia by targeting national security and environmental researchers.  The Russian government\nconducts electronics surveillance, including the monitoring of internet and e-mail traffic.   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material findings are based\non substantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  See  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d)  Applicant states that the Judge erred in concluding that he had\nintentionally failed to report his contacts with Z.  The Board notes the testimony of the security\nofficer for Applicant\u2019s employer.  This person stated that she had briefed Applicant of his reporting\nrequirements in April 2005, several months before he complied.  Tr. at 38-41.  This witness\u2019s\ntestimony, along with other record evidence, e.g., Applicant\u2019s prior compliance with foreign contact\nreporting requirements (Tr. at 138), support a conclusion that his failure to report his relationship\nwith Z was knowing and willful.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion, therefore, is sustainable.  In support of\nhis appeal, Applicant points to decisions by the Hearing Office, which he argues support his request\nfor a favorable determination.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  However, each\ncase \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Moreover, Hearing Office\n\ndecisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No.\n06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  The Board finds no basis to disturb the Judge\u2019s evidentiary\nrulings.  See ISCR Case No. 03-08813 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2005) (The Board will examine a\nJudge\u2019s evidentiary rulings to determine if they are consistent with Executive Order 10865 and with\nthe Directive and to determine if they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.).   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person\nfactors.

Fusco, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under the \nHandling Protected Information, Personal Conduct, and Foreign Influence adjudicative \nguidelines.  His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 1, 2005, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-Qip). On May 22, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline B, Foreign Influence. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was not dated. He requested a hearing before a \nDOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 16, 2008. With \nthe consent of the parties, I scheduled hearings for January 28, 2009 and February 6, \n2009. The hearing was continued on those dates for inclement weather and the \nunavailability of a government witness. I reconvened the hearing on February 20, 2009.  \nAt that time, Applicant introduced five exhibits (Ex.), which were marked as Applicant\u2019s \nEx. A through E and admitted to the record without objection. At the February 20, 2009, \nhearing, the parties agreed to another continuance to enable a witness, previously ill \nand unavailable, to testify for the government.  \n \nOn March 4, 2009, I reconvened the hearing to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called one witness, introduced twelve exhibits (Ex. 1 \nthrough 12), and offered facts found in eight official documents of the U.S. Government \nfor administrative notice. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.)  The Government\u2019s exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. I took notice of HE 1.  Applicant testified on this own behalf \nand called two witnesses. He introduced two additional exhibits, which were marked as \nEx. F and G and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr. 1) of the February 20, 2009 hearing on March 2, 2009. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr. 2) of the March 4, 2009 hearing on March 13, 2009.    \n                                          \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains one allegation of disqualifying conduct under AG K, Handling \nProtected Information (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), two allegations of disqualifying information under \nAG E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.), and five AG allegations under AG B, \nForeign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. through 3.e.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted the Guideline K and E allegations but denied they were disqualifying conduct \nunder the guidelines. He admitted the five Guideline B allegations. In response to all \nallegations, he provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as \nfindings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and the applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and a Ph.D. electrical engineer. He is employed as a \nprincipal investigator, researcher, and program manager by a government contractor. \nHe holds several patents. Applicant\u2019s employer considers his contribution to his field to \nbe unique and of  high importance internationally.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 2, 99-102, 115.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States and received his undergraduate and \ngraduate degrees from U.S. institutions. He earned his Ph.D. in 1997. He has been \nemployed by his current employer or its predecessor since 1997. (Ex. 1.) \n \n \nApplicant was first granted special access security clearance eligibility by his \nemployer in about 2000. During the time he held the special access eligibility, between \n2000 and 2004, he complied with the foreign contact reporting requirement and reported \nhis relationship with some of his foreign contacts from Asia. Applicant maintained \nspecial access eligibility until he transferred to another sector of the company in 2004.  \nHe was read-out of the special access program before he transferred to the new sector. \nWhen he assumed his duties at the new sector in November 2004, he was awarded a \nsecret level security clearance. In about February 2005, he prepared the forms \nnecessary to be inducted into the new sector\u2019s special access program. In April of 2005, \nafter a security indoctrination briefing, he was again granted eligibility for special \naccess.  (Tr. 2 at  38-41, 115-118, 137-140.) \n \n \nIn the briefing he received in April 2005 at the time he was awarded eligibility for \nspecial access, Applicant\u2019s employer provided him with a document entitled \u201cSecurity \nEducation and Awareness Training.\u201d In that document, employees holding special \naccess eligibility were advised to report changes in marital status, to inform the \nemployer of cohabitation, particularly if the partner was a foreign national, and to \nrequest clearance for travel to hazardous countries. The training document stated: \n\u201cSCI/SAP [Special Access Program] cleared individuals must report all close and \ncontinuing relationships with foreign nationals.\u201d Applicant raised no questions or \nconcerns at the briefing. (Ex. 2; Tr. 2 at 37-41 .) \n \n \nIn 1995, while he was a graduate student, Applicant married a U.S. citizen, who \nearned a Ph.D. in Physics. Two daughters were born to the marriage. The children are \nnow ages nine and six. Applicant\u2019s wife worked in the same area of specialization as he \ndid. She was employed by the same employer as Applicant, and she and Applicant \nworked in the same building. She also holds a security clearance.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 2, 177-\n179.) \n \n \nIn 1996, while still in graduate school, Applicant met a woman, a citizen of \nRussia, who was also pursuing graduate studies in his area of specialty. Later, he saw \nthe woman at work sessions at his company and at professional meetings. The Russian \nwoman, hereafter identified as \u201cZ,\u201d was employed as a professor at a university in \nSweden. She was married to a Russian citizen, and she resided in Sweden with her \nhusband and their two children.  (Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Ex. 7; Ex. 9.) \n \n \nIn February 2005, Applicant and Z attended a professional conference and \nbegan a romantic relationship. He traveled to Sweden to visit Z in March, October, and \nNovember 2005. He did not tell his wife of the affair until sometime in September 2005. \nHe did not inform his security officer of the relationship or of his three personal trips to \nvisit Z in Sweden until November 2005. Applicant\u2019s employer suspended his security \nclearance in November 2005. When he completed his e-QIP in December 2005, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant listed Z as his associate and stated he planned to begin living with her in a \nspouse-like relationship in early 2006. He claimed he did not comply with security \nrequirements for reporting the relationship or his foreign travel to visit Z because he was \nconfused about special access program reporting requirements. Applicant\u2019s claims of \nconfusion were not credible.  (Ex. 1; Ex. 3; Ex. 4; Ex. 6; Tr. 2 at 41-44.)    \n \n \nAt some time during their relationship, Applicant told Z that he had access to \nclassified information. In January or February 2006, Applicant moved out of the home \nhe shared with his wife and began cohabiting with Z, who had left her husband and \nmoved to the United States with her two children. Z and her husband divorced.  \nApplicant and his wife were divorced on March 20, 2007. Applicant and Z were married \non March 26, 2007.  (Ex. 8; Ex. 9; Tr. 2 at 127.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant denied he could be coerced or \nblackmailed because of his relationship with Z. He reported, however, that the \nrelationship upset his parents, and they \u201ctried to organize a family-wide boycott of me \nand mine.\u201d  He also reported that two colleagues had commented on the relationship, \nadvised him to end it, and suggested that it could have social consequences for him at \nhis work. Applicant stated: \u201cThese efforts, while memorable, have left me totally \nunconvinced.\u201d  (Ex. 10 at 3-4.) \n  \n   \n \nZ, Applicant\u2019s second wife, is a citizen of Russia and Sweden and resides with \nhim in the United States. She received her academic training at a university in Russia \nand remains in contact with at least one of her former professors there. Her former \nhusband, a dual citizen of Russia and Sweden, is also a graduate of a Russian \nuniversity and holds a Ph.D. in Physics.  He lives and works in Russia.  (Ex. 3; Ex. 4; \nEx. 7; Ex. 11; Tr. 2 at 133.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife share their home with his wife\u2019s two daughters, aged 11 \nand 19, who are citizens of Russia and Sweden. Applicant\u2019s step-daughters visit their \nfather in Russia during the summer and during Christmas holidays. The younger step-\ndaughter spends approximately eight weeks with her father in Russia each summer, \nand she has weekly telephone contact with her father. The older step-daughter, who is \na college student in the United States, visits her father but spends less time in Russia. \n(Tr. 2 at 132-133.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law are residents and citizens of Russia. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law retired in the mid-1990s. Both were \nemployed by the Russian government and receive government pensions. Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law was the head of a government department that imported electronics. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is close to her parents: she speaks with them by telephone once a \nweek, and she sends them $300 a month for their support.  (Ex. 11; Tr. 2 at 133-134.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law is his wife\u2019s half-sister. She is also a citizen and resident \nof Russia. Applicant\u2019s wife has contact with her sister approximately every six months.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant thinks his sister-in-law lost her job.  He thinks she might be unemployed.  He \ndoes not know his sister-in-law\u2019s occupation.  (Answer to SOR; Tr. 2 at 135-136.)   \n  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Russia which appear in \nofficial U.S. government publications: \n \n \nSince at least 1997, Russia has targeted U.S. technologies and has sought to \nobtain protected information through industrial espionage. Russia\u2019s Directorate of the \nGeneral Staff (GRU) provides intelligence to Russia\u2019s military. The GRU carries out \nspecialized technical collection activities that threaten U.S. interests.  Additionally, a \nKGB-successor organization, the Federal Security Service (FSB), operates outside \nRussia by targeting national security and environmental researchers.  Russia also \noperates a signal intelligence facility in Cuba that targets the United States.  (HE 1: \nSummary at 1-3.)  \n \n \nIn addition to its technology collection and espionage activities against the U.S., \nRussia supports missile programs and nuclear and biotechnology projects in other \ncountries. These technologies can be used in the construction of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Despite U.S. concerns, Russia has refused to cease constructing nuclear \nreactors in Iran. (HE 1: Summary at 3-4.) \n \n \nRussia\u2019s internal problems include terrorism and a poor human rights record.  \nThe U.S. Department of State has warned U.S. citizens of safety concerns related to \ntravel in Russia.  (HE 1: Summary at 4.) \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State reports allegations that Russian government \nofficials and others conduct electronic surveillance without judicial permission.  This \nsurveillance includes FSB monitoring of internet and e-mail traffic.  Additionally, Russian \nlaw enforcement agencies have legal access to the personal information of users of \ntelephone and cell phone services.  (HE 1: Summary at 6-7.) \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens who are former Russian \ncitizens that, when they travel to Russia, they may be considered to be Russian citizens \nand not allowed to leave Russia unless they present a Russian passport.  (HE 1: \nSummary at 7.)    \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nHandling Protected Information \n \n \nAG \u00b6 33 describes the Guideline K security concern as follows: \u201cDeliberate or \nnegligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other \nsensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, \nreliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such information. . . .\u201d \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nIn 2005, when he transferred sectors in his company, Applicant was granted a \nsecurity clearance and eligibility for a special access program.  He was indoctrinated \ninto the special access program and provided with training and information on the rules \nhe was to follow in protecting classified or other sensitive information. He was \nspecifically instructed that as an individual cleared for a Special Access Program, he \nmust report \u201call close and continuing relationships with foreign nationals.\u201d At the time he \nreceived his training, Applicant was involved in an affair with a citizen of Russia. He \nchose not to follow the rules for protecting classified information and did not report the \naffair. This action raises security concerns under AG \u00b6 34(g), which reads: \u201cany failure \nto comply with rules for the protection of classified or other sensitive information.\u201d \n \n \nSeveral Guideline K mitigating conditions might be applicable to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. If \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 35(a) might apply.  If \u201cthe individual responded favorably to counseling or \nremedial security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the \ndischarge of security responsibilities,\u201d then AG \u00b6 35(b) might apply.  If \u201cthe security \nviolations were due to improper or inadequate training,\u201d then AG \u00b6 25(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified \nand other sensitive information occurred in April 2005, and is not therefore recent.  \nHowever, at his hearing, Applicant maintained that he was confused by the reporting \nrequirement and, therefore, his failure to follow the instructions given to him should be \nexcused. Applicant\u2019s continuing refusal to acknowledge his responsibility to comply with \na reporting requirement was intentional and has not been mitigated by the passage of \ntime. He knew that he should report the relationship and deliberately chose not to do so. \nHe failed to demonstrate a positive attitude toward the discharge of his security \nresponsibilities. Nothing in the record suggests that his failure to protect classified or \nother sensitive information was caused by improper or inadequate training. Accordingly, \nI conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), 35(b), and 35(c) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \nApplicant deliberately misled his employer and risked potential compromise of \nclassified information when he did not report his close and continuing relationship with a \nforeign national, despite clear instructions from his security officer to do so. Under AG \n\u00b615 of the Personal Conduct guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack \nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d Applicant\u2019s poor judgment and unwillingness to comply with the rules raise \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(e)(1), and 16(f) of the Personal Conduct \nguideline. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) reads: \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person might not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b616(e)(1) \nreads, in pertinent part: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(f) reads: \u201cviolation of a written or recorded commitment \nmade by the individual to the employer as a condition of employment.\u201d \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s disqualifying personal conduct might be mitigated if he \u201chas \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d  AG \u00b617(d).  Additionally, Appellant\u2019s disqualifying conduct might be mitigated \nif he \u201chas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d  AG  \u00b6 17(e). \n \n \n \nAppellant failed to follow his employer\u2019s rules for the protection of classified \ninformation. He was involved in an affair with a Russian citizen who knew he had \naccess to classified information. He failed to disclose this information to his employer \nand to his wife, who also held a security clearance and was a co-worker. At his hearing \nhe continued to excuse his lack of candor by stating that he was confused by the \nemployer\u2019s reporting requirements and therefore did not report the close and continuing \nrelationship with a foreign national. Applicant\u2019s defense of his failure to inform his \nemployer lacked credibility. He is a well-educated, intelligent man, who was not \nconfused by the security-reporting requirement. He failed to demonstrate that the \ndisqualifying behavior was unlikely to recur. He also failed to demonstrate that he had \nreduced or eliminated his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAccordingly, I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 17(d) nor AG \u00b6 17(e) applies to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \n\n \n9 \n \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts of Applicant\u2019s case raise security concerns under disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(d). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family \nmember, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of \nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d) reads: \n\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that \nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion.\u201d \n \n \nThe United States is a primary intelligence target of Russia. American citizens \nwith immediate family members who are citizens or residents of Russia could be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of Russia and Sweden. His step-daughters are \ndual citizens of citizens of Russia and Sweden; they visit their Russian father in Russia \nregularly, and they have a close relationship with him. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-\nin-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Russia. Now retired, Applicant\u2019s \nfather-in-law and mother-in-law worked for the Russian government and now receive \npensions from that government. Applicant shares his home with his wife, who has close \nfamilial relationships with her parents, her two children, and her sister. Applicant\u2019s wife \nspeaks with her parents on the telephone frequently, and she sends her parents $300 \neach month for their support.  These facts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(d). \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his wife and his wife\u2019s relationships with her \nchildren, her parents, and her sister are neither casual nor infrequent. Instead, these \nrelationships are based on long-standing family ties of affection and obligation. \nApplicant has an emotional bond of affection with his wife, a dual citizen of Russia and \n\n \n10 \n \n \nSweden, has strong familial obligations to her parents, her children, and her sister, all of \nwhom are citizens of Russia. These close relationships raise a heightened risk that \nApplicant, who is recognized internationally for his work, could be targeted for \nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by the government of Russia in ways that might also \nthreaten U.S. security interests.  \n \nApplicant is a native-born U.S. citizen who was educated in the United States.  \nHe has an international reputation as a researcher in his area of specialty, which has \nnational security implications. However, in 2005 he set aside his existing U.S. familial \nloyalties and chose a close personal relationship with a citizen of Russia, a country that \naggressively targets U.S. national security and environmental researchers in order to \ncollect U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic information. For several months, he did \nnot reveal his relationship with the Russian citizen to his first wife or to his employer \nbecause he did not deem it in his interest to do so. It is not clear from the record that he \nhas such long-standing relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that he could be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \n \nApplicant failed to rebut the Government\u2019s assertion that his contacts with his \nwife, a dual citizen of Russia and Sweden, his in-laws, who are citizens and residents of \nRussia, and his step-daughters, who are dual citizens of Russia and Sweden, created a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his family members who are citizens of Russia could force \nhim to choose between loyalty to his relatives and the security interests of the United \nStates.  (See ISCR Case No. 03-15485, at 4-6 (App. Bd. June 2, 2005).) I conclude that \nthe mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n11 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is a mature adult of 39 years of age. While assigned by his employer to follow \nrules to protect classified information as a government contractor, Applicant became \nromantically involved with a Russian woman. He did not report this relationship to his \nemployer, as he was required to do. He attempted to excuse his failure to report the \nrelationship by stating that he was confused by the reporting rules, a statement that \nlacked credibility. At his hearing, Applicant continued to evade his responsibility for his \nfailure to report the relationship, thereby continuing to raise security concerns and \nsuggesting that he remained vulnerable to the possibility of coercion or duress.  \n \nApplicant, a U.S. citizen, is a highly competent research scientist and an \ninternational leader in his field. By failing to disclose his affair with a Russian citizen, as \nrequired by his employer\u2019s security rules, he exposed himself and his employer to the \nrisk of possible exploitation and duress. He did not use good judgment in the choices he \nmade. His conduct had the potential to seriously compromise the work he was assigned \nto carry out on behalf of the United States. He put his relationship with a Russian \nforeign national before U.S. security interests. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guidelines K, \nE, and B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 11, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 1, \n2007, and I received the case assignment on November 16, 2007. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on November 20, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nDecember 13, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibit \n(AE) A, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nDecember 20, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by changing the account number \nlisted in \u00b6 1.b, from \u201cacct 6341\u201d to \u201cacct 6541.\u201d There was no objection from Applicant \nand the motion was granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old cost analyst for a federal contractor. She has a college \ndegree in business administration. She married in 2003 and her husband has four \nchildren from a previous marriage. Three children are emancipated and he pays \napproximately $800 in child support for the remaining child. Only $300 of that amount is \ncourt ordered.1  \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant and her boyfriend (later husband) started a communications \nretail business. The business was set up as a sole proprietorship. They thought they \ncould handle the business. She continued to work full time at another job and her \nhusband worked full time at the business. Some of their clients were truck drivers that \ncrossed over the border from Mexico. The business had customers and cash flow, but \nthere were large operating expenses. Applicant stated that the changing market and the \neconomic turmoil after the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, were reasons why the \nbusiness declined. To keep the business afloat, Applicant used credit cards to buy \ninventory, pay bills and finance the business.2 She also used them for personal \nexpenses. She had good credit at the time and estimated she had approximately 20-30 \ncredit cards.3 She would only make minimum monthly payments on the credit cards. \nDuring this same period of time she was unable to pay all of her taxes, including federal, \nstate and some taxes associated with the business, and accumulated approximately \n$30,000 in tax debt.4 Her pay was garnished and she completed the payments in \nNovember 2007. She has caught up with some of her taxes, but is still making \ninstallment payments for her 2005 and 2006 taxes. She owes approximately $2,000 on \n \n1 Tr. 82.  \n \n2 Tr. 64-67. \n \n3 Tr. 55-56. \n \n4 Tr. 24-25. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nher 2005 taxes and $6,000 on her 2006 taxes. She attributes this to not having enough \nwithholding taxes taken from her income.5 The business closed in December 2003. \n \n \n \nIn December 2003 Applicant was notified that she was being laid off. She \nofficially stopped work in January 2004 and remained unemployed until May 2004. Her \nhusband was working odd jobs, but did not have a good paying job. Applicant cashed \nout her 401k retirement account to pay her mortgage.6 In June 2004 she began work \nwith her current employer as a cost analyst. She earns approximately $68,000. Her \nhusband got a job in March 2005. He earns approximately $400 a month in salary and \n$1,900 in tips.7  \n \n \nIn December 2006, Applicant was diagnosed with operable lung cancer. She was \noperated on in April 2007 and was on medical leave from her job. After the surgery she \nwent through 12 weeks of chemotherapy. While she was going through her treatment \nshe received disability pay for four months. The amount she received was less than her \nsalary, thereby causing additional financial strain. All of her medical bills were paid for \nby her insurance. She admitted her illness did not contribute to her delinquencies, but \ndelayed her ability to repay her debts.8 \n \n \nApplicant filed bankruptcy on January 28, 2005. The petition was dismissed on \nApril 7, 2005. Applicant owns land that is worth approximately $26,000. The land has \nbeen in her family and she was concerned that she would lose the property if the \nbankruptcy proceeded.9 \n \n \nApplicant admitted she owes all of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR. In \naddition, she had other delinquent debts. She has paid approximately $15,000 of some \ndelinquent debts that are not listed on the SOR.10 She has paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.q.11 Applicant refinanced her home and cashed in her 401K pension plan to pay some \nof her debts.

None except the \none in SOR \u00b61. q has been paid.13 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband gamble approximately $100 a week at the local \ncasinos. Although she stated they do not go to the casino every week, she also stated \nthat some weeks they gamble more, but used the amount of $100 as an average. She \nconsiders this their form of entertainment and she stated their gambling has not caused \nthem to incur additional debts.14 \n \n \nApplicant believes she has the ability to repay her debts and stated she intends \non repaying all of her delinquent debts. She believes with pay increases from her job \nand merit awards that she will be able to save $8,000 that can be used to pay some of \nher debts.15 She has not sought financial counseling and does not know how long it will \ntake to repay all of her debts. She has a settlement offer from one creditor, but does not \nhave the money at this time to accept it. She anticipates she will be able to pay the \nsettlement offer in early 2008. She hopes to negotiate settlements with other creditors to \nreduce her delinquencies. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n13 Tr. 45-55. \n \n14 Tr. 78, 84-85. \n \n15 Tr. 60. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts), (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and (e) (consistent \nspending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis). \nApplicant has approximately $140,000 in primarily credit card debt. Her income to debt \nratio is very high. Most of the debt has been delinquent for several years. Applicant has \na history of not meeting her financial obligations and she is unable to significantly \nreduce the debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment),(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances), (c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control) and (d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  \n \nApplicant has approximately $140,000 in delinquent debts that remain unpaid \nand therefore are still current. Her financial problems began when she and her husband \nstarted a business and used credit cards to fund it when it was not making money to \nmeet expenses. She attributes this failure to a business downturn and that may have \ncontributed to it, they also organized it as a sole proprietorship that made them \npersonally responsible for all the debts. To keep the business afloat she used credit \ncards to pay for the expenses. The business downturn was beyond their control, but she \ndid not act responsibly under the circumstances. She used 20-30 credit cards to get \nmoney and then paid the minimum payment. This was a bad business decision that \ncaused her to go further into debt. The loss of her job after the business closed \nexacerbated the situation, but was not the initial cause of it. Also her medical condition \nseveral years later and her reduced income thwarted her ability to start paying her \ndebts, but again it was not the cause of her financial problems. Under the \ncircumstances I find AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. I also find that AG \u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies because some of the events that were beyond her control contributed to her \ninability to pay her debts, but were not the initial cause of the debts.  \n \nApplicant does not want to file bankruptcy because she wants to protect real \nestate that she owns. She has not sought financial counseling and has never calculated \nher total debt because the amount was too intimidating. Although she testified that she \nintends to repay all of her delinquent debt she does not have a realistic viable plan to \npay the large amount that she owes. Her intent to repay her debt may be genuine, but it \nis not a substitute for a realistic plan. She and her husband continue to gamble money \nthat could be used to repay some of their debt. She chooses not to file for bankruptcy \nbecause she does not want to lose her real estate. It appears Applicant is unwilling to \nmake the hard financial decisions associated with paying delinquent debts. I find AG \u00b6 \n20(c) and (d) do not apply.  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n7 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has substantial delinquent \ndebts. She and her husband made poor financial decisions associated with their \nbusiness. She lost her job and had serious medical issues, which reduced her ability to \npay her debts for a period of time. However, they were not the initial cause of the \nproblems. Applicant simply has too much debt and not enough income to pay it. She \nhas not sought financial counseling and despite her good intentions she does not have \na viable plan of action to pay the debt. She does not want to file for bankruptcy or sell \nher property, and continues to gamble as a form of entertainment. Considering the \noverall record of evidence, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from her financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r through v: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

By his demonstrated\ngood-faith disputes and discharge of his debts, extenuating circumstances associated with his debts\nduring a period of income loss from his wife and increased college expenses, Applicant mitigates\nsecurity concerns associated with his delinquent debts.  He successfully refutes allegations of\nfalsification of his security clearance application.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive\nOrder 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 31, 2007, and elected to have his case decided on\nthe basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June\n19, 2007.  Applicant submitted information in response to the FORM within the 30 days afforded\nhim to provide supplemental documentation regarding the issues. Included in the packet of\ninformation provided by Applicant were a cover letter of June 29, 2007, correspondence to and from\nhis creditors, an updated credit report, and documented settlement arrangements with two of his\ncreditors. The case was assigned to me July 16, 2007.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated two delinquent debts: one with\nAF in the amount of $5,538.00, and the other with BA in the amount of $14,639.00.  Under\nGuideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of\nApril 5, 2006 by answering no to having debts over 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his debts but denied the BA debt.  He also\ndenied falsifying his SF-86.  Applicant claimed to have paid the AF debt that he had continuously\ndisputed over a claimed significant mark-up of the debt over the purchase price of the item.\nApplicant disputed the BA debt, too (denying any knowledge of the debt), but documented a\nsettlement of the debt (with a $5,000.00 up-front payment and agreed monthly payments on the\n$5,000.00 plus balance) after claimed frustrated efforts to identify the debt as his own.  Applicant\nclaimed no knowledge of any delinquent debts when he executed his SF-86 (disputing his AF debt\nand unaware of any debts owed to BA).  Applicant attached copies of his payment agreements to his\nanswer.\n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 51-year-old quality engineer for a defense contractor who seeks continuation\nof his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are\nincorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant incurred a debt with RS (AF\u2019s assignee retailer)  in October 2004.  His May 2006\ncredit report lists a past due balance of $5,270.00 on a closed account with AF.  The same credit\nreport lists a $14,639.00 past due balance on a BA account.\nApplicant disputed both of his listed delinquent accounts.  He claimed his AF debt was\noverstated by over 100 per cent.  Applicant purchased a retail item from RS in October 2003 for\n$2,380.00.  AF reported an account balance of $5,270.00, which continued to accrue interest.\nApplicant has consistently disputed the amount of the debt and paid nothing on the account while\nhe continued to dispute the amount.    \nAF sued Applicant for the entire debt claimed in 2006.  Applicant responded to AF\u2019s petition\nin July 2006 and reiterated his claim that the underlying debt sued upon was overstated.  He\ndocuments settling with the creditor assignee in May 2007 for the reduced amount of $2,770.00 in\nfull satisfaction of AF\u2019s claim against him.\nConcerning his listed BA debt, Applicant denied any familiarity with the account and asked\nboth the creditor and the credit reporting agencies to remove the debt from his credit reports (see\nitem 3).  Frustrated over his inability to enlist any response from either the creditor or the reporting\nagencies, Applicant undertook accelerated steps to resolve the BA debt.  By virtue of a document\nrepayment agreement of May 2007, Applicant settled the BA debt for the reduced amount of\n$10,247.00 through a successor creditor or assignee: FB.  Without acknowledging responsibility for\nthe debt with either creditor, Applicant agreed to an up-front payment of $5,000.00 and monthly\npayments of $201.80 until the balance was discharged.  Applicant documents payment of the initial\n$5,000.00 to FB and agreement to pay the remaining balance.\nTo be sure, Applicant did fall behind with some of his valid accounts for a short period\nfollowing his wife\u2019s developing rheumatoid arthritis and suspension of work in 2003 to deal with\nher painful condition.  Complications from the prescribed medication caused her severe stomach\nproblems and ensuing hospitalization.  Because Applicant had relied on his wife\u2019s income to fund\nhis children\u2019s college expenses, her work loss placed a strain on Applicant\u2019s available financial\nresources.  Now that his wife has recovered and returned to work and both of his children have\ncompleted their college studies and are supporting themselves, college-related expenses are no longer\na concern of Applicant\u2019s.  \nAsked to complete an SF-86 in April 2006, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28(a) and\n(b), which inquired about any debts more than 180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively.  He\nattributed his negative responses to his unawareness at the time that he had any acknowledged\ndelinquent debts.  While he knew he owed money to AF\u2019s predecessor for the item he purchased in\n2004, he did not consider the debt delinquent at the time because he was disputing the amount of the\ndebt.  Whether or not the RS creditor would have accepted the lesser amount acknowledged by\n\n4\nApplicant is unclear.  Applicant\u2019s recent settlement with AF (RS\u2019s creditor assignee) covers a\nsettlement amount close to his claimed correct purchase figure and reflects a good faith dispute\nbetween Applicant and the creditor.  Under the circumstances, his claimed understanding that his\ndispute with the creditor precluded the debt\u2019s being considered a delinquent debt is sufficiently\nplausible to warrant acceptance.  His omission of this debt, accordingly, was not the result of a\nknowing, wilful omission. \nLess than clear is Applicant\u2019s claimed unawareness of the BA debt he denied any knowledge\nof and only recently settled out of claimed frustration with his lack of feed back from his inquiries.\nIt is conceivable that the debt originated with FB, whose debt he settled in May 2007.  But this is not\nclear either.  For FB could just as reasonably be an assignee of BA.  Given the current status of most\nof his accounts in his May 2006 credit report, his earnestness in resolving his debts, and the\nplausibility of his being confused over the BA debt considering all of the circumstances extant in the\nrecord, Applicant\u2019s explanations are entitled to acceptance.   His omission of this debt from his SF-\n86 was not the result of any deliberate falsification, but rather because of his lack of knowledge or\nrecollection of having such an outstanding debt with BA.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may\nlead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nPersonal Conduct\n\n5\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s]\nalleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The\nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively\ndemonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it\ncan deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks\nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing\nhis or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a quality engineer for a defense contractor who accumulated two significant\ndebts that he initially questioned and has since resolved.   Because he omitted these two debts (that\nwere reported in his credit report as charged off or in collection), security concerns were raised as\nwell over his debt omissions. \nFinancial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines where the individual appellant is so financially overextended as to indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\n\n6\nraise questions about an the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts and his failure to document payments on any of his\nlisted debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines\nfor financial considerations: DC 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and DC 19(c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations).\n Applicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to both his continuing disputes over the\njustification of  these listed debts and general revenue shortfalls during an extended period spanning\n2003 and 2006 when his wife experienced medical-related work loss and his children were in\ncollege. \nSince seeing his credit report and the SOR, Applicant has accelerated his efforts to resolve\nthese two listed delinquent debts and is able to document his paying one of the creditors (AF) and\nexecuting a settlement agreement with the other creditor (BA).  Given both his strained financial\ncircumstances during the 2003-2006 period and his documented responsible efforts to resolve his\ntwo outstanding debts (viz., AF and BA), Applicant may rely on MC 20 (b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations. \nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on his presented proofs.  Applicant is\nable to demonstrate credible disputes with his two listed creditors, with whom he ultimately reached\namicable payment arrangements.  Age of the debts at issue is covered by two of the mitigating\nconditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) has applicability, while not\ndispositive.   MC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis\nof the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) has applicability as well.\nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities,\namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person\ncleared to access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the\nholder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial\ndifficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt\naccumulations and documented steps taken to resolve them, Applicant mitigates security concerns\nrelated to his debt delinquencies.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of the SOR.\nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Applicant\u2019s clearance application\n\n7\nSecurity concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised under\nthe personal conduct guideline, too, as the result of his omissions of his two listed debts in the SF-\n86 application he completed in April 2006.  By omitting debts attributable to him over 180 and 90\ndays delinquent, respectively, Applicant failed to furnish materially important background\ninformation about his debts that was needed for the Government to properly process and evaluate\nhis security clearance application. \nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions are attributable to his good-faith disputes over whether either\ndebts was justified in amount and/or creditor identification.  Applicant\u2019s impressions at the time,\nwhile potentially mistaken, were made in good faith, without any indicated intent to mislead.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations, considering both the circumstances surrounding the furnished information\nat the time and Applicant\u2019s overall payment history, enable him to convincingly refute the\nfalsification allegations.  Considering all of the evidence produced in this record, favorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the personal conduct guideline allegations set forth in sub-\nparagraphs 2.a and 2.b of the SOR that Applicant knowingly and wilfully omitted debts more than\n180 and 90 days delinquent, respectively, when completing his security clearance application.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the\nE 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\n DECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.

Price, Esquire\nJanuary 23, 2009\nDecision\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 23,\n2006. On July 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines J, H, and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 7, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 6, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 9, 2008, and I convened\nthe hearing on November 6, 2008, in San Diego, California. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and three other witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. He submitted\nExhibits A through E, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on November 14, 2008. Based upon a review of the case\n\n2\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nAt the beginning of the hearing, allegation 3.d. of the SOR was amended due to\na typographical error. The first five words initially read, \u201cI do know know why.\u201d It should\nread and has been amended to read, \u201dI do not know why.\u201d The amendment was made\nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a., through 1.d., and 2.a.\nthrough 2.d., and he denied 3.a. through 3.d. The admitted allegations are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 51 years old. He served in the U.S. Air Force for four years, and he\nreceived an Honorable Discharge in 1981. \nApplicant works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in the following criminal\nacts:\n1.a. On December 5, 1985, Applicant was arrested and charged with Hit and\nRun-Personal Injury, a felony. He was found guilty, and he was sentenced to three\nyears confinement, which was suspended. He also was sentenced to three years\nprobation, and he was fined a total of $502.   Applicant served 36 days in confinement. \nApplicant testified that he was involved in an accident, but he exchanged\ninformation with the driver of the other car before he left the scene. Several days later,\nhe was arrested for leaving the scene of an accident where there were injuries. He was\nin jail for 36 days, before he accepted a guilty plea. He contended that there was some\nconfusion as to whether the crime was a felony or a misdemeanor, but he claimed that\nhe was informed that it was actually a misdemeanor, although he was originally told it\nwas a felony.  \n1.b. On September 7, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with being\nUnder the Influence of a Controlled Substance. He pled guilty to the charge and was\nsentenced to pay a fine of $100.\n\n3\nApplicant testified that this incident occurred when the police happened to be at\nhis home, because he was filing a report, as he believed he had property that had been\nburglarized from his home, and the police arrested him for being under the influence of\nan illegal substance. He testified that he had consumed a bottle of soda that belonged\nto his girlfriend, and unbeknownst to him, it contained methamphetamine. He claimed\nthat he pled guilty, even though he had not known that he had ingested an illegal\nsubstance. \n1.c. On December 14, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with being\nUnder the Influence of a Controlled Substance.  Applicant plead no contest to this\ncharge. He was sentenced to five years probation, fined $435, and sentenced to serve\n20 days of public service work.  He also was required to attend and complete a drug\ntreatment program. On April 10, 2003, his plea was set aside and the case was\ndismissed, after he completed the drug rehabilitation program. \nApplicant testified that this incident did occur as he was offered crystal\nmethedrine by an individual whom he knew, and because he was feeling under a lot of\npressure, he used the  methedrine (Tr at 132). As a result of this arrest he underwent\ntreatment at a Veterans Administration (VA) hospital. The records from his treatment at\nthe VA (Exhibit 6) and the statements attributed to him will be discussed below. \n1.d. On March 28, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with Count (1) DUI\nAlcohol/Drugs with a Bodily Injury and Count (2) Under the Influence of a Controlled\nSubstance. \nApplicant testified that on that occasion he was pulled over by a law enforcement\nofficer for having a brake light that was not working.  The officer said he was under the\ninfluence. His car was towed, and he was given a blood test. Applicant claimed that\nwhen he appeared at the arraignment the case was dismissed. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists four allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n2.a. Applicant used marijuana from approximately 1970 through 1975 on three or\nfour occasions. \n2.b. Applicant used cocaine on one occasion during the time period of 1975 to\n1977.\n2.c.  Applicant used methamphetamine. His testimony was that he only\nknowingly used it on one occasion in 2002, when it was offered to him, as discussed in\n1.c., above. \n\n4\nThe records from his treatment at the VA, prepared in 2003, directly contradict\nthis assertion that he only used methamphetamine one time. \nOn page 112 of Exhibit 6 there is a diagnoses of Amphetamine Dependence.\nThere is a notation under Medical  \u201cmeth scars on arms & legs \u2018from picking. \u2019\u201d Under\nPersonal Narrative it states: \nVeteran states he\u2019s coming to ADTP at this time because his wife does\nnot like him to use crystal meth. Veteran states he started using\nMethamphetamine in 1982 to help keep him awake or for his various jobs.\nHe\u2019s had one 2 yr. period of not using since then & that was in 1997,\nstating he couldn\u2019t afford it then. States he would typically stay away from\nit for 3-4 mos at a time. Withing (sic) the last yr., he reports smoking 1/4\nGm. of Meth about once daily or day & \u00bd.  Last smoked 12/14/02.\nUnder Comments on page 124 It states, \u201c[Veteran] states he\u2019s here because he\u2019s\nbeen using crystal Meth x 21 yrs., recently smoking it, states it\u2019s \u2018faster.\u2019\u201d\nApplicant is quoted on page 131 as stating, \u201cI\u2019m a functioning addict. I can quit,\nbut I just can\u2019t stay quit . . . My problems will begin [again] with Meth in about 6 months.\u201d\nFinally, on page 132 he states,\u201d It\u2019s easy to quit, hard to stay quit. The problem is\nthat I like it too much.\u201d\nThere are other examples of very specific statements attributed to Applicant\nabout his Methamphetamine usage. During his testimony, he contended that the\ntechnicians at the VA were simply making up false allegations or else making errors. He\nclaimed that they applied so much pressure on him that he just agreed with whatever\nthey told him, even if he knew it was not true.  \n Because of the specificity in the VA records and the numerous quotes attributed\nto Applicant about his long and frequent methamphetamine usage, the lack of any\nperceived reason for the VA to furnish incorrect and untruthful information, and other\nexamples of Applicant\u2019s less than complete candor, as will be discussed below, I find\nthat the VA\u2019s version of Applicant\u2019s drug usage history, that he used methamphetamine\nregularly over many years, is far more credible than Applicant\u2019s testimony that he only\nknowingly used Methamphetamine on one occasion.  \n2.d.  On February 21, 2003, Applicant was diagnosed as being Amphetamine\ndependent by a health provide with the Department for Veterans Affairs. This was\nstated in Exhibit 6. \n \n\n5\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe SOR lists four allegations regarding Personal Conduct concerns under\nAdjudicative Guideline E. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n3.a. Applicant executed a SCA on February 23, 2006 (Exhibit 1). Question #24 a.\nof the SCA asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had illegally used any\ncontrolled substance? Applicant answered \"Yes\" to this question, and he disclosed that\nhe used \u201cmethadrine\u201d on one occasion on December 2002. \nBased on the VA records, Applicant was long time user of methamphetamine,\nand he should have listed his many years of methamphetamine usage, as discussed\nabove in paragraph 2.c.  \n3.b. Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories on February 1, 2007 (Exhibit\n2) and March 27, 2007 (Exhibit 3).  He disclosed that he used methamphetamine on\none occasion in 2003 . Again, he should have listed all of his methamphetamine usage,\nas discussed above.\n3.c. Question #23 a. of the  February 23, 2006 SCA asked if Applicant had ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any felony offense? He answered \u201cNo\u201d to this\nquestion. He should have revealed his 1985 arrest and conviction for Hit and Run-\nPersonal Injury, a felony , as discussed in 1.a., above.  \nApplicant testified that he did not believe that he had to disclose this arrest\nbecause it occurred more than 10 years before his completion of the SCA (Tr at 122).\nHowever, the question did not limit the answer to 10 years, but asked whether he had\never been charged with a felony offense. Clearly he should have included this 1985\noffense. He also claimed that he was not sure if it was resolved as a felony. However,\nhe was informed initially that he was being arrested and charged with a felony, so there\nwas no legitimate reason for not listing this offense in response to question #23 a. \n3.d. Question #23 d. of the  February 23, 2006 SCA asked if Applicant had ever\nbeen charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? He\nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to this question, but he failed to reveal his 1997 arrest and conviction\nfor being Under the Influence of a Controlled Substance and his 2004 arrest for DUI\nAlcohol/Drugs with Bodily Injury, as discussed in 1.b. and 1.d., above.  \nApplicant testified that he was informed by the judge that his 1997 drug\nconviction was \u201cno worse than a traffic ticket\u201d so he did not believe that he had to\ndisclose this conviction (Tr at 130).  The question requested information as to being\ncharged or convicted of any offense related to drugs, and he should have included this\n1997 drug conviction. He also should have informed the Government about his 2004\narrest DUI Alcohol/Drugs with Bodily Injury.\n\n6\nMitigation\nThree witnesses testified on his behalf. Two of them had previously worked with\nApplicant, and one was the wife of one of the other witnesses. They also spoke in\nextremely positive terms about Applicant.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n7\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged\nin criminal conduct, as he was arrested for, and convicted of criminal offenses including:\nHit and Run-Personal Injury, a felony, and more than one count of being Under the\nInfluence of a Controlled Substance. Also, while it was not alleged, Applicant\u2019s failure to\nfurnish truthful information to the Government on his SCA and interrogatories and his\ncontinued use of methamphetamine also is criminal conduct. \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions (MC), I can not find that any MC applies to this Applicant, as there is no\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, because there is a significant pattern of criminal\nconduct, and Applicant has not been truthful about all of his criminal conduct or shown\nsufficient remorse.  Applicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 1 is found\nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, especially the possession and use of\nmethamphetamine over many years, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to\nhave access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal\nsubstance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25.\n(a) (any drug abuse), (c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution), and (e) evaluation of drug abuse or\ndependence by licensed social worker, in this case a diagnoses of Amphetamine\nDependence.\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s long and extensive use of methamphetamine and his\nfailure to be truthful about his usage, I do not find that any MC applies to this guideline.  \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H.\nApplicant, on the other hand, has failed to introduce any persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's\ncase against him.  Accordingly, Paragraph 2 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded\nagainst Applicant.\n\n8\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished\nincorrect, untruthful information to the Government in both a SCA, that he executed on\nFebruary 23, 2006 (Exhibit 1), and in interrogatories that he responded to on February\n1, 2007 (Exhibit 2) and March 27, 2007 (Exhibit 3).\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage and his criminal conduct to the Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 16. (a) applies\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, and falsification of relevant\nfacts from a personnel security questionnaire and interrogatories, which were used to\ndetermine security clearance eligibility. I can not find that any MC applies in this\nparagraph.  \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, exhibits questionable judgement,\nunreliability, and a lack of candor. I resolve Paragraph 3, Guideline E, against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines J, H and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case,\nand based on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct,\ndrug usage, and lack of honesty, I find that the record evidence leaves me with\nconsiderable questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:     Against Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:AGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:     Against Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:AGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:     Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:     Against Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Her intentional falsification on her Public Trust Position Application has not\nbeen mitigated.  A determination of trustworthiness and access to sensitive personal information is\ndenied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulations 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn April 27, 2007, DOHA, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\ndetermination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive\nSystems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 5, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 11, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on August 3, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 28, 2007.\nApplicant requested a continuance in the matter but good cause had not been shown and the\ncontinuance was denied.  At the hearing the Government presented six exhibits.  The Applicant\ncalled one witness.  She also presented thirteen exhibits and testified on her own behalf.  The record\nremained open until September 7, 2007, to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.\nShe submitted no additional documentation.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on September\n6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 26 years old and is recently re-married.  She is\nemployed by a defense contractor as a Customer Service Representative and is seeking to obtain a\ndetermination of trustworthiness in connection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a determination of trustworthiness, on\nthe basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and thorough\nreview of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for a determination of trustworthiness because she is financially overextended and at risk\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits the delinquent debts set forth in allegations, 1(a), 1(d), 1(e),1(g),1(h),\n1(i), 1(j), 1(k), 1(l), 1(m), 1(n), 1(o), 1(p), 1(q), 1(r), 1(s),1(t), 1(u), 1(v), 1(w), 1(x), and 1(y) of the\n\n3\nSOR.  She denies the delinquent debts set forth in allegations 1(b),1(c) and 1(f).  See Applicant\u2019s\nAnswer to the SOR).  With respect to the debts that she denies, the Applicant plans to dispute the\ndebt listed in 1(b).  The debts listed in 1(c) and 1(f) the Applicant now realizes she owes.\nCredit reports of the Applicant indicate that she is indebted to 26 separate creditors, 19 of\nwhich are collection accounts, totaling an approximate amount of $24,144.00.  (See Government\nExhibits 2,3,4, 5, and 6).  Each of the debts remain outstanding and delinquent. \nThe Applicant has lived on her own since the age of eighteen.  At that time, in 2001, she\nmarried an active duty Navy sailor, later separated from him and moved in with a boyfriend who beat\nher.  She left him, and returned to her husband to try to restore their relationship.  During these\nrelationships, the Applicant opened up credit accounts and when things did not work out, she left\nwithout considering the debt she had accumulated.  \nThe marriage was unsuccessful and in April 2007, the Applicant\u2019s divorce from her husband\nwas final.  She has full custody of a  three year old son from the marriage.  Her ex-husband provides\nher with $300.00 a month in child support.  The Applicant attributes her youth, inexperience and\nirresponsible nature as the reason why she has bad credit.  She states that after receiving the SOR,\nshe realized the importance of maintaining good credit.  Recently she has contacted several of the\ncreditors and set up payment arrangements, but has not yet made a payment.  As to a couple of the\ndebts, she has made a payment or two, but nothing more.  She plans to pay off each of her delinquent\ndebts in full.  \n      \nWhen asked as to why it has taken so long to begin to handle her finances, she explained that\n\u201cHonestly, I \u2018m 26.  My mother died when I was young.  My grandmother adopted us.  She died.\nI was my own adult.  I had to teach myself.  No one said, Do this, do that.  I learned the hard way.\nNow this right here, to me is minor compared to the things that could have happened, so now that\nall this is brought to my attention and I see, Hey, you\u2019re an adult.  This is gonna follow you.  You\ncant\u2019 just say.  Okay, I \u2018m moving out of that apartment on to the next.  This follows you.\u201d  (Tr. pp.\n84-85).\n \nWithin two weeks of her divorce, the Applicant was remarried to a soldier in the National\nGuard.  He is deploying to Iraq in a couple of days.  The Applicant and her new husband both\ntestified that the extra monies he will earn from his overseas deployment will be used to satisfy her\ndelinquent debts.    \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for a determination of trustworthiness because she intentionally falsified material aspects\nof her personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (Standard Form 85-P) dated\nJanuary 11, 2006.  Question 20 of the application asked the Applicant if, in the last seven years, she\nhas ever been more then 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See\n\n4\nGovernment Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that she was over\n180 days delinquent on the debts set forth in allegations 1(j) through 1(z) of the SOR.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR).     \nThe Applicant explained that she was not trying to be dishonest when she answered the\nquestion, but was not aware of anything derogatory on her credit report when she filled out the SF-\n86, implying that she was unaware of her numerous delinquent debts.  (Tr. p. 80).  She attributes this\nto simply being irresponsible and inexperienced at keeping track of her financial indebtedness.  (See\nTr. pp. 80-81).  Her credit reports show at least 20 debts that have been in collection, some dating\nas far back as 2000.  (See Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6). \nI find that the Applicant knew or should have known to reveal the truth about her delinquent\nfinancial history.  The fact that she had never looked at her credit report before does not forgive the\nfact that she knew that she had opened up numerous credit accounts that she did not pay.  She should\nhave revealed this information on her application.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant deliberately\nattempted to conceal this information from the Government on her Pubic Trust Position application.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n19.  Conditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)\n inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)\n a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  OF special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n16.  Condition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a determination of trustworthiness and access to sensitive personal\ninformation is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive\ninformation twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for such access may\nbe involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a\ndetermination of trustworthiness.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the\nApplicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to\novercome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of\npersuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a\ndetermination of trustworthiness.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F) and she has been untruthful on her Public Trust Position\napplication (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her determination of trustworthiness\neligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With\nrespect to her finances, the Applicant has in excess of $24,000.00 in delinquent debt, that she has\nnot yet started paying.  It is recognized that the Applicant experienced some real hardships in life at\n\n7\na very young age.  Along the way, she accumulated lots of debt that she did not pay.  She has\nrecently remarried and plans to use her new husband\u2019s pay check and the extra allowance that he\nreceives for going to Iraq to pay her delinquent debts.  However, at this time the debts remain\noutstanding and owing.  She has plans to pay her debts off and is currently in the process of setting\nup payment plans and starting the payment process.  She has just started to address her debts and has\na long way to go before they are resolved.  At the present time, she has not presented sufficient\nevidence to demonstrate a track record of financial responsibility or that she has resolved her\nfinancial indebtedness.\n  \nUpon review of her financial statement,  it appears that she now has some disposable income\nat the end of the month that she plans to use to pay her past due bills.  However, as of yet she has not\ndone so.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.  Under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and 19(c)\na history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  Her\nfinancial problems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt,\ngood faith effort to repay her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her debts.   Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Applicant contends that she did not know about her credit\nreport and what was on it at the time she completed her application for a Public Trust Position.  This\nvery well may have been true, but the Applicant knew that she had opened up credit accounts that\nshe did not pay, and she should have revealed these delinquent debts on her application.  With the\nparticular evidence that I have been provided, there is no reasonable excuse for her failure to answer\nthe questions truthfully.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been\ncompletely honest with the Government regarding her financial history and she sought to conceal\nthe truth.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)  the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant\ndeliberately failed to reveal this information to the Government.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing her request for a trustworthiness determination.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a\nfinding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs\n1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                            Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                            Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                            Subpara.  1.t.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n                            Subpara.  1.y.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.z.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nto grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability, and eligibility for the Applicant\nto hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\n\n9\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

For this item, report information regardless of whether\nthe record in your case has been \u2018sealed\u2019 or otherwise stricken from the court record). He testified\nthat he did not list the 1997 charge because he thought it was  no longer on his record, and he did not\nlist the 2002 charge because he thought it had been dismissed.6\nA few days after executing the security clearance application, Applicant checked his criminal\nrecord using an online state records website, and discovered both charges.

I find\n11\nthat he did not disclose the 2002 charge when he met with the FSO after completing the security\nclearance application.\nIn response to Question 28b (Your Financial Delinquencies    Are you currently over 90\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)), Applicant did not disclose a medical bill (subparagraph 1.c.(2)), a\nphone bill (subparagraph 1.c.(3)), a satellite television bill (1.c.(4)) and a credit card bill\n(subparagraph 1.c.(5)). All were 90 or more days delinquent when he completed the application.\nSOR subparagraph 1.c.(1) identifies a delinquent amount, that Applicant allegedly should\nhave disclosed in response to Question 28b, but does not identify a specific creditor, referring to it\ninstead as \u201ca medical provider.\u201d\n\nTr. 38.\n12\nTr. 36.\n13\nTr. 39.\n14\nTr. 42.\n15\nId.\n16\n4\nSubparagraph 1.c.(2) stems from treatment he received in 1992 after being hit by a car. He\nwas a teenager living with his mother at the time.  He was unaware of any outstanding bills from\n12\nthe injury.13\nApplicant made a lump sum payment to the phone company approximately five years ago.\nHe thought that this had settled the bill in its entirety.14\nApplicant thought he had paid the satellite television delinquency before completing the\napplication.  With respect to the credit card, he knew he was delinquent, but did not know it was\n15\nmore than 90 days delinquent.  Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 27a requiring him to disclose\n16\nwhether he had ever been 180 days delinquent on a debt.\nIn response to Question 27d (Your Financial Record   In the last 7 years, have you had any\njudgments against you that have not been paid?), Applicant did not list a 1999 judgment. He listed\nit, however, in response to Question 27a (Your Financial Record   In the last 7 years, have you had\nyour wages garnished or had your property repossessed for any reason?).\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n17\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Board June 17, 2005 at 3).\n18\n5\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nGuideline J -  Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n17\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct\nSubparagraph 1.c.(1), alleging that Applicant falsified the SOR by failing to disclose \u201ca\nmedical provider\u201d is overbroad because it does not identify a specific creditor. Although an SOR\ndoes not have to satisfy the strict requirements of a criminal indictment, it must still place an\napplicant on adequate notice of the allegations so that he may have a reasonable opportunity to\nrespond and prepare a defense.  Subparagraph 1.c.(1) does not meet this minimum threshold,\n18\ntherefore, I conclude that it is not justiciable.\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application omissions raise the issue of whether Personal\nConduct Disqualifying Condition 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\napplies. His explanations for not listing the debts that were 90 or more days overdue were credible\nin light of the financial information he disclosed elsewhere on the application.\n\n6\nApplicant did not list a 1999 judgment in response to Question 27d, but listed it in response\nto 27b. PC DC 16(a) does not apply to his answers in the finance section of the security clearance\napplication.\nConversely, Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing to list the drug charges was not credible. He\nhad a responsibility to list the charges regardless of whether either still appeared on any state\ndatabase. PC DC 16(a) applies to these omissions. Moreover, Applicant was found guilty of at least\none drug-related charge in both 1997 and 2002. Consequently, his assertion that he thought nolle\nprossed or dismissed charges did not have to be listed was incongruous with the facts. \nWithin two weeks  after completing the application, Applicant contacted his company\u2019s FSO\nto disclose the 1997 drug charge. Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) 17(a): the\nindividual made prompt good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts, applies. This contention was confirmed by the FSO\u2019s\nmemorandum.\nThe memorandum, however, does not reference the 2002 drug charge, and his contention that\nhe also informed the FSO about it is supported by no other record evidence. Also, it is contradicted\nby an earlier contention that he did not inform the FSO of the 2002 drug charge. PC MC 17 (a) does\nnot apply to his omission of the 2002 drug charge. Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal\nconduct security concern.\nCriminal Conduct\nFor the reasons set forth above, Applicant has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct security\nconcern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant displayed admirable initiative in attempting to better himself by leaving his lawn-\nmowing job to work in a more challenging position, and in returning to college. This favorable\nattribute is outweighed by the dishonesty displayed in falsifying his security clearance application.\nEvaluating this case in light of the whole-person concept, I conclude he has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.(1):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.(2):\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.(1):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.(2):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.(3):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.(4):\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.c.(5):\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Rogalski, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 2 August 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nC and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 28 September 2007, and requested a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 3 December 2007, and I convened a hearing 8 January\n2008. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 11 January 2008.\n \nJune 3, 2008\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the Guideline C allegations, but denied the Guideline E\nallegations. He is a 35-year-old senior policy analyst employed by a defense contractor\nsince October 2002. He seeks to retain the security clearance he has held since about\nMarch 1992.\nApplicant is a dual citizen of the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom\n(U.K.), having acquired U.S. citizenship by birth and U.K. citizenship by naturalization in\nJanuary 2006  (G.E. 1). In January 2006, he obtained a U.K. passport that is valid until\nJanuary 2016. He used the U.K. passport to travel to China in 2006 with a U.K. tour\ngroup. He also uses his U.K. passport to obtain access to U.K. military installations to\nwork on company contracts with the U.K. He holds a security clearance from the U.K.\nApplicant described three reasons for obtaining U.K. citizenship (Tr. 45). First,\nthe U.S. government allows dual citizenship. Second, he was eligible for U.K. citizenship\nthrough his marriage to a U.K. citizen and his residence in the U.K. Third, he thought\nU.K. citizenship would be helpful for performing contract work for the U.K. and other\nEuropean governments.\nApplicant was born, raised, and educated in the U.S. He attended college at a\nU.S. military academy, serving as the brigade commander his senior year, and\ngraduating at the top of his class in June 1995 (G.E. 2). One perquisite of graduating\nfirst in his class was being sent to graduate school immediately, which he attended from\nOctober 1995 to August 1997 in the U.K. While in graduate school, he met his future\nwife, a U.K. citizen. They married in the U.K. in January 2000.\nApplicant completed his U.S. military obligation in September 2002, having\nserved two overseas deployments, and having been awarded the meritorious service\nmedal, the [service] commendation medal (twice), and paratrooper qualifications. He\nand his wife settled in the U.K., and he obtained employment with the U.K. subsidiary\n(wholly owned) of a major U.S. defense contractor.  The company has stringent\nrequirements for the work it will undertake for foreign governments (A.E. A),\nrequirements that apply both organizationally and individually.\nApplicant and his wife own a home in the U.K.\u2014with about $600,000 equity\u2014\nand have the necessary financial accounts to pay their mortgage and other living\nexpenses. Applicant has about $110,000 in retirement accounts in the U.S. He\ncontinues to vote in U.S. elections, but has not voted in U.K. elections. He pays taxes\nas appropriate to the U.K., the U.S., and his state of legal residence in the U.S.\nBefore applying for U.K. citizenship, Applicant took reasonable steps to ensure\nthat he would not be risking his U.S. citizenship by acquiring U.K. citizenship. He\nchecked both the U.S. Department of State website and with the consular division of the\nU.S. Embassy in London. His research satisfied him that his U.S. citizenship was not at\nrisk. However, he did not contemplate whether acquiring U.K. citizenship would put his\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nclearance at risk, and so did not inquire about that issue, either with the state\ndepartment or company colleagues.\nIn becoming a naturalized U.K. citizen, Applicant took and oath of loyalty to\n\u201ccrown and queen.\u201d After acquiring U.K. citizenship, he reported that fact to his\nimmediate supervisor, and to the company\u2019s human resources division. He assumed\nthat the information would be through normal company channels anywhere the\ninformation was needed. He did not report the information to the company security\nofficer until it became an issue during his subject interview in November 2006.\nAt this stage in his life, Applicant is unwilling to renounce his U.K. citizenship. He\nis similarly unwilling to surrender his U.K. passport, as it certifies his citizenship for\naccess to U.K. military bases required for him to perform contract work for the U.K.\ngovernment. He has not obtained U.S. government approval for possession and use of\nhis U.K. passport.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship\n3\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not\nlimited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; accepting educational, medical, retirement, social\nwelfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country; residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship\nrequirements; using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country; (b) action\nto acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen;\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in\n4\na foreign country;\n\u00b6 11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n5\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C by\nshowing that Applicant acquired U.K. citizenship in January 2006, and obtained, used,\nand continues to use for business purposes, a U.K. passport that will not expire until\nJanuary 2016.  Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline C security concerns. Although\n3\nU.S. law recognizes dual citizenship, it does not encourage it\u2014for a variety of practical\nreasons. Furthermore, there are significant differences between cases where dual\ncitizenship arises by operation of law, as is the case when an individual is born a dual\ncitizen or becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen from a birth country that does not\nautomatically terminate the foreign citizenship, and cases where a U.S. born citizen\nactively seeks foreign citizenship. Those differences are highlighted by the adjudication\nguidelines for foreign preference, perhaps more accurately described as divided\npreference. For Applicant\u2019s conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C,\nhe must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the\nUnited States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the\nUnited States is not required before the government can seek to deny access under\nGuideline C.\nThe government has a compelling interest in ensuring those given public trust\npositions will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may\nalso be a citizen. Applicant acquired U.K. citizenship by pledging allegiance to the\nBritish crown and the reigning monarch. That oath is more recent in time than any\nApplicant took as a commissioned officer in the U.S. military. He used the fact of his U.K\ncitizenship to acquire a U.K. clearance, which he uses for base access, and presumably\nwould use to have access to U.K. information in performance of duties for the U.K.\ngovernment. Yet, he assures that he could and would protect U.S. information. He fails\nto see how his divided preference puts him in an untenable. The U.S. and the U.K.\nshare a wide variety of common interests. They do not share a unity of interests.\n \nApplicant meets none of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference.\nHis dual citizenship is based on his actively seeking U.K. citizenship.  He has not\n4\nexpressed a willingness to renounce his foreign citizenship.  All exercise of dual\n5\n\n\u00b6 11(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n6\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 11(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority;\n7\n\u00b6 11(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\n8\ninvalidated; \n\u00b616(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n9\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n5\ncitizenship occurred while he was an adult.  Applicant's use of his U.K. passport has not\n6\nbeen sanctioned by the U.S.  He stated no willingness to invalidate his passport.  While\n7\n8\nApplicant has a legal right to maintain his dual citizenship with its attendant benefits and\nresponsibilities, those benefits and responsibilities create an irreconcilable conflict with\nhis responsibilities to the United States. I resolve Guideline C against Applicant.\nThe government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nThe government\u2019s evidence does not establish that Applicant was aware of any specific\nrequirement to report his U.K. citizenship through his company\u2019s security channels.9\nFurthermore, Applicant reported his U.K citizenship to his immediate supervisor and the\ncompany human resources division, and not unreasonably assumed that the\ninformation would be disseminated through regular company channels to any division\nwith a need for that information.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 25-year-old junior production engineer employed by a federal contractor. She 4 is married and has no children. She has a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering. She has no 5 6 military service and this is her first application for a security clearance.7 Applicant was born in the United States, moved with her parents to Columbia in 1996 to finish high school, and in 2000, returned to the United States. Her father is a citizen and resident 8 of Columbia, her mother is a citizen of the United States residing in Columbia, and her husband\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Columbia.

Eight aunts and uncles are citizens and residents of the\nUnited States.  Six are citizens and residents of Columbia.  Her only sibling is a citizen and resident\nof the United States.  She owns property in Columbia.  She has frequent, non-casual contact with her\nparents.  Her husband has the same with his parents.  Her ties to the United States do not mitigate\nthe security concerns about foreign influence.  She surrendered her Columbian passport to her\nfacility security officer (FSO) thereby mitigating the security concerns about foreign preference.\nClearance is denied.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated February 25, 2005).\n1\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006)\n2\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service,\n802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).\nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative\n3\nnotice). \n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 25, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 16, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 8, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 3, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on August 8, 2007.  I convened a hearing on August 27, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nThe government offered two exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-2.  Applicant offered three exhibits,\nmarked as Exhibits A-C.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  I kept the record open until\nSeptember 17, 2007, to allow Applicant the time to file additional documents.  She filed seven\ndocuments that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D through J.  The government had no objection\nand the exhibits were admitted.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 5, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAdministrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Government Exhibits A3\nthrough A7.  Applicant stated he had no objection to administrative notice of the exhibits. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.   The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice\n2\nfacts that are either well known or from government reports.   I took administrative notice of various\n3\nfacts derived from Government Exhibits A3 through A7, as indicated under subheading \u201cColumbia\u201d\nof this decision.\n\nTr. at 10, 17.\n4\nId. at 11.\n5\nId. at 13.\n6\nId. at 15.\n7\nId. at 22.\n8\nId. at 40.\n9\nId. at 23.\n10\nId. at 25.\n11\nId. at 25-27.\n12\nId. at 28.\n13\nId. at 32; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J (Letter from Applicant\u2019s Father, dated September 13, 2007) at 1.\n14\n4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 25-year-old junior production engineer employed by a federal contractor.   She\n4\nis married and has no children.   She has a bachelor's degree in industrial engineering.   She has no\n5\n6\nmilitary service and this is her first application for a security clearance.7\nApplicant was born in the United States, moved with her parents to Columbia in 1996 to\nfinish high school, and in 2000, returned to the United States.   Her father is a citizen and resident\n8\nof Columbia, her mother is a citizen of the United States residing in Columbia, and her husband\u2019s\nparents are citizens and residents of Columbia.  She traveled to Columbia in December 2004 and\n2006.   In 2005, her parents deeded her residential real property in Columbia, having a value of\n9\nbetween $60,000 - $70,000.\nApplicant has one sister who is a United States citizen living in the U.S.   Her maternal\n10\ngrandmother, 76, is a United States citizen living in Columbia.  She worked in an electronics\nbusiness prior to her retirement and return to Columbia.   Her paternal grandmother, 90, is a resident\n11\nand citizen of Columbia.  Her father has eight siblings, four are citizens and residents of the United\nStates, and the other four are citizens and residents of Columbia.  Her mother has six siblings, all\ncitizens of the United States, four of whom are residents of the United States and two are residents\nof Columbia.   None of her extended family members have ever worked for the Colombian\n12\ngovernment.   In 1984, her father was convicted in the U.S. of drug conspiracy.  He was incarcerated\n13\nuntil 1996, and then deported.   This year, her mother spent four months in the United States,\n14\nreturning to Columbia at the end of August 2007.  Her parents own the property where she and her\n\nId. at 34-36.\n15\nId. at 41-42.\n16\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (Letter from Facility Security Officer, dated March 12, 2007) at 1.\n17\nTr. at 20, 28-29.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits E-H (Appreciation and Quality Awards, dated April 20, 2006 to at least June 2007).\n19\nAdministrative Exhibit 3 (Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006: Columbia, United States Department\n20\nof State, dated March 6, 2007) at 1.\nAdministrative Exhibit 7 (Consular Information Sheet: Columbia, United States Department of State, dated June 21,\n21\n2007) at 1.\n Administrative Exhibit 5 (Travel Warning: Columbia, United States Department of State, current as of June 4, 2007)\n22\nat 1.\nId. \n23\nAdministrative Exhibit 7, supra, note 18, at 2-3.\n24\n5\nsister live.   She communicates weekly with her mother and twice per month with her father.

On\nMarch 12, 2007, she surrendered her passport to her facility security officer (FSO), who accepted\nresponsibility for her passport, and secured it in his office.  If this passport is returned to Applicant,\nDOHA will be immediately notified.17\nApplicant maintains a 401(k) plan through her employer.  She and her husband have checking\nand savings accounts, they vote in U.S. elections, and they live rent-free in the U.S. property\nbelonging to her parents.  When the real estate market in Columbia improves, she plans to sell her\nproperty and invest the proceeds in a home in the United States.   She has received several quality\n18\nawards from her employer.19\nColumbia\nColumbia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy, and  with a population of approximately\n42 million.  It is the second most populous country in South America.  Any person born in\n20\nColumbia is considered a Colombian citizen.21\nThe Department of State warns U.S. citizens to the dangers of travel to Columbia.  Violence\nby narco-terrorist groups and other criminal elements continues to affect all parts of the country,\nurban and rural, including border areas.  Citizens of the United States and other countries continue\n22\nto be victims of threats, kidnapings, and other criminal acts.   Official Americans and their families\n23\nhave severe restrictions on travel to and within Columbia due to these dangers.   Kidnap or murder\n24\nvictim in Colombia have included journalists, missionaries, scientists, human rights workers, and\n\nId.\n25\nAdministrative Exhibit 4 (Consular Information Sheet: Columbia, United States Department of State, dated August\n26\n17, 2006) at 1.\nId.\n27\nAdministrative Exhibit 7, supra, note 18, at 3.\n28\nId. at 2.\n29\nId.\n30\nAdministrative Exhibit 6 (Chapter 2 - Country Reports: Western Hemisphere Overview, Country Reports on Terrorism,\n31\nUnited States Department of State, dated April 30, 2007) at 5.\nId.\n32\nAdministrative Exhibit 7, supra, note 18, at 2.\n33\nAdministrative Exhibit 6, supra, note 28, at 5.\n34\nAdministrative Exhibit 3, supra, note 17, at 1.\n35\n6\nbusiness people, tourists, and even small children.   Approximately 370 kidnapings committed by\n25\nterrorist groups and for-profit kidnap gangs were reported to authorities in 2005.  There was at least\n26\none kidnaping of an American citizen in 2005.   Armed robbery and other violent crimes are\n27\ncommon in major cities.28\nThe secretary of state has designated free Colombian groups - the Revolutionary Armed\nForces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and the United Self-Defense\nForces of Colombia (AUC) - as foreign terrorist organizations.  These groups have carried out\nbombings and other attacks in and around major urban areas, including against civilian targets.29\nTerrorist groups have also targeted critical infrastructure (e.g., water, oil, gas, and electricity), public\nrecreational areas, and modes of transportation.   The FARC has targeted civilians, government\n30\nrepresentatives, politicians, soldiers, and the civilian infrastructure.   Three Irish Republican Army\n31\nmembers assisted in training the FARC on IRA bomb tactics in Columbia.   The FARC continues\n32\nto hold three U.S. government contractors as hostages - all U.S. citizens - who were captured in\nFebruary 2003 when their small plane went down in a remote area of Columbia.   Some border areas\n33\nhave become terrorist safe havens.34\nAlthough the governments respect for human rights continued to improve, serious problems\nremain.  Unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, insubordinate military\ncollaboration with criminal groups, torture and mistreatment of detainees, overcrowded and insecure\nprisons, and other serious human rights abuses were reported during the 2006.  Illegal armed groups\nand terrorist groups committed the majority of human rights violations - including political killings\nand kidnapings, forced disappearances, torture, and other serious human rights abuses.35\nColombia is a major source of women and girls trafficked into prostitution.  Victims are\nprimarily sent to European and Western Hemisphere countries.  There also is internal trafficking in\n\nId. at 19.\n36\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n37\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n37\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n38\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n39\n8\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.38\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.39\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and\ninterests\u201d stating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or she]\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in\nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case, including:\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n40\n9\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nand\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned\nor foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country,\nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.40\nApplicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship with her mother.  She also has twice\nmonthly contact with her father.  Her parents gave her property in Columbia, and own the apartment\nbuilding in the U.S. where she and her sister live.  Her close relationship with her parents creates a\nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because of the terrorist activities of the\ndrug cartels in Columbia.  Her connections to her parents also creates a potential conflict of interest\nbecause her relationship is sufficiently close to raise a heightened risk for a potential conflict\nbetween helping or protecting a loved one and protecting classified information.  Her father\u2019s\nconviction for drug conspiracy, the fact he served 12 years imprisonment, and then was deported\nfurther heightens the concern. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  As previously\nindicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable\nto these disqualifying conditions:\n((a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\n\n10\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they\nare unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure the individual.\nGuideline  \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) applies to her relationships with her parents and her parents\nextended families.  Her contacts with her parents are frequent, and not casual, given the ownership\nof property she has in Columbia, and her living in their property here in the U.S.  These very frequent\ncontacts do not mitigate the security concerns because it is likely Applicant could be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between her parents and the interests of the United States.  She did not\nmeet her burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [her relationship with her parents] could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  Accordingly, I conclude SOR \u00b6 2. against\nApplicant.\n \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a sufficient relationship\nand loyalty to the U.S., as she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.  She has lived in the United States from birth to 1996, and again since 2000.  She is a U.S.\ncitizen by birth, as is her sister.  She received her college  education in U.S. colleges and universities.\nHowever, she owns property in Columbia, worth a sizeable amount of money.  It  could potentially\nbe used to influence, manipulate, or pressure her.  Guideline \u00b6 8(f) does not apply.  Applicant has\nstrong contacts and linkage to the United States, but her continued linkage to Columbia is\nproblematic.  Although this mitigating condition is partially applicable, these facts are insufficient\nto overcome the security concerns as discussed in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nGuideline \u00b6 9. The Concern. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nGuideline \u00b6 10. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen\nor through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.\nGuideline \u00b6 11. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.\n\nISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007).\n43\n11\nApplicant possessed a valid Columbian passport on March 12, 2007, when she surrendered\nher passport to her facility security officer, who accepted responsibility for her passport, and secured\nit in his office.  Should the passport is returned to Applicant, DOHA will be immediately notified.\nThe passport expired June 24, 2007.  The mitigating condition of Guideline \u00b6 11 (e) has been\nsatisfied and I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not\nconsider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the\nJudge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances.\u201d   The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are\n41\nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve misconduct,\nvoluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant\nof the nine APFs to this adjudication.   In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable\n42\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall\ncommon sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s\npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or\nher] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by\nthe facts of a given case.\u201d43\nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nApplicant has lived in the United States for twenty-two of her twenty-six years.  Her mother and\nsister are also U.S . citizens.  Eight of fourteen aunts and uncles are residents and citizens of the U.S.\nHer ties to the United States are stronger than her ties to family members in Columbia. Her\nColumbia passport has expired.  There is no evidence she has ever taken any action which could\ncause potential harm to the United States.  She takes her loyalty to the United States very seriously,\nand she has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several years.  No witnesses recommended\ndenial of her security clearance or produced any derogatory information about her.   \n\nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990). \n44\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n45\n12\nThe circumstances that weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis are: (1)  she has\nfrequent and non-casual contact with her parents who currently live and reside in Columbia; she talks\nto  her parents frequently. These contacts with her parents are manifestations of her strong affection\nand regard for her parents; (2) she owns property in Columbia; (3) her parents own the property\nwhere she and her sister live;  and (4) her father\u2019s drug conviction.  Insufficient information was\nprovided pertaining to the details of her father\u2019s drug conviction and subsequent deportation.  \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against\ngranting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised, it is deemed best to err on the side of\nthe government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d   After\n44\nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context\nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has  not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to\nforeign influence.  This is a close case, but ultimately the evidence leaves me doubts about her\nsecurity suitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my\n45\napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my\nresponsibilities under the Guidelines.  Applicant has not overcome or successfully mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s case.  For the reasons stated, I conclude she is not eligible for access to classified\ninformation.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of security significant offenses during his 20-year tour of military\nduty for which he either received non-judicial punishment or engaged in otherwise probative\nconduct, including a positive test for cocaine in 2002.  Of added security concern are Applicant\u2019s\nomissions and misstatements in his clearance updates and latest OPM interview.  His recurrent\nhistory of pattern criminal conduct (inclusive of his omissions and misstatements in the clearance\napplications and OPM interview he completed) cover an extended period of time (over 20 years in\nall) and are not mitigated under Guidelines J and E.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 12, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on October 10, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on October 30, 2007.  A hearing\nwas held on October 30, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At\nhearing, the Government's case consisted of 19 exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself)\nand one exhibit.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on November 7, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel requested leave to keep the record open\nto permit counsel to locate a DSS agent to testify regarding Applicant statements in his OPM\ninterview.  Department Counsel\u2019s request was granted, conditioned on the testimony being enlisted\ntelephonically.  Near the close of the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew her request.  \nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the record with\ncharacter references.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause being\ndemonstrated, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant furnished three character references.  There being no objection from the\nGovernment, and good cause demonstrated, Applicant\u2019s character references are admitted as\nApplicant\u2019s exhibit B.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have (a) had non-judicial punishment (NJP)\nimposed  on him on four separate occasions between 1984 and August 2000 in cases involving (I)\ndrunk driving and operating an Army vehicle without a driver\u2019s license (December 1984), (ii) simple\nassault and drunk and disorderly conduct (September 1992), (iii) larceny of NAF property (August\n2000), and (iv) wrongful use of cocaine (March 2002), (b) been charged with domestic\nviolence/assault (October 1997), which was later dismissed, and (c) falsified his security\nquestionnaires in 1994, 2000, and 2006.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his security clearance\nquestionnaires he executed in 1994, 2000, and 2006, respectively, by omitting his past use of\ncannabis as determined by a positive urinalysis test conducted in April 1992 , his domestic violence\ndomestic violence/assault charge in October 1997, his larceny charge in August 2000, for which he\nreceived NJP), his use of cocaine as determined by a positive urinalysis test in November 2001, and\nhis revoked clearance and access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) by the Army in\n\n3\nAugust 2002 and (b) his understating the number of times he failed a drug test, omitting his positive\ncannabis test in April 1992, and misrepresenting the disposition of his August 2000 larceny charges\n(falsely claiming the charges were dismissed).\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted his 1984 drunk driving and operating without\na license charges, his August 2000 larceny charges, and his March 2002 wrongful use of cocaine\ncharges.  He denies each and every remaining allegation.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 47-year-old training specialist for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant enlisted in the Army in August 1982 and served for 20 years of active duty before\nhis discharge in August 2002 (see ex. 1).  Following his discharge, he returned home to care for his\nfather and work odd-jobs.  While on active duty, he committed a number of offenses for which he\nreceived NJP.  In December 1984, records reflect that he was charged with DuI and operating\nwithout a drivers license (ex. 7).  He was subsequently awarded NJP, which consisted of a forfeiture\nof pay in the amount of $100.00.  While Applicant does not recall this arrest or NJP award, he\nprovides no proof of any mistaken identity in the commander\u2019s report of discipline (see ex. 6). \nFour years later (in September 1992), Applicant was charged with simple assault and drunk\nand disorderly conduct following his acknowledged consumption of alcohol (R.T., at 62-63) and\nengaging in  verbal/physical exchange with his wife.   He was assigned seven days of extra duty for\nhis NJP (see ex. 9; R.T., at 64-66). \nRecords reflect that Applicant tested positive for cannabis in April 1992 (see ex. 18).  After\ninitially the positive test (R.T., at 50-51), Applicant retreated and denied ever testing positive for\nillegal drugs in April 1992 and denied ever using marijuana after his teens (R.T., at 55).  The\nreported test results reference Applicant\u2019s social security number, are probative of the test as\nreported, and are accepted absent evidence of a chain of custody mixup or other evidence to\ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s disclaimers. Whether Applicant was ever apprised of the positive test results\nis not clear from the test result documentation, but is presumed to have occurred absent evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s change of duty assignment or other circumstances that could have complicated notice\nof the test results.\nIn October 1997, Applicant was charged with domestic violence/assault.  In a domestic\ndispute with his spouse (W2), he grabbed her wrist and caused a red mark on her forearm (see ex.\n10; R.T., at 66-67).  Applicant was subsequently apprehended by military police and arrested (ex.\n10; R.T., at 68-69).  W2 declined to prosecute, and the charges were dismissed (ex. 11; R.T., at 69).\n \nIn August 2000, Applicant was charged with larceny of NAF property after being observed\nexiting a base commissary without paying for a pair of sunglasses (see exs. 14 and 15; R.T., at 70).\n He was awarded NJP that entailed grade reduction and forfeiture of pay of one month (see ex. 13;\n\n4\nR.T., at 70-71).  In November 2001, Applicant attended a house party with a friend.  During the party\nhe observed some white powder on a table, which he suspected was cocaine (R.T., at 72-73).\nWithout checking the identity of the substance, he sampled it (R.T., at 73).  In a random drug test\nadministered by his Army command the following week, Applicant tested positive for cocaine (R.T.,\nat 73).  He was awarded NJP by his command in March 2002 for wrongful use of cocaine (see ex.\n16) and was reduced in grade.\nAsked to complete a clearance application (DD398) in February 1994, Applicant answered\nno to ever using illegal drugs (ex. 3).  In doing so, he omitted both his use of marijuana as a teenager\nand his testing positive for marijuana in April 1992 (see ex. 3; R.T., at 75, 77).  Records reflect that\nApplicant tested positive for marijuana in a test administered by his command (ex. 18).   He initially\nacknowledged his positive test and could not explain why he failed to list the positive test in his 1994\nDD38 (R.T., at 50-51).  Asked again about his omission of his 1992 positive test, he denied any\npositive drug test in April 1992 (R.T., at 55, 77, and 88).  His e-qip omission of his positive April\n1992 drug test simply cannot be reconciled with his claims of a good-faith failure to list the positive\ntest under all the circumstances considered.  With over 20 years of military experience, Applicant\nwas inferentially aware of DoD\u2019s policy against the use of illegal drugs.  Acknowledgment of a\npositive test would clearly constitute adverse information that Applicant could reasonably be\nexpected to want to avoid if he could.  Absent any credible explanations that his omission of his\nmarijuana use in his DD 398 was inadvertent or mistaken, inferences can not be averted that his\nomissions were knowing and wilful.\nApplicant was asked to complete another clearance application (SF-86) in January 2000 (see\nex. 2).  In this SF-86, he omitted his October 1997 domestic violence charges.  Applicant indicated\nhe does not know why he omitted this 1997 arrest (R.T., at 77).  This arrest was both recent and\nmaterial to his background investigation and is not an isolated omission.  When considered as a part\nof a pattern of omissions of material adverse information, the omission cannot be excused as the\nresult of a good-faith mistake.\nApplicant completed his third and last security clearance application (an e-qip version) in\nJanuary 2006 (see ex. 1).  In this application, Applicant omitted his administered NJP in August\n2000 that resulted from his shoplifting arrest. Applicant\u2019s denial of any deliberate intention to omit\nhis larceny charge on his e-qip is not persuasive and warrants an adverse inference of deliberate\nomission under the evidence presented. \nApplicant also omitted his November 2001 positive drug test in the e-qip he completed in\nJanuary 2006.  Responding to question 24 of the e-qip, Applicant answered in the negative to the\nquestion that inquired about prior drug use (see ex. 1).  Applicant attributes his denial to his mistaken\ninterpretation of the question: He claims he interpreted the question to be asking about whether he\nwas a user of drugs, and not one that placed an illegal substance in his moth on one occasion (R.T.,\nat 86-87).  Applicant\u2019s claims that his omission was not deliberate are not convincing, and cannot\navert inferences of intentional omission. \nApplicant omitted other material adverse information in his 2006 e-qip.  He omitted both his\nclearance revocation and withdrawn access to SCI by the Army in May 2002 (see ex. 19).  Reasons\nassigned for the Army\u2019s 2002 clearance revocation and withdrawn SCI access are contained in the\nSOR attached to the revocation/withdrawal notice.  Referenced adverse information indicated recent\n\n5\ndrug use, criminal charges, and alcohol-related incidents.  Applicant never responded to the SOR,\nand the Army issued its final clearance revocation and SCI withdrawal notice based on its compiled\nreported information (ex. 19).  While Applicant claims he never received the SOR or ensuing LOR\nand denies using illegal drugs (R.T., at 80-81), he provides no proof of address change or other\ncircumstances that could lend light on why he never received the SOR, while still stationed at his\nmilitary facility in May 2002, or the ensuing LOR before his August 2002 discharge.  Still, the SOR\nand resulting LOR include no written receipt acknowledgments, and it remains at least plausible that\nwith his impending discharge fast approaching, Applicant\u2019s command failed to copy him with the\npertinent SOR and LOR notices.  Considering all of the circumstances surrounding these alleged\nomissions, Applicant\u2019s non-receipt claims are accepted.  This being the case, his omission of his\nclearance revocation and SCI withdrawal is excused.\nIn the results of interview he certified to in April 2007, Applicant certified to statements he\ngave to the OPM interviewer in August 2006 (see ex. 4).  When asked in the 2006 interview about\nwhether he had ever failed a drug test, Applicant stated that the only drug test he failed was in\nNovember 2001, and had never used illegal substances since his use of marijuana at age 16 (ex. 4;\nR.T., at 82).  He also claimed to have listed in his 2006 e-qip (see ex. 4).  To be sure, Applicant not\nonly failed to list his November 2001 positive drug test, but he failed to disclose his April 1992\npositive cannabis test as well.  At hearing, Applicant initially acknowledged the positive April 1992\ndrug test (R.T., at 50-51),  but could not explain why he failed to mention the test in his interview\n(R.T., at 51).  When asked again about his omission of this April 1992 test, however, he retreated\nand denied the existence of a positive test in April 1992 (R.T., at 55). Without credible explanations\nfor why he failed to mention his documented April 1992 positive urinalysis (see ex. 18) in his 2006\ninterview, he can not be absolved of his omission of the test in this interview. \n In this same 2006 interview he certified to, Applicant told the OPM interviewer that the 2000\nshoplifting charges were dismissed, and \u201cbecause nothing ever really came of it,\u201d and he just did not\nthink about it when he filled out his SF-86 (see ex. 4).  Having certified in his interrogatory response\nthat the information he provided the OPM interviewer in 2006 was correct, his credibility is put to\na considerable test when he disclaims the statements he made to the OPM interviewer regarding his\nunderstanding of the larceny charges (R.T., at 37-47; 83-86).  Absent persuasive corroboration of\nhis disclaimers, his statements lack the requisite credibility to warrant acceptance.  Inferences\nwarrant under the circumstances that his interview accounts of this shoplifting charge were made\nknowingly and wilfully to conceal the NJP he received from his command with respect to the filed\ncharges.\nApplicant is well regarded by co-workers who are familiar with his work habits.  His assistant\nteam leader, his previous Army superior, and co-workers and former fellow members of his active\nduty command collectively endorse his leadership skills, professionalism and character (see exs. A\nand B).  Each of his references vouch for his integrity and dedication and recommend him for a\nposition of trust and access to classified information. \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\n\n6\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules and regulations. \nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\n\n7\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant has a considerable  history of arrests and charges arising out of assorted alcohol-\nrelated incidents, assaults, shoplifting, and cocaine use that resulted in his receipt of NJP in\nconnection with four of the covered incidents. Applicant\u2019s recurrent offenses over an 18-year period,\ncoupled with his omissions and misstatements he made in three separate security clearance\napplications he completed and an ensuing OPM interview he submitted to in August 2006 raise\nsecurity significant issues about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \nArrest/charge issues\nWhile in military service, Applicant was arrested on five separate occasions over an 18-year\nperiod (spanning 1984 and March 2002) for charged criminal offenses.   The offenses for which he\nwas charged are varied: DuI (December 1984), simple assault and drunk and disorderly conduct\n(September 1992), domestic violence/assault (October 1997), larceny of NAF property (August\n8000), and wrongful use of cocaine (March 2002).  All but one of the charged offenses resulted in\nNJP.  Only his 1992 charged offense of simple assault and drunk and disorderly conduct was\ninitiated in a civilian court, and these underlying charges were dismissed after his wife declined to\nprosecute.  A sixth allegation of criminal conduct did not result in any criminal arrests or charges\nbut derived from his ensuing omissions/misrepresentation in the security clearance applications\nApplicant executed, and statements given to an OPM interviewer in an interview Applicant sat for\nin August 2006. \nApplicant's recurrent criminal charges and NJP dispositions over an 18-year period are\nsufficient to invoke four of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal\nconduct, i.e., DC 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and DC 31(b) (allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted).   Together, these adjudicated offenses and proven actions that reflect\nconduct covered by Guideline J reflect an unbroken pattern of criminal conduct that spans over 20\nyears. \nConsidering the number of accumulated offenses and (six in all, including the SF-86\nomissions and ensuing OPM misstatements) over an extended period of time, they cannot be\nconsidered either isolated or aged.  While each of the offenses assessed alone might warrant\nmitigation, our Appeal Board has cautioned against considering them in piecemeal.  Because of the\nhigh regard he is held in by co-workers and supervisors, his actions warrant some application of MC\n32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement).  It is still too soon, however, to\nmake safe predictions against recurrent conduct, given Applicant\u2019s long pattern of charged offenses\nduring his active duty tour in the military and his ensuing omissions/misstatements in his clearance\napplications and most recent OPM interview. \n\n8\nTaking into account all of the developed evidence of record, Applicant fails to mitigate\nsecurity concerns associated with his historical pattern of criminally-related charged offenses and\nomissions/misstatements when asked to provide detailed information about his charged offenses in\nthe clearance applications he completed.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-\nparagraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline J. \nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for\nholding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s omissions of his\ndomestic violence/assault, shoplifting and positive drug test offenses in the security clearance\napplications he executed in 2000 and 2006 and the OPM interview he appeared for later in 2006.\nSo much trust is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that candor lapses cannot\nbe easily excused.   Applicable disqualifying conditions comprise DC 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities) and DC 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative).  \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to promptly correct his SF-86\nomissions and misstatements in a prompt, good-faith manner.  In the past, the Appeal Board has\ndenied applicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC 17(a) (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts) where the applicant has waited many months to timely correct a known\nomission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal Bd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-\n1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995).  Compounding Applicant\u2019s omissions is failure to acknowledge\nhis clearance application omissions and ensuing misstatements reported in the OPM agent\u2019s\nsummary of interview of Applicant in August 2006.\nBy minimizing his past involvement in his reported charged offenses and positive test of\nillegal substances in his clearance applications and ensuing OPM interview, Applicant concealed\nmaterially important background information needed for the government to properly process and\nevaluate his security updates. His attributed reasons for his omissions and misstatements\n(misinterpretation, lack of recall, and disputing the offense) lack the necessary persuasiveness to be\nconsidered sustainable grounds for averting conclusions of falsification.  Weighing all of the\ncircumstances surrounding his omissions and misstatements and lack of any prompt, good faith\ncorrections, Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns associated with his judgment and candor\nlapses in omitting material information in the clearance applications he completed in 2000 and 2006\nand most recent OPM interview.\n \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the\nDirective (inclusive of the E2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-\nparagraphs 2.b through 2.d and 2.f through 2.g of Guideline E.  Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to subparagraphs 2.a and 2.e of the same Guideline.\n\n9\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, I make\nthe following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a - 1.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.b - 2.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.f - 2.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n____________________ \n \nDecision \n____________________ \n \n \nBraeman, Kathryn M., Administrative Judge: \n \nHistory of the Case \n \n            The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant on June 14, 2007. The SOR detailed reasons why the \nGovernment could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.1 \nThe SOR alleged specific concerns over Financial Considerations (Guideline F) in \nparagraph 1 based on the revised Adjudicative Guidelines2 issued on December 29, \n2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense, to be effective September 1, \n2006.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer of July 7, \n2007 where he admitted three of the allegations, denied one, and requested a hearing.  \n \n     1 This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended and revised.    \n     2 A copy of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines was sent with his Statement of Reasons (SOR). \n\n \n2 \n \n \n \n            Department Counsel on July 25, 2007, submitted a Ready to Proceed notice.  \nSubsequently the case was assigned to me on July 31, 2007.  A Notice of Hearing \nissued on August 16, 2007, set the matter for September 26, 2007; subsequently, an \nAmended Notice of September 20, 2007, set the case for September 24, 2007, after \nApplicant agreed to this change.   \n \n            At the hearing Department Counsel offered five documents (Exhibits 1-5) that \nwere admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant offered five documents \n(Exhibits A-E), testified himself, and called his wife as a witness.  At his request and as \nthe Department Counsel did not object, we left the record open until October 8, 2007, in \norder for him to submit supplemental information.  (TR 35-36, 83)  He timely submitted \nten pages of records (Exhibit F); Department Counsel reviewed the documents and \nstated on October 9, 2007, that he had no objection to them being admitted into \nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on October 2, 2007. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n            After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon \ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact: \n \n            Applicant is 33 years old and has worked as a pipefitter for a defense contractor \nfrom July 2001 to present. Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86) to obtain a security clearance in June 2005 and signed it in September 2005. \n(Exhibit 1; TR 28)  He understands that he needs a security clearance for a promotion \nto supervisor, not for his current job.  (TR 32) \n \nApplicant was a student at a state university from 1993 to 1995.  He received no \ndegree.  He married in July 1999 and has two children, ages 3 and 7.  (Exhibit 1; TR \n26)  For the past eighteen months he has been taking leadership classes at a university; \nif he passes the defense contractor pays the tuition bills.  So far he has passed 15 \nhours of his classes and is working towards a supervision certificate and an associate\u2019s \ndegree.  He has a certificate for several completed classes in the 2006 to 2007 period.  \n(TR 27-28, 29-30; Exhibit F)  Applicant has not served in the U.S. military, but did \nregister with the U.S. Selective Service System. (Exhibit 1)   \n \nFinances \n             \n            Applicant disclosed on his SF 86 that he had his wages garnished in 2002 for \nunpaid rent after his roommates left the area early. He explained that he could not \nafford the rent and had to terminate the contract early.  He paid this debt in full.  He \ndisclosed a 2007 tax lien that was issued in error.  He disclosed no unpaid judgments.  \nHe reported that he had bills over 180 days delinquent \u2013 four student loans of \napproximately $5,000 each from 1999, 1998, 2003, and 2002.  He consolidated those \nloans in November 2004 and reported in 2005 that he was current paying off that debt \n\n \n3 \n \n \nof approximately $21,000.  He reported no debt(s) over 90 days delinquent.  (Exhibit 1)  \nHe had these loans from the time he was in school from 1993 to 1995.  (TR 26) \n \n            In response to a Financial Interrogatory sent to him, Applicant stated in March \n2007 that he would pay a $100 medical bill and a $175 debt to another creditor on April \n1, 2007, but he explained he was unable to make timely payments or set up a payment \nplan for his student loans. He explained that he was again in school at a community \ncollege. (Exhibit 2) \n \nApplicant has made progress in resolving these ongoing, delinquent debts. He \npaid the $100 to Creditor #1 in April 2007.  (SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Answer; Exhibits 2, 5; TR 33-\n34)   \n \n            At the hearing he stated that in 2006 he re-financed his home , hoping to settle \nand pay off his student loans with the additional $13,500 he received.  He had three \nprivate loans which were in default and a federal loan that was in forbearance.  When \nhe made the payment, his intent was to pay on the loans that were in default as he had \nbeen given a settlement figure by a collection agency.  However, the money was \nmistakenly credited instead to his federal loan that was in forbearance as all the loans \nhad the same number.  Beginning in January 2006, he was paying $100 per month to a \ncredit agency on the student loans that were in default.  However, in August 2007 they \ninsisted that he had to pay $300 per month, which he could not afford.  He then worked \nwith another credit agency and has made consistent payments to them since June 2007 \nof $190 per month.  His ultimate goal is to work out the loans in default and reach a \nsettlement. (Exhibits A, B, C, D, E; TR 23-25; 37-43, 46-47, 54-56; 56-58; 60-62)  He \ndocumented his making $190 monthly payments on his consolidated student loans.  \n(Exhibit F) \n \n            At the time of the hearing, he stated he owned a home on two lots; but he was \nalso behind on his mortgage payments as money is tight given his expenses.  He made \nthose payments in September 2007.  His wife earns $1,600 a month and works full time \nas a surgical technician. She also is in school full time studying to be a registered nurse \nand has taken student loans in her name to attend the program.  They hope when she \ngraduates they will have more financial resources.  She had one more semester to \ncomplete to graduate with honors in May 2008.  (Exhibit F; TR 44-45; 50-53; 69-73)  \nApplicant reported that he earns $460 per week and provided a detailed breakdown of \nhis monthly expenses.  They have especially high child care expenses as his wife is in \nschool and working; and Applicant often also has to work weekends.  (Exhibit F; TR 52-\n53; 59-60) \n \n            Applicant\u2019s supervisor assessed him as a \u201ctake charge kind of guy, who, you \ncan surely depend on in a crunch.\u201d  He described him as very intelligent, well mannered \nand a good worker.  He explained that Applicant serves as a \u201cmake-up foreman\u201d when \nthe supervisor is not at work.  He sees that Applicant \u201cstrives for excellence in all that he \ndoes.\u201d  He is in the company leadership development program, and he views Applicant \nas a \u201cfuture leader.\u201d  (Exhibit F) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n            Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in \nevaluating an individual's security eligibility which are divided into conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns.  In deciding whether to grant or continue an individual's access to \nclassified information, the mere presence or absence of any adjudication policy \ncondition is not decisive.   \n \n            Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I \nweighed the relevant Revised Adjudication Guidelines, and determined the following \nsecurity concern was relevant to my determination: \n \nGuideline F:  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern caused by financial problems is: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, clack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation.  \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial \ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n            The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to \ndemonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \napplicant's access to classified information. Then the applicant may present evidence to \nrefute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive \nOrder 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an \napplicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do \nso is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial \noverall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may draw only those \ninferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of \nrecord.   \n \n            Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security \nclearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.3 It is merely an indication that the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a security clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n      \n            The government provided substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nreflecting a medical debt and three unresolved student loans totaling approximately \n$25,000 which went into default.   Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying \nCondition, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  His financial problems are \nsufficiently significant to raise security concerns. \n \n            With the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifted to Applicant \nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case \nagainst him.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and, \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n     3Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) partially applies1 because his financial problems \u201coccurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He fell behind on his student \nloans because he was attending school.  He was unable to make greater payments \nbecause his wife was also attending school, and they have small children at home that \nrequire expensive childcare services. In January 2006, he was making payments of \n$100 per month on his student loans, and in June 2007 he increased his payments to \n$190 per month. His payments are current. His wife will graduate in May 2008, and the \nfamily income will significantly increase as she will be able to obtain employment as a \nnurse.  He does not receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the family will continue \nto be under financial stress until his wife graduates from college and her income is \navailable to offset their expenses.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) provides that security concerns may be mitigated when, \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., \nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant and his wife chose to attend school and have a family in lieu of other choices \nthat might have resulted in more income and less expenses. Applicant described his \ntight financial circumstances as he and his wife both work full time, and both are in \nschool to try to better themselves.  He adequately explained how he \u201cacted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d He has accumulated some additional debt as he got behind \non his mortgage; however he documented how he corrected that problem.  Thus, he \nhas a plan in place to resolve three delinquent student loan debts.  Further, Applicant \ndemonstrated that he intended to settle his student loans in default when he re-financed \nhis house in order to resolve those financial issues.  He paid the medical debt. He \nreceives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b).   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies.  Although Applicant did not receive financial counseling, \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  One \nSOR debt is paid.  The others are under payment plans, and Applicant has been current \non his payments for a sufficient period of time to demonstrate his responsibility and to \ndemonstrate the problem is under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies because he \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply as Applicant did not \n\u201cdispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem.\u201d \n \nIn sum, Applicant documented his resolution of his medical debt in 2007 and \nnegotiated with the debt collection agency for his three student loans to accept a \npayment of $190 per month that he is regularly paying.  His extraordinary efforts to try to \nresolve these date debts is reflected by his decision to refinance his house in 2007 with \n \n1See generally ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available \nunder the good faith mitigating condition for debts being resolved through garnishment). \n  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe plan of settling these old student loan debts; but the $13,000 was mistakenly \ncredited to a different loan. Sallie Mae applied the payment to a different loan with the \nsame account number which was in forebearance, as he is also back in school.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \nBoth Applicant and his wife are full time workers, who attend school to advance \ntheir careers in the future.  They demonstrated they will have additional financial \nresources when his wife completes her degree in May 2008.  He is taking courses to lay \nthe ground work that will prepare him for promotion to supervisor with high pay.  \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor attests not only to the quality of his current work, but to \nhis potential for advancement at the company. \n \nHaving considered both the record and Applicant in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d \nconcept, I conclude he is a sincere person who made substantial efforts to reform his \nfinancial practices.  He is on the road to financial recovery. There is little potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress as he has stable employment. His supervisor \nassesses him as reliable and trustworthy.  Applicant\u2019s supervisor summed him up as a \n\u201ctake charge kind of guy, who, you can surely depend on in a crunch.\u201d   \n \nIn conclusion, financial issues do not remain a security concern. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations. I rule For Applicant in subparagraphs 1.a through \n1.d. as he paid or developed and implemented a plan to resolve his student loan debts.  \n \n            After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process \nsection, I make the following formal findings: \n                                                 \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:                                       FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:                             For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n            In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the \nApplicant.  Clearance is granted. \n \n \n___________________________ \nKathryn Moen Braeman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

WESLEY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts that stem from periods of unemployment and\nburdensome student loan obligations.  Unable to make any payment progress with her debts with her\nlimited resources, she has petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Based on her absence of any\npayment progress or favorable prospects for being able to do so in the foreseeable future, she is left\nto rely on a successful bankruptcy outcome to stabilize her finances.  Her progress to date with her\nbankruptcy and the trust she inspires with her friends and colleagues make possible predictions that\nshe will successfully complete the bankruptcy petition she has initiated.  Applicant mitigates\nfinancial concerns associated with her accumulation of delinquent debts.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn June 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, and Department of\nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of Applicant\neligibility for occupying an ADP I/II/III position, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a trustworthiness determination clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 6, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on October 10, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on November 1, 2007.  A\nhearing was convened on November 1, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s\napplication for a trustworthiness determination.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of five\nexhibits.  Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and three exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was\nreceived on November 9, 2007.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts: She is\nalleged to have incurred 16 delinquent debts altogether, which exceed $24,000.00 in total.  \nFor her response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted each of her debt-related allegations, and\nprovided no explanations of the circumstances that contributed to her debt difficulties.  Nor did she\nindicate any plans to resolve her debts.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 25-year-old customer service representative of a defense contractor who seeks\na trustworthiness determination.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant has worked for her current employer since 2003 and has supplemented her work\nwith college courses at a local community college (R.T., at 21-23, 41-42).   She accumulated a\nnumber of delinquent debts during periods of unemployment in 2000 (while still in high school) and\n2002 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 34).  Altogether, she accumulated some 16 delinquent debts that exceed\n$24,000.00 in aggregate indebtedness.  Of these debts, her deficiency debt with creditor 1.e on a car\nrepossessed by the creditor in September 2006 is by far her largest debt.  She purchased a Chevrolet\nMalibu in May 2004 for $16,682.00 and made payments of $380.00 a month for two plus years\nbefore defaulting in her loan (R.T., at 24-25).  Creditor 1.e repossessed the vehicle and resold it at\npublic auction.  Applicant was later advised that a $10,652.00 deficiency balance remained following\npublic sale of the vehicle (R.T., at 23).  Creditor 1.e offered to settle the deficiency for $5,000.00 in\n2007, but Applicant did not have available funds to accept the offer (R.T., at 24).\n\n3\nAnother sizeable debt is for back rent for $2,784.00 that was placed for collection by the\nlandlord (creditor 1.f) in September 2005.  Applicant attributes the debt to her alleged failure to give\nthe required 30 days notice to terminate (R.T., at 25).  Applicant disputes this claim (assuring she\ngave the requisite 30 days notice) and found out much later that the rent claim was still reflected in\nher credit report (see ex. 5; R.T., at 25).  Once she learned of the rent claim in her credit report, she\ncontacted the lessor\u2019s new management company.  Neither the new company nor the credit reporting\nagency were of any help in reversing the rent charges for Applicant (R.T., at 26-27).  Without any\ndocumentation to evaluate the credibility of her notice assurances, the accuracy of her notice claims\ncannot be validated. \nBesides her major debts with creditors 1.e and 1.f, Applicant remains indebted to creditor 1.m\nin the amount of $3,653.00.  This debt represents a defaulted school loan.  She initially had a\npayment arrangement with Sally Mae (the original lender) in 2005-2006 but could no longer meet\nher monthly payment obligations.  Her other student loans with Sally Mae are now in default as well\n(R.T., at 27-30).  She is indebted, too, with creditor 1.n in the amount of $2,379.00 for towing\nservices rendered after her car was accidentally totaled in April 2000.  She had no insurance at the\ntime to cover the towing expenses.  Her only other major debt in collection is with creditor 1.o in\nthe amount of $1,275.00 .   This is a credit card debt, and Applicant has had no contact with this\ncreditor.\nApplicant\u2019s remaining debts in collection comprise 10 separate debts that collectively total\nless than $3,400.00.  Her monthly take home pay is around $1,800.00 (R.T., at 35).  She has  current\nmonthly expenses in excess of $1,900.00 and consequently has not been able to develop any\nrepayment plans (R.T., at 40).  She is looking for a second job to supplement her income (R.T., at\n40-42), and has considered debt consolidation, but has not pursued it (R.T., at 51).  She petitioned\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in September 2007 and awaits her first hearing, which is scheduled\nfor November 2007 (see ex. C; R.T., at 51-52).   The docket sheet covering the petition notes that\nall of the required documents were not filed with the petition (ex. C).  Documented debtor credit\ncounseling and current income and means testing were not provided either by Applicant.  Whether\nshe has filed the required statements covering counseling and income/means testing with the\nbankruptcy court is unknown at this time.  Without such documentation, though, no predictable\nassessment can be made as to her likelihood of a successful discharge.\nApplicant is highly regarded by coworkers who are familiar with her work.   She is described\nas a caring single parent who has demonstrated consistent honesty and integrity at work and in her\npersonal life (see ex. A).  She has received certificates of recognition for her quality work with her\nemployer (see ex. B).\nPOLICIES\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the Defense Office\nof Hearing and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,\nCommunication and Intelligence (ASDC31), entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA),\nwhich gave DOHA responsibility to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel\nworking on unclassified Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2-R.\n\n4\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E2.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable\ncriminal acts.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\nApplicant's application for a trustworthiness determination may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position depends, in large\npart, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge\nmay draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or\nconjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain an ADP I/II/III position.  The required showing of material\nbearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant\nhas actually abused a trust relationship before it can deny or revoke a trustworthiness determination.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to adhere to principles of trust.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant to establish his or her\ntrustworthiness  through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nApplicant is a highly regarded customer service representative for a defense contractor who\naccumulated a number of delinquent debts during periods of financial set backs primarily attributable\nto periods of unemployment, and insufficient income from her jobs to cover her living expenses and\nstudent loans. With the limited resources available to her, she has barely been able to keep up with\nher current household expenses and debts and has not been able to pay on any of her old debts.\nWhile at least one of  her old debts may be barred by relevant statutes of limitation, most are not.\nShe  acknowledges the listed debts, save for one disputed one, and has recently petitioned for\nChapter 7 relief.  Whether she can achieve a successful discharge is not entirely predictable, but\npromising.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines where the individual applicant is so financially overextended that he or she is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts,\nwhich heretofore she has not been in a position to address, warrant the application of two of the\ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations: and DC\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and .DC 19(c)  (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).\nExtenuating circumstances are associated with Applicant\u2019s lack of sufficient income to cover\nher living expenses and student loan obligations.   Due to her periods of unemployment between\n2000 and 2002 and her relatively low levels of compensation returned from her current work, she\nhas barely been able to keep up with her current expenses.  Her available income sources have not\nbeen enough to address her older debts, some of which are quite large   Her three major debt\ndelinquencies alone exceed $19,000.00 and are simply too large to permit any kind of effective debt\nconsolidation.   MC 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline  (the conditions that resulted in\nthe behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual\nacted responsibility) has some applicability to Applicant\u2019 situation.  Her purchase of a new or almost\nnew Malibu automobile in 2004 raises some questions about her living beyond her means, given her\nfinancial circumstances at the time.  For the most part, though, her financial history reflects a young\nsingle parent struggling to better herself with enhanced educational skills.\nBecause of the limited income available to Applicant over the past six years, Applicant has\nnot heretofore been in a position to address her old debts.  Several of Applicant\u2019s listed debts were\nplaced in collection before 2004, but only one before 2002.  The remaining debts have been charged\noff since January 2004. None of Applicant\u2019s listed debts reflect any collection action by the\nindividual creditors involved.  Based on this record, only one of Applicant\u2019s debts (i.e., creditor 1.n)\nappear to be barred from collection by the pertinent six-year statute of limitation in Arizona.  See\n\u00a712-548 of A.R.S. (2007).  While statutes of limitation in general are considered important policy\ntools for discouraging plaintiffs from pursuing stale claims and promoting finality in litigation, they\nhave never been equated with good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors.  See, e.g.,  ISCR Case\nNo. 02-30304, at 3 (App. Bd. April 2004)(quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020, at 5-6 (App. Bd. June\n2001).  Still, there are no indications that any of these listed creditors still have any collection interest\nin Applicant.\nTo be sure, Applicant does not assert relevant statutes of limitation in Arizona in her defense.\nShe fully acknowledges most of her debts and disputes the legitimacy of just one of her debts: her\n\n6\nlandlord debt (creditor 1.f).  With her limited income and relatively high expenses as a single parent,\nshe is simply not in a position to make either individual or collective progress (such as use of debt\nconsolidation) on her listed debts.  Faced with no viable alternatives, she petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy relief following her receipt of the SOR.  While she has not been able to document her\ncompliance with bankruptcy petition requirements covering counseling and income/means testing,\nit is likely that the bankruptcy court will afford her some latitude, in this, a no-asset case, when she\nappears for her first creditors meeting.  Her achievement certificates from her employer place her in\nhigh regard and attest to her integrity and trustworthiness.  Considering the extenuating circumstances\nof Applicant's accumulated debts, the trust she inspires in her work, and  her efforts to discharge her\ndebts with the only realistic program available to her at this time, risks of her  not completing the\nbankruptcy she has initiated appear to be minimal and manageable.\nApplicant's documented Chapter 7 petition is enough to justify application of one of the\nmitigating conditions to her financial situation.  MC 20(d) of the guidelines for financial\nconsiderations (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) has some beneficial application for Applicant.  Her failure to document any\nbankruptcy-related counseling, however, precludes her reliance on MC 20(d) (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control) of the guidelines.\nHolding a favorable trustworthiness determination involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.   Financial stability\nin a person cleared to access information covered by privacy rights is required precisely to inspire\ntrust and confidence in the holder of the trustworthiness determination. \nBased on her documented initiation of Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief to discharge her old debts\nand the whole person level of trust she has demonstrated in fulfilling her responsibilities at work,\ngaining college credits, and caring for her family as a single parent, Applicant is able to demonstrate\nthe level of overall personal accountability and responsibility necessary to mitigate  the Government's\ntrust concerns.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, the positive judgment and trustworthiness impressions she has made on her\nfriends and colleagues, and her current bankruptcy initiatives, she mitigates trustworthiness concerns\nrelated to her debts.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by the\nfinancial considerations guideline.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2.2\nfactors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, conclusions and\nguidelines listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following formal findings:\n\n7\nFINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras . 1.a through 1.o:\nFOR APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted. \nRoger C.

He also has\n\n2\na history of criminal violations (mostly minor) lasting from 1987 to 1999.  He falsified answers to\nthree questions on his May 2006 security clearance application.  Mitigation has not been adequately\nestablished.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.\nOn March 23, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the basis of the written record.  A File\nof Relevant Material (FORM) was issued on May 8, 2007.  Applicant was informed that any response\nto the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days of receipt.  A timely response to the FORM\n(RFORM) was received at DOHA on or about May 18, 2007,  to which Department Counsel did not\nobject. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 49-year-old painter for  a defense contractor.  The December 9, 2005 SOR\ncontains eight (8) allegations under Guideline F (Financial), three (3) allegations under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), and five allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Applicant admitted\nallegations 1.a. - 1.g, and failed to answer allegation 1.h., under Guideline F.  He failed to respond\nto all three allegations under Guideline E; he admitted allegations 3.a - 3.d., and he failed to answer\nallegation 3.e., under Guideline J.  The FORM indicates that Applicant was notified of his omissions\nand was given a second opportunity and to respond.  In his response to the FORM (RFORM), he\ncorrected his earlier omissions and admitted all the previously unanswered allegations, 1.h., 2.a-2.c.,\nand 3.e.

Applicant was charged with Failure to Appear on Misdemeanor Charge on about\nSeptember 3, 2000, when he failed to appear or make the ordered payments.  The charge was\ndismissed when he subsequently made the required payments. Applicant admitted this allegation, but\nit does not allege the size of the fine or that it ever became delinquent.  Consequently, this allegation\nis found in favor of Applicant.  \n \n3.d. - Applicant was charged on June 19, 2003 with (1) Contempt of Court and (2) Obtaining\nUtility Service without Payment under $200.00.  He was found guilty of Count (2) and sentenced to\n60 days in jail, 55 days suspended.  There is no record the debt was ever paid.\nPOLICIES \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the\nfollowing nine generic factors: (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on\npage 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching\nmy overall conclusion.\nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nidentify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of\nwhether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d for an individual to hold a security\nclearance.  An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are\ndenied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving\nthose  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of\npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the\nDirective, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant.\n\n5\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\nat E2.2.2., \u201cany doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is a 49 year old male. \nGuideline F (Financial)  -The record establishes, without rebuttal, that Applicant incurred\nFederal Income tax debts in 1987, 1997, and 1998.  He also incurred numerous commercial\ndelinquent debts between 2000 and 2006.  Applicant has not demonstrated that any of these debts\nhave been paid off or otherwise resolved.\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and 19.( c)\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations, have been established by the Government\u2019s evidence of\nrecord.  No mitigating conditions have been are shown. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) - The record establishes, without rebuttal, that Applicant\ndeliberately falsified his answers to Questions 26, 38, and 39 of the SF 86, all of which were relevant\nand material to establishing his security clearance eligibility.\nDisqualifying Condition 16.(a). the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . has been shown, but no mitigating\nconditions have been demonstrated.   \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) - Applicant has admitted his history of criminal conduct in\n1979, 1998, 2000, 2003 and, lastly, in June 2005, when he falsified his SF 86 in violation of 18\nU.S.C. 1001, a felony.   \nDisqualifying Conditions 31.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and 31.( c)\nan allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted. \nThis is a case wherein an Applicant has chosen not to adequately respond to the Government\u2019s\nstated concerns by presenting any evidence in mitigation or extenuation.  Considering the findings\nof fact under all three specific Guidelines and the Directive\u2019s whole person concept, the Government\nhas established a prima facie case of ineligibility and Applicant has not come anywhere near\nmitigating the Government\u2019s stated concerns.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\n\n6\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 1.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 1.d.            \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph  l.e.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n              \nSubparagraph 1.f.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph  l.g.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 1.h.\n                                    Against the Applicant\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nAgainst the Applicant t\nSubparagraph 2.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 2.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 2.c.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n           \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a.           \nAgainst the Applicant\n                \nSubparagraph 3.b.               \nAgainst the Applicant\n            \nSubparagraph 3.c.           \n For the Applicant\n           \nSubparagraph 3.d. \n Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nBARRY M.

Since his discharge, he has\nperformed classified work for a defense contractor, compiling an excellent record. In 2005, during\nhis first six months of marriage, he committed a misdemeanor domestic assault during an argument.\nHe successfully completed a rehabilitation and anger management program, has a very good\nrelationship with his wife, and has had no further incidents. His omission of these matters from his\nsecurity clearance application was not deliberate. Applicant mitigated security concerns arising from\nhis criminal conduct, and his personal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant reapplied for a security clearance on February 28, 2006, in conjunction with his\nemployment by a defense contractor as a communications technician. On March 30, 2007, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended. The SOR detailed reasons, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG),  why DOHA could not make the\n1\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative\njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in a notarized letter dated April 9, 2007, and\nelected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. On May 15, 2007, the case was assigned\nto another administrative judge. The case was  reassigned to me on May 17, 2007. A notice of\nhearing was issued on June 6, 2007, and the hearing was held as scheduled on June 26, 2007. The\nGovernment offered 3 exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and\nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified, and offered 7 exhibits that were marked Applicant\nExhibits (AE) A through G, and admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr) on July 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of some of the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and\n1.b, pertaining to criminal conduct under AG J. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings\nof fact. He admitted answering incorrectly, but denied intentionally falsifying material facts\nconcerning his criminal history on his security clearance application as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and\n\nGE 1 (e-QIP security clearance questionnaire, dated Feb. 28, 2006) at 1, 18-19, 23-24; Tr at 23. \n2\nGE 3 (FBI Identification Record dated Mar. 22, 2006) at 1; Tr at 37-40, 50-54.\n3\nGE 2 (Applicant\u2019s DD-214); AE A, AE B (Reference letters dated Jun. 25 & 22, 2007); Tr at 23, 29-30, 40-42.\n4\nGE 1 at 13, 16-17; Tr at 57-58.\n5\nGE 3; Tr at 35-36, 42-49, 56-57. \n6\n3\n2.b. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration\nof same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to renew a security\nclearance he has held since he served on active duty in the Army from 1994 to 1998.   On July 12,\n2\n1993, right after he graduated from high school and before entering the Army, he was arrested while\ntrying to remove a suitcase full of ammunition from a school bus, on school grounds, that was being\nused for storage of excess school equipment. He explained that he was removing the ammunition\nbecause he thought it was being hidden there in connection with gang activity, and he wanted to\nprevent gang members from having access to it. He was charged with burglary and receiving known\nstolen property, both felonies. He pled guilty to, and was convicted of, misdemeanor charges of theft\nand tampering with a vehicle. He was sentenced to perform community service, which he completed,\nand to probation. The probation was dropped because he entered the Army.  \n3\nAfter serving honorably in the Army, where he earned an Army Commendation Medal, an\nArmy Achievement Medal, and a Good Conduct Medal, Applicant was discharged and began his\ncurrent employment. He maintained his security clearance and has had no security incidents or\nviolations. His work performance has been outstanding.  \n4\nApplicant married his wife in October 2004. Her 13-year-old daughter and their 2-year-old\nson live with them.  In March 2005, Applicant and his wife had an argument when he told her that\n5\nhe had looked at pornographic magazines in the past, but did not intend to do so in the future. She\nstruck him in anger, but he did not immediately respond. After about a half hour, he confronted her\nabout striking him, and in the ensuing argument he put his hands around her neck with sufficient\nforce to cause bruising. He was arrested and convicted for inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or\nco-habitant. His sentence included ten days in jail and three years probation. He successfully\ncompleted a year-long Batterer\u2019s Intervention Program of weekly two-hour sessions. After that and\na home visit, he was removed from supervised probation. He has been on unsupervised \u201ccourt\nprobation\u201d ever since, without further incident. This will expire in May 2008. He described his\ncurrent relationship with his wife as \u201cvery good.\u201d He reported the incident and resulting legal actions\nto his supervisor and employer immediately.  \n6\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to questions\n23(a) (\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?\u201d) and 23 (f) (\u201cIn the\nlast 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in\nresponse to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was\nalcohol or drug related.)\u201d). At the time, he did not recall that the 1993 incident initially involved\nfelony charges, and should have been listed in response to question 23(a). Since receiving the LOI,\n\nSee Applicant\u2019s response to the LOI, dated Apr. 9, 2007; Tr at 19-23, 52-53, 58. Note that he also (properly)\n7\nanswered no to question 23(b) concerning firearms or explosive offenses since violation of no such laws were involved\nin the incident. Tr at 53-54.\nTr at 37, 47-49, 54-56, 58-59.\n8\nAEs A, B, C; Tr at 28-31.\n9\nAEs D, E, F, G.\n10\nAG \u00b6 2.\n11\n4\nhe investigated and now realizes that he was originally charged with felony offenses before pleading\nguilty to, and being convicted of, the misdemeanors.  \n7\nApplicant began filling out GE 1 before his 2005 arrest for injuring his wife. At the time he\nchecked \u201cNo\u201d for question 23(f), that answer was true. By the time he and his company finally got\naround to completing the form and signing the certifications, he neglected to go back and change that\nanswer, as he candidly acknowledged he should have. He had promptly reported the incident to his\nemployer, and had no intention of deceiving the government about it. He freely disclosed the incident\nduring the interview process. He did not intend to conceal his police record in either instance, he\nmerely answered incorrectly by mistake.  Applicant\u2019s testimony in this regard was entirely credible.\n8\nApplicant presented testimony from his supervisor and mentor, as well as three letters of\nrecommendation. All spoke highly of his character, work performance, reliability, trustworthiness\nand loyalty.  He also presented a letter of appreciation and documentation concerning three\n9\nperformance awards he has earned at work.10\nPOLICIES            \nThe revised AG that replaced Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth adjudicative guidelines\nwhich must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory\nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions\n(DC) that may raise security concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate\nsecurity concerns. Applicable DCs and MCs must be considered in deciding whether to grant,\ncontinue, deny or revoke an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Conditions\nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate\nsecurity concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n11\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d All available, reliable information about the person, past and\n\nId., at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n12\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n13\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005); ?The Administrative Judge [considers] the record\n16\nevidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of\npertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n12\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n13\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d   \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n14\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n15\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n16\nA person seeking access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n17\n6\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section\n7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance\ndecision shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned,\u201d so the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAs set forth in the Regulation, every recommended personnel security decision must be a fair\nand impartial overall common sense decision based on all available evidence, both favorable and\n unfavorable.  The decision must be arrived at by applying the standard that the grant or continuance\nof a security clearance or access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security.  \nCriminal Conduct\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d   I have considered all the Guideline J Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions\n17\n(CCDCs) and find that only CCDC 31(a), (c), and (d) apply.  There is no information that would\ncause any other CCDC to apply.\nCCDC 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) applies because Applicant\nhas been convicted of two crimes. His theft conviction started as a felony case, but was reduced to\nmisdemeanor charges. His misdemeanor domestic violence conviction was serious enough to cause\nthe court to impose ten days in jail and three years on probation. Whether either of these standing\nalone would constitute a single serious crime need not be determined, since there was a second\nconviction, and the facts of the offenses speak for themselves in terms of security clearance concerns.\nThe 1993 offense demonstrated bad judgment by breaking and entering with the intention of\nconfiscating contraband ammunition, when he should have involved law enforcement authorities in\nthe confiscation. The 2005 offense demonstrated a lack of self-control. Each is of potential security\nconcern. \nCCDC 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d) applies as Applicant admitted to\ncommitting both offenses listed in the SOR. The security concerns raised are the same as those noted\nabove. \nCCDC 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d) also applies.  Applicant\u2019s three\nyears of supervised probation have been reduced to only one year, after he successfully completed\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n18\n7\nhis rehabilitation program, but he will still technically be on unsupervised probation until May 2008.\nHowever, there is nothing about the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s probation that raises any security\nconcerns independent of the underlying crime itself. It has served its purpose and been effective in\npreventing any recurrence.\nTwo of the Guideline J Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CCMCs) also apply.\nCCMC 32(a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies to Applicant\u2019s offenses, both individually\nand collectively. The 1993 offense occurred 14 years ago, when he was very young and naive. This\nis no longer the case. The 2005 offense occurred during the first 6 months of marriage, with a new\nbaby in the home, and before Applicant and his wife developed their communication and coping\nskills. Both have fully reconciled and their relationship now is very good. Applicant has developed\nhis anger management and stress There have been no further incidents over the past two years. This\none incident of losing self control was out of character, and given the intervening time and changed\ncircumstances, no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment. The two\noffenses were so different, and occurred so many years apart, that they do not reflect a pattern of\ncriminality or disregard for following laws, rules and regulations.\nCCMC 32(b) (\u201cthe person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life\u201d), and CCMC 32(c) (\u201cevidence that the person\ndid not commit the offense\u201d) do not apply.  There was no pressure or coercion to cause him to\ncommit either the theft offense or the assault, which was not in immediate response to his wife\nhitting him, but occurred a half hour later. Applicant admitted that he did commit the offenses.\nFinally, CCMC 32(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement\u201d)\nfully applies. He learned his lesson from the theft conviction, and has done nothing remotely similar\nsince. He successfully completed the Batterer\u2019s Intervention Program, has found successful coping\nskills, and has a very good relationship with his wife. He was demonstrably remorseful about having\nassaulted her, and has an excellent employment record.\nPersonal Conduct\n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d18\nApplicant did not remember that his 1993 offense originally involved felony charges when\nhe completed his security clearance application. He completed the question on which he should have\nlisted his 2005 offense before that offense occurred. He did not update the answer before signing the\nform, but that was through oversight and not with any intent to deceive either his employer or the\n\nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n19\n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving\nfalsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge\nto conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden\nof persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9,\n2004)).\n8\ngovernment. His employer was fully informed, and he freely discussed the incident during the\ninterview process. The Regulation\u2019s personal conduct guideline requires deliberate omission,\nconcealment or falsification of relevant and material facts to establish Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (PCDC) 16(a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form\nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d\n(emphasis added)), or PCDC 16(b) (\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority,\nor other official government representative\u201d (emphasis added)). Applicant\u2019s omission of  information\nabout his criminal history from his Security Clearance Application was not deliberate, but arose from\nmisunderstanding and inattention.   No other PCDC applies. \n19\nWhole Person Analysis \nI have considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability\nin protecting our national interests. He committed a misdemeanor theft offense, at which  he was\ncaught in the act, when he was just out of high school, some 14 years ago. Two years ago, he\ncommitted a misdemeanor domestic violence offense under stressful circumstances during the first\nsix months of his marriage. He successfully completed a rehabilitation and anger management\nprogram, has not re-offended, and now has a very good relationship with his wife. These two\nincidents are sufficiently different in nature and motivation, and sufficiently separated in time, that\nthey do not demonstrate a pattern of criminality, or show inability or unwillingness to follow laws,\nrules and regulations. His omission of these incidents from his security clearance application was\nnot deliberately deceptive, and raises no security concerns. There is no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress, and recurrence is highly unlikely given his sincere remorse.\nAccordingly, I do find that Applicant has fully mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal\nconduct. It is clearly in the interest of national security to grant or continue his access to classified\nmaterial.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \n            Formal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMichael B. Ware, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nBetween 1999 and 2005, the police arrested Applicant six times. Three arrests related to\nfamily disputes, which the court dismissed in including two not guilty findings. Applicant\u2019s most\nserious arrest occurred in 2002. He entered an Alfred plea to misdemeanor charges, but still\nmaintains he did nothing wrong. The police twice arrested him for driving under the influence (DUI).\nThe court found him not guilty of the most recent his DUI arrest. His earlier DUI is more than three\nyears old. He has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns regarding his criminal conduct.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nThe SOR may be amended at the hearing by an Administrative Judge on his/her own motion, or upon motion\n1\nby Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted, or for other good\ncause. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17. More importantly, an unfavorable clearance decision cannot be made unless the applicant\nhas been provided with an SOR that is as detailed and comprehensive as the national security permits. See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.3. Here, an amended SOR would not have provided this Applicant reasonable notice that his alcohol consumption\nor personal relationship with his former wife would be a real issue of paramount concern in determining the outcome\nof his case. A SOR issued under Guideline G would have made it clear to the Applicant that the government had concerns\nas to whether there was a nexus between Applicant\u2019s prior alcohol related offenses and his level of alcohol consumption.\nikewise, a Guideline E allegation concerning his personal conduct towards his former wife would have made it clear that\n2\nOn March 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense,\neffective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge\nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On May 10,\n2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. \nThis matter was assigned to another administrative judge on June 14, 2007, who scheduled\na hearing on August 2, 2007 in Newport News, Virginia. At the beginning of the hearing, Applicant\nrequested counsel. The administrative judge continued the hearing until September 24, 2007.\nCounsel entered his appearance on behalf of Applicant on September 17, 2007 and requested the\nhearing be continued. Upon a showing of good cause, the administrative judge issued an Order on\nSeptember 18, 2007, continuing the hearing until October 15, 2007. Because of an emergency with\nthe administrative judge, DOHA reassigned this case to me on October 10, 2007. I conducted the\nhearing as scheduled in Williamsburg, Virginia. The government submitted six exhibits (GE), which\nwere marked and admitted into evidence as GE 1 through 6. Applicant submitted nine exhibits,\nwhich were marked and admitted into evidence as applicant exhibits (AE), A through I. Applicant\ntestified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 24, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nDuring cross-examination, counsel for the government sought to develop new evidence in\nregards to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his ex-wife on the issue of spousal abuse and his drinking\nhabits. Applicant\u2019s counsel objected. The government did not allege that Applicant\u2019s past or present\nalcohol consumption was a current security concern under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) nor\nthat spousal abuse was a security concern under Guideline E. Although the government sought to\ndevelop new evidence to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR), it failed to make a proffer of the\nspecific evidence that it planned to illecit. Accordingly, the government did not articulate the new\nallegations that would be outlined in the amended SOR. Essentially, the government wanted to\nembark on a fishing expedition. To allow the development of new allegations would have violated\nApplicant\u2019s due process rights of notice and opportunity to respond to these new allegations.1\n\nthe government also had concerns about his conduct towards her. Similarly, if the government intended to present\nevidence of additional criminal conduct, then it should have disclosed those security concerns in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated May 10, 2007, at 1.\n2\nId.\n3\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance (SF-86)) at 2, 6-7, 9, 12-13; AE I (Documents from\n4\nLittle League); Tr. at 22-25.\nGE 1, supra note 4, at 9, 12-13; Tr. at 42-43.\n5\nGE 2 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information\n6\nServices Division) at 2.

This\n2\nadmission is incorporated as a finding of fact. He denied the remaining allegations.  After a complete\n3\nreview of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is 47 years old. He started work for his current employer, a Department of Defense\ncontractor, in 1978. For the last 20 years, he worked as a nuclear engineer. Since 1990, he has held\na low level security clearance, as his duties require him to review security documents on a daily\nbasis. In his 28 years of employment, he has never been disciplined for any reason at work, and there\nare no allegations of violation of security procedures. For the last 12 years, he has coached little\nleague and high school fast pitch baseball. He has never been investigated or charged for any\ninappropriate actions as a coach.4\nApplicant married in 1983 and divorced in April 2004. His three children from this marriage\nare 23, 21 and 19 years of age. He remarried in January 2006.5\nIn 1999, Applicant and his first wife got into an argument. His wife stood about six feet from\nhim. She threw a small pan or pail at him, which he deflected with his hands. The pan or pail then\nhit his wife. His wife did not sustain any injuries in this incident, which did not involve alcohol. He\nleft the house. She filed a complaint with the magistrate, who asked him to remain away from the\nhouse for two to three weeks, which he did. Applicant and his wife appeared for the hearing in this\nmatter in Juvenile and Family Court. When the court did not call their case, they learned that they\nhad appeared on the wrong day. They immediately walked to the police station and advised the\npolice about the mix up on their hearing dates. Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal\nrecords for Applicant indicates a contempt of court arrest in April 1999 for his failure to appear,\nApplicant never saw a contempt of court Order, and did not become aware of such an Order until\nDOHA investigator told him about it. The record contains no other information on the contempt of\ncourt issue. At his trial in May 1999, Applicant voluntarily agreed to attend the \u201cPRIDE\u201d program,\na relationship building program. He completed the 26 week program, which he described as an\nenlightening and helpful course on how to interact with people. The docket sheet indicates that\nthereafter, the court dismissed the charges after a finding of not guilty.6\n\nGE 3 (Court information sheet); GE 4 (Court information sheet); Tr. at 35-39, 59-64.\n7\nAE B (Court docket sheet); AE C (Court docket sheet); Tr. at 26-27, 66-68, 81-82.\n8\nGE 2, supra note 6, at 2; GE 5 (Court case information sheet) at 1; AE F (Final report from alcohol safety\n9\nprogram, dated January 24, 2005); Tr. at 27-28, 77.\n4\nIn September 2002, Applicant drove to a local karaoke bar to listen to friends sing. After one\nand one-half hours, he left. A woman asked for a ride home. He drove her to a furniture store parking\nlot, next to her home. He parked his car, a mini van. While sitting in the car, he observed in his rear\nview mirror an individual dressed in nondescript clothing approaching his car on the left with a big\nchain and a gun. He thought he was being set up for a robbery and feared for his life. He started his\ncar and drove away. He drove about 100 yards and turned left at a light. He saw police car lights and\ncar. He stopped and got out of his car and waited for the police. The police who arrived at this time\nwere in uniform. Before talking with him, the police threw him on the ground and began beating\nhim, resulting in injuries and bruising. The police then arrested him and charged him with eluding\na police officer and assault and battery on a police officer, both felony charges. On advice of counsel,\nApplicant entered an Alford plea (he voluntarily, knowingly and understandingly consented to the\nimposition of a prison sentence, but did not admit his actions constituted a crime) to simple assault\n(this offense lacked the element of assault on a police officer) and eluding a police officer,\nmisdemeanor offenses. The court sentenced him to 12 months in jail, which it suspended, and fined\nhim $1,078. He agreed to the Alford plea to avoid the risk of trying the case, which had a more\nserious potential for an adverse result from a contested trial. At the hearing, he emphatically denied\nstriking a police officer or running from the police. He drove away to protect himself from harm.7\nJust prior to finalizing their divorce, in January 2004, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a criminal\ncomplaint, alleging threatening and harassing phone calls. The police then arrested and charged him\nwith two misdemeanor counts of threatening and annoying telephone calls. Applicant called his wife\nseveral times to discuss discipline of their children after his wife had allowed their teenage children\nto have socials in the home without adult supervision. They disagreed about this issue. He recalls\nspeaking loudly and sharply about this issue. The court dismissed these charges in June 2004.8\nIn April 2004, Applicant drank at a celebration at work. He then left work and drove while\nunder the influence of alcohol, which he admits was a mistake. The police arrested him and charged\nhim with DUI, a misdemeanor offense. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to six months\nin jail, which was suspended, fined him $250, directed he attend a state alcohol and safety program,\nand pay $174 in costs. The court also restricted his driving privileges to driving to and from and to\nother work assignments as needed for one-year. Applicant complied with all the terms of his\nsentence.9\nIn 2004, Applicant purchased a car for his then 18-year-old daughter. She signed a contract,\nwhich outlined terms and conditions for her use of this car, including using the car to go to school.\nShe also verbally agreed that if she did not comply with the terms of the contract, she could not drive\nthe car. By November 2004, his daughter stopped going to school as agreed. To prevent her from\ndriving the car, Applicant removed the spark plugs from the car. His daughter then filed a criminal\n\nAE E (Court docket sheet on case) at 1-2; AE F (Contract with daughter); Tr. at 29-31.\n10\nAE H (Court trial order, dated October 6, 2005) at 1; Tr. at 40-42, 70-71,78-79.\n11\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n12\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n13\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v.

He pled not guilty\nto the charge, and the court found him not guilty and dismissed this case on March 11, 2005.10\nIn January 2005, Applicant and his fiancee drove to a restaurant and bar in his van, where\nthey met a friend of his. While at the restaurant, he drank alcohol. When they returned to his van,\nthey could not drive the van because transmission stopped operating. His friend offered Applicant\nhis truck to drive. Applicant\u2019s fiancee rode to his friend\u2019s house to drop off the friend and return to\nthe restaurant parking lot with the truck, as Applicant would not drive since he had been drinking.\nApplicant waited in his van. Because it was cold, he turned on the engine and fell asleep. While he\nwas sleeping in his van, the police came. The police tapped on his window, asked him to get out, put\nhim in the police cruiser, and took him to the police station. The police charged him with DUI, first\noffense. In court, Applicant pled not guilty to the charge and the court found him not guilty of\ndriving under the influence.11\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive.12\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n13\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n15\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd., Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n16\nclearance decision.17\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n18\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n19\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n20\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n21\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder Guideline J, criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. By its nature, criminal activity calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30) Between 1999 and 2005, the\npolice arrested Applicant on six occasions and charged him with felony or misdemeanor criminal\noffenses. Thus, DC \u00b6 31 (a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses and DC \u00b6 31 (c)\nallegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted or convicted apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, thrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\n7\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures\nare no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\nIn 1999, Applicant and his wife got into an argument. She threw a pan or pail at him which\nhe deflected, causing it to hit his wife. Although she sustained no injury, she filed a domestic\nviolence charge against Applicant, which the family court, not the criminal court, adjudicated. The\ncourt resolved this case, by asking Applicant to participate in PRIDE, a relationship building course.\nOnce applicant completed this informative and helpful course, the family court dismissed the charges\nagainst him. No further incidences of this type have occurred between Applicant and his now former\nwife. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns regarding this arrest under MC \u00b6 32 (a)\nbecause this incident took place more than eight years ago and is unlikely to reoccur as he and his\nwife have divorced, which has minimized the chances for fighting. Given Applicant\u2019s denial of any\nknowledge of a criminal contempt Order and the lack of documentary evidence showing the issuance\nof an Order by the court, Applicant has mitigated this allegation under MC \u00b6 32 (c).\nApplicant has also mitigated his criminal conduct and guilty finding for the 2002 incident\nunder MC \u00b6 32 (a). I decline to apply collateral estoppel in regard to his misdemeanor conviction.\nThe Appeal Board articulated a four-part test for applying collateral estoppel in such cases:\nFirst, the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted must have been afforded\na \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate that issue in the earlier case. Second, the issues\npresented for collateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved against the\nopposing party in the first trial. Collateral estoppel extends only to questions\n\u201cdistinctly put in issue and directly determined\u201d in the criminal prosecution. Third,\nthe application of collateral estoppel in the second hearing must not result in\nunfairness. Federal courts decline to apply collateral estoppel where the\ncircumstances indicate a lack of incentive to litigate the original matter. \u201cPreclusion\nis sometimes unfair if the party to be bound lacked an incentive to litigate the first\ntrial, especially in comparison to the stakes of the second trial.\u201d The arguments for\nnot giving preclusive effect to misdemeanor convictions are that an individual may\nnot have the incentive to fully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there is so\nmuch less at stake, or that plea bargains create an actual disincentive to litigate these\nparticular issues. ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 8 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006). (Citations\nand parentheticals omitted)\nIn this case, following a offer to plea to a reduced charge and no jail time by use of an Alford\nplea, Applicant lacked incentive to fully litigate the issues of his innocence of the felony charges\nagainst him. Applicant credibly testified that he drove away when an unidentified individual\napproached his parked car with a gun drawn and he feared for his life. Unbeknownst to him, the\nindividual was a plain clothes police officer. The state agreed to allow him to enter an Alford plea\n\n8\nto misdemeanor charges, which raises questions about the strength of the state\u2019s felony case. Because\nthe state allowed him to plea to simple assault without any reference to assaulting a police office,\nhis plea provides credibility to his version of events. To avoid the risks connected with a trial,\nApplicant followed his counsel\u2019s recommendation and entered an Alford plea. By so doing, he ended\nthe stress and trauma connected with a trial and continued to maintain his innocence. It would be\nunfair to apply collateral estoppel to Applicant based on these facts.\nThe facts surrounding this arrest are unique and not likely to occur again. Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to flee the parking lot under the circumstances described does not cause doubt on his\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He made a split-second decision to protect his life in\na situation he perceived as very dangerous. His actions are not criminal conduct or even misconduct.\nAs such, the 2002 incident does not cause a security concern.\nThe police arrested Applicant twice for DUI. The court found him guilty of the first DUI and\nnot guilty of the second DUI. In light of the not guilty finding in 2005, as well as his credible\nstatement that he was not driving and only using the vehicle\u2019s heater, establish he has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concern about this DUI under 32 \u00b6 (c). After his first DUI in 2004, Applicant chose\nnot to drink and drive, a decision he made because of the information he learned while in the alcohol\nsafety program. He has had no other convictions for DUI and only one subsequent arrest. At the time\nof his second DUI arrest, he was waiting for his fiancee to come and drive him home because he had\nbeen drinking. There is little likelihood that Applicant will be arrested for DUI in the future. It has\nbeen over three years since his DUI conviction after drinking. He has mitigated the government\u2019s\nconcerns under MC \u00b6\u00b6 32 (a) and 32 (d).\nThe police arrested him twice as a result of disputes with family members over discipline.\nApplicant became concerned when his wife allowed their teenage children to have social gatherings\nin their home with their friends and without adult supervision. He and his former wife argued about\nher decision. She did not like his position and apparent criticism of her. As a get even tactic, she filed\na complaint alleging harassing and annoying telephone calls by Applicant. Applicant\u2019s description\nof his relationship with his former wife is credible. The court\u2019s dismissal of these charges is one\nindication that he did not commit the alleged criminal conduct. As to the criminal property damage\ncharge, the court found him not guilty of any crime in the disciplining of his daughter. He did not\nuse physical force in either of these incidents. Rather, both incidents resulted from displeasure or\ndisagreement with his approach to issues. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nregarding these arrests under MC \u00b6 32 (c). I find that Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s\nconcerns about his criminal conduct under Guideline J.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nmust consider the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in protecting\nour national interests. Under the whole-person concept, I must consider the following factors listed\nin the Directive: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\n\n9\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. AG \u00b6 2 (a)(1)-(9).\nApplicant has worked for his present employer for 28 years. He has never been disciplined\nat work nor has he ever violated security procedures. The SOR lists six arrests for Applicant over\na six-year period of time, thus, raising a question of whether Applicant has a pattern of criminal\nconduct. His first arrest was resolved in family court, not criminal court, because family court has\ndeveloped expertise in helping resolve family issues before the issues develop into serious criminal\nproblems. In Applicant\u2019s case, the court offered him an opportunity to participate in PRIDE, a\nrelationship building course, and he did. As a result of this program, Applicant developed new skills\nfor managing family situations. The arrests in January and November 2004 occurred not because\nApplicant committed a crime, but because he and family members disagreed over discipline and\nadult supervision of teenagers.\nApplicant\u2019s 2002 arrest occurred under a very unique set of circumstances. He drove away\nfrom an armed individual approaching him as he feared for his life. He later found out this individual\nwas a police officer. Although he stopped and waited for the police a short distance away from where\nhe had been parked, the police manhandled him before talking with him, then arrested and charged\nhim with two felonies, eluding the police and assaulting a police officer. The police interpreted his\nactions as a sign of criminal conduct and reacted accordingly. He vehemently denies any\nwrongdoing, including assaulting a police officer, despite his decision to enter an Alford plea, not\nto felony charges but to misdemeanor charges of eluding a police officer and simple assault. He\nchose the Alford plea after much discussion with his counsel, instead of proceeding forward with\nan expensive, emotional, and stressful trial, with an uncertain outcome.\nApplicant has acknowledged that he drank and drove in 2004, and he should not have done\nso. He credibly testified that after attending the alcohol safety program, he no longer drinks and\ndrives. His testimony is supported by the fact that in 2005, after drinking, he decided that his fiancee\nshould go with his friend to obtain transportation and he would wait at his disabled van for her to\nreturn with the transportation. His DUI arrest in 2004 is his only DUI arrest, as the court found him\nnot guilty of the second DUI charge.\nAlthough he has been arrested six times, Applicant does not have a pattern of criminal\nconduct because three of his arrests arose from family disputes, which were resolved in family court\nor dismissed by the courts without any finding of criminal conduct. His most recent arrest resulted\nin a not guilty finding by the court. While it may be argued that his two remaining convictions are\nenough to show a pattern, his 2002 case involved a rather unique set of facts, which are not likely\nto occur again. His only DUI conviction occurred more than three years ago. He learned about the\ndangers of drinking and driving from his alcohol education program and has applied the values from\nthis program to his everyday life. He no longer drinks and drives.\nApplicant has demonstrated that he is not vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, pressure or\nduress because these arrests. He has learned from his mistakes and will not repeat this conduct in the\nfuture. He is a hard working employee with a good record. He is happily married to his second wife.\nHaving weighed all the evidence of record and used a common sense evaluation of the entire facts\n\n10\nin this case, I find that he has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns. Accordingly, I find in\nfavor of Applicant under Guideline J.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline J :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-f: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on December 15, 2005 (Government Exhibit 1).  On January 3, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 31, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non March 20, 2008.  I received the case assignment on March 25, 2008.  DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on May 16, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May\n20, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were\nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n2\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, without objection.  Pursuant to her request, the record\nwas left open for the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  On June 4, 2008,\nthe Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I, which was received without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing on June 3, 2008. The record closed on\nJune 4, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 49 and single.  She is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant denied this allegation because the allegation\nmistakenly said that a vehicle was repossessed.  This alleged past due debt for\n$4,370.00 actually concerns a timeshare that the Applicant purchased with her then\npartner.  The partner refused to pay her part of the timeshare costs, and the timeshare\nwas repossessed.  The Applicant\u2019s testimony was very vague as to whether she\ncurrently owed any money on this debt or not.  (Transcript at 23-32.)  \nThe credit report dated December 30, 2005 is the only one of four credit reports\nthat refers to this debt.  It says, \u201cMerchandise was taken back - may be a balance due.\u201d\n(Government Exhibit 3.)  (Emphasis supplied.)  In addition, this entry shows no past due\namount. \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant denied this allegation concerning a $40.00\nmedical debt.  The Applicant testified that she had asked her father to pay this debt for\nher in about 2006 and believes that he had paid the debt.  (Transcript at 31-32.)  For\nreasons set forth under \u201cAnalysis,\u201d below, I find this testimonial evidence to be truthful\nand worthy of belief.\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant originally denied owing this debt for\n$10,972.00.  She subsequently was able to determine that it was her debt.  The\nApplicant made arrangements to pay this debt in two installments and did so.  The\ncreditor indicates that this debt has been \u201csettled in full.\u201d  (Transcript at 32-36;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits E and I.)\nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant has consistently denied owing this $1,175.00\ndebt to a bank.  She believes it to be the result of identity theft committed by her former\npartner.  (Transcript at 37-38; Government Exhibit 2 at 3.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant denied owing this $137.00 medical debt in her\nAnswer.  She testified, \u201cI think I made the payment on that, but I can\u2019t find the\n\n3\npaperwork.\u201d  (Transcript at 38.)  Government Exhibits 5 and 6, credit reports dated\nMarch 19 and May 16, 2008, respectively, state that this debt is \u201cPaid Collection.\u201d\nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of\n$10,361.00.  She testified that only recently had she been able to find the collection\nattorney handling this account.  The Applicant\u2019s partner is willing to pay this debt.\n(Transcript at 34-36; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit I at page 5 shows that she has been in touch with this creditor\nsince the hearing.  The exhibit shows that the Applicant has made arrangements to\nsettle this account for $5,698.38, no later than June 16, 2008.  For reasons stated under\n\u201cAnalysis,\u201d below, I find this statement to be truthful and worthy of belief.    \nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A consists of four letters.  Two are from her Field Service\nManager and Company Vice President.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 1-2.)  Her manager\nstates, \u201cShe is a hard working and very punctual employee who has earned the trust of\nevery supervisor she has worked for while performing [her job].\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A\nat 1.)\nTwo friends describe the Applicant as \u201chonest,\u201d \u201cdependable\u201d and \u201chard working.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 3-4.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report and budget (Government Exhibit 6;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C) shows that she is taking control of her financial situation.  She\ntestified that she has no outstanding bills and is able to live within her means.\n(Transcript at 39.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\n\n4\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe Applicant testified at great length about her financial situation, and submitted\nwritten evidence following the hearing.  For the following reasons I find her testimonial\nevidence, as well as her documentary evidence, to be credible and worthy of belief.\nFirst, the Applicant freely admitted the debts that she does owe.  Second, the Applicant\nadmitted at the hearing that two debts, which she thought were the same, had turned\nout to be different.  Third, the Applicant fulfilled promises made at the hearing to make a\npayment on one debt and contact the creditor in another debt.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG &\n19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly\nunder AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security\nconcerns.  The evidence shows, and the Applicant admits, that she had some problems\npaying her bills in the past.  The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Evidence that Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts@ is mitigating under \u00b6\n20(d).  The Applicant successfully showed that she has paid the debts in allegations 1.c.\nand 1.e.  In addition, she credibly testified that she had asked her father to pay the\n$40.00 medical debt and believed that he had paid it (1.b.), and that she had made a\npayment arrangement regarding the only open debt (1.f.).  I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition applies.\nFinally, \u00b6 20(e) states that it may be mitigating where \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  The Government has not met its\nburden to show that the Applicant owes any money with regards to subparagraph 1.a.,\nsince the only credit report concerning that debt says that there \u201cmay be a balance due.\u201d\nIn addition, as set forth at length above, with regards to a bank and its collection\nagencies, she has consistently denied owing them money due to her former partner\nstealing her identity (1.d.).  For the reasons stated above, I find this denial to be credible\nand worthy of belief.  This mitigating condition clearly applies to the facts of this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\n\n6\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has had some credit\nproblems in the past.  She has worked hard to pay these debts off, and her current\nfinancial situation is solid.  She has consistently stated her concerns with the debts she\nfeels she does not owe.  With regard to all the debts alleged in the SOR, I find that she\nhas behaved reasonably and appropriately in trying to resolve them.  Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is\nclose to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on December 10, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to\nthis Administrative Judge on February 4, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nFebruary 11, 2008, scheduling the hearing for March 5, 2008.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented five exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5.\nThe Applicant presented three exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C.\nThe Applicant also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non March 14, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 30 years old and single.  He holds a Bachelors of Science\ndegree in Mechanical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nMechanical Engineer and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant started consuming alcohol at family gatherings at the age of\neighteen.  By the age of twenty-one, his use of alcohol had increased to five beers\nabout once every weekend.  This pattern continued for about a year until he decided\nthat he needed to focus on school.  Although his drinking did not occur more frequently,\nwhen it did occur, he often drank to the point of intoxication.  During this early period of\nalcohol consumption, he also experienced a black out.  \nOn May 5, 2002, the Applicant was charged with Open Alcohol Container.  He\nwas found guilty and was fined $60.00.  The Applicant explained that he and some\nfriends went to a festival.  Instead of paying the charges to get in, they parked close to\nthe festival and opened their containers of hard liquor (tequila) when they were cited by\npolice.  This offense did not effect the Applicant\u2019s drinking habits whatsoever.  \nTwo months later, in July 2002, the Applicant was charged and arrested for (1)\nSexual Battery and (2) Sexual Arousal.  The Applicant stated that he and several\nfriends, including his girlfriend, were consuming alcohol in a public establishment.  The\nApplicant had consumed about two or three drinks when he went to the rest room.  As\nhe left the restroom, he bumped into a woman and continued walking by her.  The\npolice were contacted and the Applicant was accused of grabbing the woman\u2019s\nposterior.  The Applicant denied that it occurred, however he admits that he was\nunstable from the effects of the alcohol.  The charges were amended to Disturbing the\nPeace.  On September 4, 2002, he pled nolo contendere and was fined approximately\n$200.00.  He was placed on two years probation and a restraining order was in place for\nthree years.  (See Government Exhibit 4).  \nOn January 8, 2004, the Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Under\nInfluence Alcohol/Drug in Vehicle, and (2) 0.08% More Weight Alcohol Driving Vehicle.\nThe Applicant explained that he and some friends were consuming alcohol at a sporting\nevent.  The Applicant remembers drinking six, eight ounce beers.  He and his friends\nwalked to another bar and continued consuming alcohol. At this bar, the Applicant\nconsumed three more beers.  At some point, the Applicant\u2019s friends asked him for his\ncar keys because he was not coherent, as his speech was slurred and he was talking\nloudly. The Applicant complied and gave his car keys to a friend.  The Applicant later\nleft the bar, found a spare key in his wallet, and drove his car.  The Applicant indicates\nthat he was taking a weight loss drug at the time and it altered his ability to sense his\nlevel intoxication.  He pled nolo contendere to Charge (2), and was convicted of charge\n\n3\n(2).  He was ordered to complete a 6-month First Offender alcohol and drug education\nand counseling program.  His license was suspended for 90 days, he was fined\n$1,438.00, and he was sentenced to one day in jail.  Charge (1) was dismissed.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 3 and 4).\nThe Applicant testified that there were at least three or four other times that he\ndrove a vehicle while either intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol and he was not\narrested. \nOn March 18, 2006, the Applicant was charged with (1) Under Influence\nAlcohol/Drug in Vehicle and (2) 0.08% More Weight Alcohol Driving Vehicle.  It was the\nApplicant\u2019s birthday and he was on his way with some friends to a charity function.  A\nfriend convinced him to go to a local bar where the Applicant consumed four alcoholic\nbeverages.  The Applicant\u2019s friend and his friend\u2019s girlfriend got into an altercation and\nleft the bar.  The Applicant then went to go sit in his car for a while, but instead he drove\noff.  He pled nolo contendere to Charge (2), and was convicted of charge (2).  He was\nordered to complete an 18 month Second Offender alcohol and drug education and\ncounseling program, his license was suspended for one year, and he was fined\napproximately $1,511.00.  The Applicant currently remains on probation for this offense\nuntil June 2009.  Charge (1) was dismissed.  (See Government Exhibits 3 and 4). \nThe Applicant is currently working on completing the sentencing requirements\nimposed by the court as a result of his most recent conviction.  He has been attending a\nHospital and Morgue Program (HAM program) that he believes has had a profound\nimpact on him.  In a letter from the Applicant dated April 24, 2006, concerning the HAM\nprogram, the Applicant indicated that he was made aware of the consequences,\nincluding death, that can happen as a result of drunk driving.  The Applicant indicates\nthat the insidious nature of the vices that seemed harmless but had a tragic end were\ntoo much for him to handle.  At one point during the program, he fainted and was unable\nto finish the program.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  \nThe Applicant is currently twelve months into an eighteen month program.  The\nprogram consists of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings (AA), an alcohol education course,\nand individual counseling.  Since January 2007, he has attended 26 AA meetings.  He\nstopped attending because of the difficulty in getting to the meetings.  He has\ncompleted 26 of the 32 required group counseling sessions.  He is restricted to drive to\nwork and to drug and alcohol court mandated programs.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).    \nThe Applicant indicates that since he began consuming alcohol, his longest\nperiod of abstinence was for six months, following his DUI arrest in January 8, 2004.\n(Tr. P. 52). He also remained abstinent for two months following his most recent DUI in\nMarch 2006.  He admits that he normally keeps alcohol in the house.  He buys a case of\nbeer from Costco and keeps it until it is gone, and then buys another.  (Tr. P. 53).  He\ncontinues to maintain friendships with people that he has consumed alcohol with, as\nthey are good friends of his.  (Tr. P. 57).  \nTwo weekends before the hearing the Applicant consumed a beer with his\ngirlfriend when they went to dinner at a restaurant.  (Tr. p.  49).  The Applicant believes\nthat he has had a problem with alcohol.  Presently, however, he believes that he has\n\n4\nmade some changes to correct his problem.  He no longer drinks and drives and does\nnot over indulge.  (Tr. p.  50).  He does not believe that total sobriety is the solution for\nhim.  (Tr. P. 51).  His parents, family and friends have expressed concern about his\nalcohol consumption.      \nMitigation.\nA letter from the Director of the company for which the Applicant is employed,\ndated March 4, 2008, indicates that the Applicant has been an exemplary employee.\nHe has worked on a number of highly visible and critical assignments.  The quality of his\nwork product has been of the highest standard and his overall performance has been of\na substantive benefit to the company.  The Applicant is considered to be a highly\nreliable and trustworthy employee.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nApplicant\u2019s progress report from the Safety Education Center dated October 30,\n2007, estimates the date the Applicant will complete the alcohol education program as\nJuly 29, 2008.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n30.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n30.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22.(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\n22.(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the\nfollowing general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\n\n6\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G) and criminal conduct (Guideline\nJ).  The totality of this evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the\nApplicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security\nclearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines J and G of the SOR.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, disqualifying Conditions 30.(a) a single\nserious crime or multiple offenses, and 30.(c) allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted apply.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  The same conduct\nalleged under Guideline J is applicable under Guideline G.  \nUnder Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, disqualifying conditions, 22.(a)\nalcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent and 22.(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\n\n7\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent apply.  I have considered mitigating condition 23(a)., and  decide that\nit does not apply because, viewed in its entirely, his conduct does cast doubt on his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  Accordingly, none of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has consumed alcohol at times to excess\nand to the point of intoxication over the past twelve years.  As a result of his alcohol\nabuse he has been cited, arrested, charged and convicted of various alcohol related\nincidents, the most recent of which occurred in 2006 for DUI.  He currently remains on\nprobation for this offense until June 2009, and is on a restricted driver\u2019s license.  The\nonly alcohol counseling he has received has been court ordered.  Although the\nApplicant has not been formally diagnosed as an alcoholic, his abusive drinking pattern,\nnumerous alcohol related incidents, and his inability to remain abstinent for any\nsignificant length of time is a strong indicator that he has a serious alcohol problem.  His\nparents, family and friends have expressed concern about his welfare and on one\noccasion his friends have taken his car keys away from him to prevent him from driving.\nDespite all of this, the Applicant is in denial.  In order to battle his alcohol problem, he\nmust first admit to himself that he has a problem.  At the present time, he does not\nbelieve that he has a drinking problem.  In any event, the Applicant continues to drink\nalcohol and can easily overindulge at any moment.  I do not see a changed pattern of\nconduct that would guarantee prevention of this sort of abuse in the future.  His history\nof excessive alcohol abuse has not been mitigated by sufficient rehabilitation and\nreform.  Accordingly, Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption and Guideline J, Criminal\nConduct are found against the Applicant. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  \n This Applicant has a serious alcohol problem and has not stopped drinking.  He\nhas not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and he does not meet the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), and J (Criminal Conduct).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, and 2 of the SOR.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s father and brother are resident citizens of Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.a); his brother works as a research scientist for a forest research institute sponsored by the Taiwanese government (SOR \u00b6 1.c); his mother is a Taiwanese citizen living with him in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.c); Applicant traveled to China in 1997, 1998, and twice in 1999 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and he resided in Taiwan from 1998 through 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.e).

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEric A. Eisen, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a native of Taiwan, acquired U.S. citizenship in January 1997 after living in the\nU.S. since early 1982. From 1995 to 2005, he operated his own consulting business in the U.S. While\nhe provided translation services to a Taiwanese company maintaining a satellite ground station built\nby U.S. companies, he had several U.S. clients as well, and his work predated his U.S. defense\ncontractor employment. Applicant obtained a Taiwanese passport in about 1998 for convenience\nwhen traveling between the U.S. and Taiwan to care for his ill mother. The foreign preference\nconcerns are mitigated by the destruction of the Taiwanese passport with expressed renunciation of\nTaiwanese citizenship. Foreign influence concerns exist because of the Taiwanese residency and\ncitizenship of his father and brother, but Applicant is likely to resolve any conflict in favor of the\nU.S. where he and his mother make their home. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 30, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (foreign preference)\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant, acting pro se,\nanswered the SOR on May 2, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on June 14, 2007. Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance on\nJune 26, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on October 16, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Three government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-3 ) and ten Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-J) were admitted, and testimony was taken from\nApplicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 25, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn June 13, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC).  Authority to consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery,\nand evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner).\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative\nproceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No.\n02-24875 (decided Oct. 12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative\njudge who took  administrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case, and it was provided in\nadvance to that applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present alternative\ninformation for the judge to notice. On August 20, 2007, I granted Applicant until September 21,\n2007, to file any objections and/or submit alternative facts for administrative  notice. No response\nwas forthcoming by the due date. At his hearing, counsel for Applicant objected on the grounds of\nrelevance to the consideration of the criminal activities of other individuals, to the government\u2019s\n\u201cblending\u201d of Taiwan with the PRC given Taiwan is a multiparty democracy and the PRC a\ncentrally-controlled totalitarian state, and of the relevance of the PRC to his case.\nFacts are proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized\nsource and relevant and material to the case. For source documentation the government relied on\n\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated April 2007 (I), Background Note: China, dated January 2007 (VIII),\n1\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007 (XI), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated March 19, 2007 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n2\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (VII). The document was prepared for the\n3\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (III) and\n4\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (X). \nSee 2006 Report to Congress, November 2006 (IX).\n5\nThe April 18, 2006, press release (IV) concerns the sentencing of a U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade\n6\nsecret theft between December 1999 and December 2001 to the benefit of a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no\nevidence that Taiwan\u2019s government was involved in, or sanctioned the criminal activity. The January 22, 2007 (V) press\nrelease concerns the sentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for, in part, making false statements to the\ngovernment concerning his relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer and by not reporting that he had\ntraveled to Taiwan where he met with the foreign intelligence officer.\nSee U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005 (VI). The\n7\ncourt records do not pertain to any criminal charge against Applicant.\nThe press releases (IV) and (V) are hearsay and entitled to little weight in this case. While presented apparently\n8\nto substantiate that Taiwan actively pursues collection of U.S. economic and proprietary information, neither case\ninvolves Applicant personally.  Similarly, the wrongdoing of a former U.S. State Department official as set forth in the\nStatement of Facts filed in the U.S. District Court (VI) is relevant only to the extent it implicates a Taiwanese intelligence\nofficer in improper activity. There is no indication Applicant has ever been targeted.\nIn SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, DOHA incorrectly identified Taiwan as the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The\n9\nSOR was amended at the hearing to correctly designate Taiwan as  the Republic of China (ROC). There is no evidence\nthat Applicant is a citizen of the PRC, although his ex-spouse is a resident and citizen of the PRC.\n3\npublications of the Department of State;  the Congressional Research Service;  the Centre for\n1\n2\nCounterintelligence and Security Studies;  the National Counterintelligence Center, now known as\n3\nthe Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive;  the U.S. China Economic and Security\n4\nReview Commission;  two press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice;  and a record of the\n5\n6\nU.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.7\nI agreed to take administrative notice, noting that Taiwan and the PRC are viewed as separate\nentities by the U.S. State Department, notwithstanding the \u201cone-China\u201d policy. After weighing the\nreliability of the source documentation  and assessing the relevancy and materiality of the facts\n8\nproposed, I took administrative notice of certain facts as set forth below.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercises dual\ncitizenship with Taiwan and the United States (SOR \u00b6 1.a);  possessed an active Taiwanese passport\n9\nfrom about 1998 through February 1, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); resided in Taiwan from about 1998 through\n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); from about 1998 through 2005 served as owner/president of a U.S. consulting\n\n4\nfirm with clients in Taiwan, including a space program office that paid him about $5,000 in\nconsultant fees in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and he served in Taiwan\u2019s army from about 1978 through 1980\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s father and brother\nare resident citizens of Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 2.a); his brother works as a research scientist for a forest\nresearch institute sponsored by the Taiwanese government (SOR \u00b6 1.c); his mother is a Taiwanese\ncitizen living with him in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.c); Applicant traveled to China in 1997, 1998, and twice\nin 1999 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and he resided in Taiwan from 1998 through 2001 (SOR \u00b6 2.e).\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted he held an active Taiwanese passport from approximately\n1998 through February 1, 2007, that he served as owner/president of a U.S. sole proprietorship that\ndid business in Taiwan as alleged, and that he served in Taiwan\u2019s army from about 1978 to 1980.\nHe explained that he was hired as a consultant to provide translation services for technical\ndocuments needed to maintain and upgrade a ground station in Taiwan built by the U.S. He denied\nthe exercise of dual citizenship as he did not claim Taiwanese citizenship, and that while he had an\nextended stay in Taiwan due to his parents\u2019 health problems, he considered himself a resident of the\nU.S. where he owned his home. He indicated that he returned permanently to the U.S. in 2001 and\ndid not use his Taiwanese passport again before its destruction in 2007. Concerning the Guideline\nB allegations, Applicant admitted the Taiwanese citizenship and/or residency of his family members\nas alleged, his travels to China to see his spouse from whom he divorced 2001, and his brother\u2019s\nemployment as a research scientist in Taiwan. He denied residency in Taiwan as well as the\nimplications of foreign influence. Applicant indicated that his brother, who obtained his doctorate\ndegree in the U.S., plans to immigrate to the U.S. with his family in the future.\nAfter a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, and having\nagreed to take administrative notice, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old testing engineer who was born in Taiwan. His father and mother\nimmigrated separately from the PRC to Taiwan following the Communist takeover in 1949, and\nacquired Taiwanese citizenship. His father was an engineer for a private company in Taiwan before\nhe retired. Applicant was raised in Taiwan with his older brother, who was born in 1953. Applicant\npursued his undergraduate education in Taiwan, and was awarded a bachelor of science degree in\n1978.\n Granted a deferment until he completed his college studies, Applicant served compulsory\nmilitary service in the Taiwanese army as an ordnance lieutenant from about September 1978 to\nAugust 1980. He spent the year 1981 learning English and taking examinations in preparation for\ngraduate school in the U.S. From about January 1982 to March 1984, Applicant pursued master\u2019s\ndegree studies in mechanical engineering at a public university in the U.S. His time in the U.S. only\nserved to reaffirm a desire to live in the U.S. that he had held since before he came to the U.S. for\ngraduate school. On earning his degree in March 1984, he began a job search in the U.S. In 1985,\nApplicant began employment as a research engineer for a company in Silicon Valley, and he began\nusing an Anglicized first name. In January 1986 he began taking classes in controls and dynamics\ntoward his doctorate while working full-time.\nIn about 1987, his employer sponsored him for U.S. permanent residency, and Applicant\nbought a home in California. He put his father on the deed and mortgage as well just in case\nsomething was to happen to him. In 1991, Applicant got his \u201cgreen card.\u201d\n\nThe government alleged, and the name of the foreign firm suggests, that this was an official office of the\n10\nTaiwanese government. However, Applicant testified with no evidence to the contrary from the government that he\nunderstood from employees of the Taiwanese firm that they do not receive the benefits of the Taiwanese government\nemployees. Applicant took this to mean that the company was a contractor to the government tasked with maintaining\na satellite station built by a U.S. firm for the Taiwanese government. (Tr. 45, 86 )\n5\nIn 1990, Applicant\u2019s mother traveled from Taiwan to the PRC to see if she could find her\nsister and other family members left behind when she emigrated. While she was in the PRC, her\nefforts were aided by a PRC female citizen, then about 22 (born in 1968) years old, whom she\nthought would make a good match for Applicant. With the help of his mother, Applicant traveled\nto the PRC to meet her in about 1993. They continued to correspond and in August 1995, they\nmarried in the PRC. Applicant returned to the U.S. without her and he applied for her to immigrate\nto the U.S.\n.In 1994, Applicant\u2019s employer ceased operations. Applicant started his own consulting\ncompany from out of his home in the U.S., marketing his knowledge of Taiwanese culture and of\nmandarin Chinese to U.S. businesses. Over the 11 years of his company\u2019s existence, Applicant\u2019s\nclients were primarily U.S. firms needing assistance with their work with Taiwanese firms, although\nhalf of his business involved a private Taiwanese company engaged in contract work for the\nTaiwanese government.  Around 1995, Applicant learned by way of a newspaper advertisement that\n10\nthis Taiwanese company was looking for help in its dealings with U.S. companies involving a\nground satellite tracking station in Taiwan. Applicant was paid about $5,000 by the Taiwanese\ncompany for his consulting services between 1996 and 2001, consisting largely of identifying U.S.\nfirms with the products and/or expertise needed by the Taiwanese company in maintaining this\nsatellite station, translating into Chinese technical documents provided by the American builder of\nthe tracking station, and aiding employees of the Taiwanese firm on travel in the U.S. to work with\ntheir American counterparts.\nIn January 1997, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, taking an oath to renounce all\nforeign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or\nperform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant thought\nof himself as a U.S. citizen thereafter, even though he subsequently acknowledged on his security\nclearance application that he was a dual citizen of Taiwan and the U.S. and obtained a Taiwanese\npassport. Applicant acquired his U.S. passport on January 31, 1997.\nIn October 1997, Applicant traveled to the PRC for two weeks to visit his spouse. She was\ninvolved in her real estate career, and he had been unable to convince her to join him in the U.S.\nApplicant stopped off in Taiwan for business and to see his parents and brother during that trip.\nIn 1998, Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with hydrocephalus after she had lost the ability\nto walk. Applicant traveled on short notice to Taiwan because of his mother\u2019s illness and when told\nthat she would not live for more than two years, he elected to spend extended periods in Taiwan.\nOver the next three years, he traveled to the U.S. seven to eight times, staying two to four weeks per\noccasion, to deal with his house in California, which is rented out, and for business. When in\nTaiwan, he rented an apartment to give him some private space while caring for his parents.\nApplicant  traveled to the PRC in July 1998, and twice in 1999 (May and October) to see his spouse.\n\nApplicant could not recall when he renewed his Taiwanese passport. (Tr. 105)\n11\nAs of his e-QIP in late July 2005, Applicant was in the process of relocating from California to his current state\n12\nof residence. He provided his home in California as his mother\u2019s current residence, and indicated he was living in a hotel.\nHe also added that a friend in California was helping him care for his mother, so she likely stayed behind at his house\nin California while he made more permanent living arrangements in his present locale. It is not clear when she joined\nhim.\n6\nOut of concern that as a foreign visitor he would be at a disadvantage when obtaining timely\nhealth care for his elderly parents, and that his visa might expire when he needed to remain in\nTaiwan to care for his parents, Applicant relied on his Taiwanese birth and presumptive Taiwanese\ncitizenship to obtain a Taiwanese passport.  Applicant used this Taiwanese passport as recently as\n11\nSeptember 2001 when re-entering Taiwan following his  travel to the U.S. to deal with his house and\nbusiness.\nIn late Spring 2001, his mother had successful surgery to remove a brain tumor. Applicant\nreturned to the U.S. permanently in about September 2001, bringing his mother with him. He\nsponsored his mother for permanent residency in the U.S., which was granted to her in August 2003.\nHis father remained in Taiwan near Applicant\u2019s brother for health reasons. Once back in the U.S.,\nApplicant did not use his Taiwanese passport.\nIn early January 2002, Applicant\u2019s spouse came to the U.S. for the first time to ask him for\na divorce. Heavily involved in her real estate career, she had no intention of living in the U.S. To\nApplicant\u2019s understanding, his divorce, which was handled in the PRC, was final six months later.\nApplicant has had no contact with his ex-wife since her three-day visit in early 2002.\nSeeking employment stability and financial security so that he could care for his mother,\nApplicant accepted a position with his current employer in 2005. Applicant formally closed his\nconsulting business in June 2005, and he relocated across the country for the job. He initially resided\nin a residence inn until he found an apartment for him and his mother.12\nOn starting his job in July 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance for his duties as\na systems engineer. On an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) executed\non July 29, 2005, Applicant disclosed his dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S., his addresses\nin Taiwan when he was there from about January 1998 to September 2001, his former military\nservice for Taiwan before he came to the U.S., his self-employment, his travel to the PRC for\npleasure and to Taiwan for business and pleasure, his marriage to and divorce from a PRC resident\ncitizen, his mother\u2019s Taiwanese citizenship and U.S. residency as a \u201cgreen card holder,\u201d and the\nTaiwanese citizenship and residency of his father and his brother.\nOn February 1, 2007, Applicant turned in his Taiwanese passport to his facility security\nofficer (FSO) for destruction. By letter dated February 1, 2007, but not sent by Applicant until\nAugust 2007, Applicant informed the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) of the\ndestruction of his Taiwanese passport and of his renunciation of his Taiwanese citizenship.\nIn response to foreign preference interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant disclosed on\nFebruary 26, 2007, that he had received $5,000 in consultation fees from the Taiwanese firm likely\n\n7\naround 2001. He denied any current financial interests, benefits, or payments from a foreign country,\nbusiness, person, or organization, and estimated the value of his U.S. financial interests at $600,000.\nApplicant has not been back to Taiwan since he returned to the U.S. with his mother in\nSeptember 2001. He does not intend any future travel to Taiwan, except to attend his father\u2019s funeral.\nHis father is 88 years old and in poor health. He lives close to Applicant\u2019s brother and brother\u2019s\nfamily. Applicant is the primary caregiver for his mother, and his brother looks after their father in\nTaiwan. Applicant does not provide his father any financial assistance.\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a research agronomist who earned his doctorate degree from a\nuniversity in the U.S. in December 1990. He has been employed for about the last 30 years by a\ngovernment-funded forestry research institute in Taiwan whose mission is the preservation of forest\nresources. His job involves the routine survey of timber sites, measurement of tree growth and\nassessment of tree health, and research into timber planning and management. Applicant\u2019s brother\nis married to a teacher at a local private college in Taiwan. They have two children. Their 23-year-\nold son has a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting. He just started his  compulsory military service for\nTaiwan, and intends to pursue graduate study in the U.S. on his discharge. Their 17-year-old\ndaughter, a high school student, has U.S. citizenship because she was born in the U.S. in April 1990.\nShe held a U.S. passport from April 2000 to April 2005, and hopes to attend college in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s brother and his wife plan on retiring in about two to three years and immigrating to the\nU.S. It is Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s belief that his father will accompany them to the U.S. at that time if\nhe is still alive. Applicant\u2019s relatives (brother and his immediate family and father) visit him in the\nU.S. about once every other year. During their visits, designed in part to acclimate their father to the\nU.S., they explore different areas of the U.S. with a view to identifying where they would like to live\non their immigration.\nInitially on his return to the U.S. in 2001, and again when he relocated for his current job in\n2005, Applicant contacted his brother weekly by e-mail to reassure him that he could continue to\ncare for their mother. As of October 2007, the extent of Applicant\u2019s contact with his father and/or\nbrother was a telephone call and/or e-mail message a couple of times per year, usually on special\noccasions such as birthdays. His most recent contact was by telephone with his father in mid-\nSummer 2007.\nApplicant has no financial assets in Taiwan. He rents an apartment near his work, and\ncontinues to pay on a mortgage for his home in the U.S. The net equity in the home is about\n$500,000. Applicant hopes to retire someday to his home in California, so he rents out the property.\nAs of September 11, 2007, Applicant had $30,578.21 on deposit in a checking account in the U.S.\nApplicant put his brother\u2019s name on the account in case something should happen to him. Applicant\nrenewed his U.S. passport on April 27, 2007.\nAt work Applicant coordinates and supports integration and test efforts associated with an\nadvanced radar system that has high visibility within the company and its customers. A conscientious\nand attentive employee, Applicant is solid technically and produces quality work. He held an interim\nsecret clearance for his duties in 2006 and 2007 on a classified program that required frequent access\nto classified equipment and information. Applicant complied with the security classification guide\nfor the program. He has completed security training offered by his employer, including in protecting\ncompany trade secrets, information security awareness, and closed area security requirements.\n\n8\nOutside of work, Applicant has been a Special Olympics volunteer. He also mentors eighth\ngrade students on a weekly basis as part of his employer\u2019s initiative promoting education. Applicant\nplays tennis on weekends when he is not caring for his mother and he is active in his church. He\nemploys a woman to help him care for his mother.\nAdministrative notice was taken of the following facts. The government of Taiwan is a\nmultiparty democracy. The United States recognizes that there is only one China, that the\ngovernment of the PRC is the sole legal government of China, and that Taiwan is part of China.\nNonetheless, under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial relations with\nTaiwan. Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to sell appropriate\nmilitary defensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most important\ntrading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose primary mission is the\ndefense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has not renounced\nthe use of force against Taiwan. It is U.S. policy that the resolutions of disputes between Taiwan and\nChina be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power and a member of the World Trade\nOrganization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the U.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The\nU.S. State Department reports that Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human\nrights and create a democratic political system since ending martial law. In the past, organizations\nin Taiwan employed unlawful methods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence information.\nTaiwan was listed as an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence as of 2000. As recently as\n2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert relationship with a U.S. State\nDepartment official.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\n9\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). A native of Taiwan, Applicant came to the\nUnited States in about early 1982 for graduate study after completing compulsory military service\nfor Taiwan. Sponsored by his then employer, he acquired U.S. permanent residency in 1991. In\nJanuary 1997, he became a U.S. citizen. Even though he thought of himself solely as a U.S. citizen,\nhe knowingly exercised a privilege of his native Taiwanese citizenship by applying for and obtaining\na Taiwanese passport in about1998 so that he could stay in Taiwan for extended periods if necessary\nto care for his parents and to avoid any possible bureaucratic difficulties in obtaining needed health\ncare for his parents. While not intended as an act in preference for Taiwan, this voluntary acquisition\nand use of his Taiwanese passport after his U.S. naturalization raises serious foreign preference\nconcerns under disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a)(1), exercise of any right, privilege or obligation\nof foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the citizenship of a family member.\nThis includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s mandatory military service for Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.e), his residency in\nTaiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and his consultant activities for a Taiwanese defense firm (SOR \u00b6 1.d) do not\nraise current concerns of foreign preference. His foreign military service occurred when he was\nsolely a citizen of Taiwan, before he came to the U.S. for graduate school. DC \u00b6 (10)(a) (2), military\nservice or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country, is implicated only if the military service\nwas after he became a U.S. citizen. Applicant\u2019s home ownership in the U.S. notwithstanding, he\nspent most of his time in Taiwan from mid-1998 to September 2001, splitting his time between his\nparents\u2019 home and a rented apartment. Yet his motivation was to care for his parents, especially his\nmother who had been given two years to live, and it was not to meet citizenship requirements. DC\n\u00b6 10(a)(4), residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements, does not apply. Applicant\nwas paid $5,000 in consulting fees by a private Taiwanese firm that contracted with the Taiwanese\ngovernment in the maintenance of a ground satellite station built for Taiwan by U.S. companies, but\nthere is nothing to suggest that the business relationship was in conflict with the U.S. national\nsecurity interest. He learned about the Taiwanese company\u2019s need for translation services from a\nnewspaper, a source open to the public, was hired based on his merit and not on personal contacts,\nand ceased operations once he began working for his current employer. Accordingly, DC \u00b6 10(c),\nperforming or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of a\nforeign person, group, or organization, or government in conflict with the national security interest,\nis not pertinent.\nIn mitigation of the foreign preference concerns generated by his possession and use of a\ncurrent foreign passport, Applicant provided his foreign passport to his FSO and it was destroyed\nin February 2007. Mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 11(e), the passport has been destroyed, surrendered\nto the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated, applies. Any concerns that the DoD\nmay have had of Applicant reapplying for the foreign passport have been amply addressed by\nApplicant\u2019s notification to the TECO that he had renounced his Taiwanese citizenship and destroyed\nhis Taiwanese passport. Willingness to renounce dual citizenship is mitigating under \u00b6 11(b), the\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship. There is no evidence as of\nOctober 2007 that his unilateral actions are sufficient to revoke his Taiwanese citizenship, but\n\n10\nApplicant has done what he can to comply with DoD requirements and demonstrate a preference for\nthe U.S.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, foreign influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or\nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). Applicant\u2019s father and only sibling are resident citizens of Taiwan, a\ncountry with a history of favorable relations with the U.S., but also one that has targeted U.S.\nsensitive information. Applicant\u2019s mother, who lives with him in the U.S., is a citizen of Taiwan.\nShe is unlikely to acquire U.S. citizenship because of the language barrier (she speaks little English)\nand her age and ill-health that make mastering English improbable. Her ties to her spouse and son\nin Taiwan must also be considered when assessing whether there is a heightened risk. DC \u00b6 7(a),\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, and DC \u00b6 7(d) sharing living quarters\nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, are implicated.\nApplicant\u2019s travels to the PRC in the late 1990s (SOR \u00b6 2.d) are not of current security\nconcern since the trips were solely to see his former spouse from whom he has been divorced and\nwith whom he has had no contact since 2002. \nThe heightened risk that exists because of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan may be mitigated\nunder \u00b6 8(a), the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. Applicant was not\ndeterred from moving back to the U.S. without his father in September 2001, even though it meant\nthe physical separation of his parents. Applicant\u2019s and his mother\u2019s contacts with his father and\nbrother in Taiwan are limited to a couple of telephone calls and e-mail messages  yearly and to visits\nfrom them every other year. Bonds are not likely strengthened by such infrequent contact, but\nApplicant is sufficiently close to his family members to be concerned about their welfare and to be\nwilling to sponsor them for immigration to the U.S. There is nothing about Applicant\u2019s 88-year-old\nfather\u2019s activities in Taiwan that heightens a risk of foreign influence. He is retired, in ill health, and\nwas employed as an engineer for a private company before he retired. However, Applicant\u2019s brother\nhas worked for a Taiwanese government-sponsored research institute for about 30 years. Although\nnothing about his particular field of forestry or professional duties (routine survey of timber sites,\nmeasurement of tree growth and assessment of tree health, research into timber planning and\nmanagement) suggests military, security, or intelligence responsibilities, his long government service\nand expertise as a researcher with a doctorate degree heighten the risk.\n\n11\nThe country in which the foreign persons are located is a relevant consideration. Taiwan does\nnot have a hostile relationship with the U.S., and is not known to sponsor terrorism. Taiwan has\nmade considerable progress in achieving democratic elections, civil liberties, and stable, viable\ngovernmental institutions. As reported by the U.S. State Department, Taiwan has taken dramatic\nsteps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic political system since ending\nmarital law in 1987. Almost all restrictions on the press have ended, restrictions on personal\nfreedoms have been relaxed, and the prohibition against organizing new political parties has been\nlifted. While the U.S. does not support independence for Taiwan and is committed to a one China\npolicy, under the Taiwan Relations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to\nhelp Taiwan defend itself, including making available defensive arms and defensive services to\nTaiwan. U.S. commercial ties with Taiwan have been maintained and expanded since 1979, and\nTaiwan is not likely to jeopardize its relationship with the U.S. by overly pressuring its citizens. Yet\neven nations with a history of friendly relations do not always have the same interests. As recently\nas 2004, a female Taiwanese intelligence officer cultivated a covert personal relationship with a U.S.\nState Department official that bears troubling implications, although no proof of, active collection\nefforts by or on behalf of the Taiwanese government.\nHowever, should any foreign influence be brought to bear on Applicant\u2019s relatives, Applicant\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. His decision to remain\nin the U.S. after graduate study was borne of an admiration for U.S. culture from his days as a\nstudent in Taiwan. His voluntary decision to acquire U.S. citizenship took an affirmative act on his\npart, and the delay in acquiring that citizenship (some 15 years after he came to the U.S. on a student\nvisa) was credibly explained by his need for a sponsor and the five-year waiting period after\nacquiring permanent residency. Applicant\u2019s recent destruction of his foreign passport and\nnotification to the TECO that he renounced his Taiwanese citizenship shows his  allegiance is to the\nU.S. where he has owned a home since 1987, pursues his career, and has all of his financial assets.\nHe serves as a mentor to eighth grade students in an educational initiative sponsored by his\nemployer, is an active member of his church, and has volunteered for the Special Olympics\norganization in his area. In contrast to these established ties to the U.S., he has not traveled to\nTaiwan since September 2001, and has no ongoing business contacts in Taiwan. Applicant\u2019s return\nto Taiwan in 1998 was solely because of his mother\u2019s serious illness and limited life expectancy, and\nas soon as she was well enough, he brought her to the U.S. to live and sponsored her for permanent\nresidency. Applicant\u2019s marriage even took a back seat to his desire to live and work in the U.S.\nAlthough Applicant does not have longstanding family ties in the U.S., his strong personal/emotional\naffinity for the U.S. and his financial ties to the U.S. are sufficient to apply MC \u00b6 8(b), there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nWhole Person Analysis\nUnder the whole person evaluation required under the Directive (The adjudicative process\nis an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that\nthe person is eligible for a security clearance (AG \u00b6 2(a)), Applicant\u2019s record of dedicated\ncontributions to his defense contractor employer weighs in his favor. Those who work with him have\nfound him to be an ethical person, and he was candid about his Taiwanese connections when he\n\n12\ncompleted his security clearance application. When notified his possession of a Taiwanese passport\nwas an issue for his clearance, he demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the U.S. in turning his\nTaiwanese passport in to his employer\u2019s security office for destruction, and recently in notifying\nTaiwan of his intent to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. It is also relevant in assessing\nApplicant\u2019s security suitability that he accessed classified information without adverse incident after\nbeing granted an interim clearance, and there is no new information of potential security concern that\nraises questions as to his ability to comply with security requirements.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. His second marriage led to\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems, and ultimately a number of delinquent debts and judgments.\nApplicant has demonstrated he is financially responsible by resolving the debts. Applicant has\nmitigated the financial considerations concern.  He did not knowingly falsify his security clearance\napplication. Thus, he has mitigated the security concerns under personal conduct. Clearance is\ngranted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nApplicant was not available for a hearing prior to this date. He works off shore drilling and no facilities were\n2\navailable for video teleconference either.\nTr. 31.\n3\nTr. 24-28.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On April 27, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR on a unknown date, and elected to have a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2007. I scheduled a hearing for\nOctober 25, 2007.2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on October 25, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A-J) were admitted into the\nrecord without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant. Applicant had one witness testify\non his behalf as reflected in the hearing transcript. The transcript (Tr.) was received on November\n5, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from high school\nin 1987, and attended a Diver\u2019s Academy. Applicant has been with his current employer since 2002.\nHe is twice divorced and has two children.3\nApplicant\u2019s first wife handled the family financial affairs. During this marriage from 1990\nuntil 2001, Applicant had no financial difficulties. His work as an offshore commercial diver caused\nhis absence from home. The period of time varied from several weeks to more than a month for a\nparticular offshore project, and he was on call (24/7). However, his wife handled all the bills and\neverything was in order. His credit was good and he had no delinquent bills.4\nApplicant and his first wife divorced in 2001. As a result of the divorce,  Applicant paid child\nsupport to his wife. When Applicant remarried in 2003, his second wife was to handle the financial\naffairs due to his continuing employment as a diver. Applicant sent his pay home but his second wife\nneglected to pay the bills. Not only did she not pay the routine bills, but she did not send the checks\n\nTr.29-30.\n5\nTr. 33; AE I\n6\nGE 2 ( 2005Credit Bureau Report).\n7\nThe SOR did not list an allegation 1.g. See (AE A-G).\n8\nTr.35.\n9\nTr.53.\n10\nAE J (Personal Financial Statement, dated September 18, 2006).\n11\nTr. 58.\n12\n3\nfor the child support to his first wife. Applicant learned about this situation sometime in 2004 or\n2005,and resolved the issued by having a payroll deduction for the child support.  \n5\nApplicant\u2019s second wife did not make the mortgage payments on their home for\napproximately one year. The company called Applicant\u2019s home and spoke to his wife. Applicant was\ntotally unaware of the situation. When he arrived home in 2006, he learned that the mortgage\ncompany foreclosed on his home and that the home was sold at a sheriff\u2019s auction.  At that point in\n6\ntime, Applicant learned about several judgments and saw his credit report. Since July 2006, he has\nresolved the majority of the delinquent debt.  \nApplicant had $39,400 in delinquent debt.  Applicant has paid the delinquent bills and\n7\njudgments in allegations 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l in 2005, 2006 and 2007.  Applicant did\n8\nnot have notice of the bills until he looked at a credit report after his security clearance application.\nThe alleged debts in the SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b were listed as \u201cmedical account\u201d for a total of\n$395. He does not know the origin of the bills.  Allegation 1.d refers to a credit card that his wife\n9\nopened and used. He has not paid that bill in the amount of $1,075. He affirms his second wife\ndischarged that bill in her recent bankruptcy.  In 2007, Applicant and his wife divorced.\n10\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $7,500. After expenses, he has a net monthly\nremainder of $3,646. He is current on all his bills. He also pays alimony to his second wife.11\nMoreover, his bills are paid through an online bill pay. Thus, even when he is offshore, his accounts\nare automatically paid timely. He does not have to rely on anyone. Applicant can, through\ntechnology, monitor his accounts offshore.12\nIn 2005, when Applicant answered Section 27 and Section 28 concerning any judgments or\ndelinquent debts more than 180 days delinquent, he answered \u201cno.\u201d He did not know that he had any\nat that time. His second wife was handling the financial affairs while he was on offshore drilling\nassignments. He had not received any phone calls or notices in the mail and had reason to believe\nhis wife was handling the bills and home mortgage. Applicant was credible in his explanation at the\nhearing that he had no intent to deceive the government. He honestly had not seen a credit report and\ndid not know about the debts and judgments. I found his answers reasonable and his testimony\ncredible.\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n13\nId. at 527.\n14\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n15\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n16\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n17\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n18\n4\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n13\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n14\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n15\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n16\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n17\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n18\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors\n19\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\n5\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts establishes Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations). His admissions and credit reports confirm the delinquent debts.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20(a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with creditors in resolving his debts shows he is now\nreliable, trustworthy and has good judgment. He has shown sufficient unusual circumstances to\nestablish that his financial problems are \u201cunlikely to recur\u201d under 20(a). Applicant divorced his\nsecond wife in 2007. He now has an automatic bill pay that he can monitor offshore. Moreover,\nApplicant began paying the delinquent bills as soon as he learned of them, beginning in late 2005.\nHe reasonably expected his second wife to be financially responsible, and he acted in a responsible\nmanner. I find that FC MC 20(b) is applicable. FC MC 20(c) is applicable for the reasons stated\nabove. Even though, Applicant did not receive counseling, he has resolved the problem. Finally,\nApplicant paid all the bills and judgments and the home foreclosure is resolved.  He has paid the\n19\nmajority of the debts listed in the SOR. The small debt on his wife\u2019s credit card does not constitute\nan issue as she took responsibility for it in her bankruptcy.\n\n6\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nOn October 27, 2005, Applicant, in response to Section 27 and Section 28 concerning\nfinancial delinquencies and judgments, he answered \u201cno.\u201d When he responded to the questions, he\ndid not know that the accounts were overdue. He had never received any notices of these accounts\nas he was working offshore for long periods. He relied on his second wife to assume the\nresponsibility for the financial affairs. She gave him no indication that she was not taking care of the\naccounts. Applicant never received any notices or phone calls to alert him otherwise.\nUnder DC 16 (a), the government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his\nanswer to Section 28. He denied that he deliberately or knowingly falsified an answer to his security\nclearance application. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden\nof proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an Applicant\u2019s intent\nor state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record\nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence regarding an\nApplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC 16 (a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from an personnel security\nquestionnaire.....) To apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission was deliberate.\nI do not find that this omission was a deliberate falsification. I find in favor of Applicant for personal\nconduct.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant had a history of good credit and no financial problems until his second marriage.\nHe has worked offshore for almost 20 years for varying periods of time. It is not uncommon for\npeople in his line of duty to have a spouse handle the financial affairs in their absence. His first wife\nproved such a partner. Applicant\u2019s second wife assumed that role, but neglected to pay bills despite\nthe fact that Applicant sent her his salary to do so. She also told Applicant that she was taking care\nof financial matters. He believed her to his detriment. Applicant addressed the debts as soon as he\nwas made aware of the situation. Applicant separated from his wife and finally divorced in 2007. His\nbills are now automatically deducted from his account while he is away offshore. He is current on\nall his bills and pays alimony and child support. \n\n7\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his financial issues, and personal conduct. He is eligible for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:-1.l:\n            For Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

There is no allegation of falsification of this SF 86.\nEx. 4 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated April 23, 2007). \n2\nOn August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum\n3\ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Applicant\u2019s case is resolved under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines.\nEx. 5  (Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, received at DOHA on M ay 15, 2007) is the source for\n4\nthe facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph.\nApplicant had four delinquent debts listed on the SOR. He borrowed money to invest in\nthe stock market, and the market declined in 2001 resulting in large financial losses. His wife\nlost her job. He recently paid all four debts, and completed credit counseling. Financial\nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 13, 2005, Applicant signed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nApril 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to him,  pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\n2\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  The\n3\nSOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer received at DOHA on May 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.  On June 1, 2007, the case was\n4\nassigned to me. His hearing was held on June 28, 2007. Applicant requested, and I agreed to\nhold the record open until July 10, 2007 for Applicant to provide evidence of payment and\nfinancial counseling (record of proceedings (R.) 35-36). DOHA received the hearing transcript\non July 10, 2007. On July 10, 2007, Department Counsel indicated she had no objection to my\nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s additional evidence, which I admitted into evidence (Ex. B). I\nclosed the record on July 10, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nAs to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant\u2019s response to the\nSOR admitted responsibility for all four delinquent SOR debts listed in the SOR, and\nstated he would settle his debts.   \n\nEx. 1, supra n. 1, at questions 1 (date o f birth), 5 (education), 6 (employment), 8 (spouse), and\n5\n9 (relatives) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless otherwise stated. \nSOR\n\u00b6 \n SOR       \nAmount\nSettlement\nAmount\nAccount Type and Current\nStatus\n\u00b6 1.a\n$10,075\n$2,003\nCredit Card-Paid \n\u00b6 1.b\n$9,958\n$8,885\nCredit Card-Paid\n\u00b6 1.c\n$3,606\n$2,250\nCredit Card-Paid \n\u00b6 1.d\n$15,944\n$7,785\nCredit Card-Paid\nTotal\n$39,583\n$20,923\nApplicant is 47 years old (R. 7).  He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical\n5\nengineering from a university in 1982 (R. 7). He married his current spouse in 1994.\nHe has one child, who was born in 1999. A government contractor has employed him\nfor 25 years as a systems engineer (R. 8). He has held a secret clearance for more\nthan 20 years (R. 8).     \nApplicant used credit cards to borrow money to invest in internet stocks listed\non the stock market (R. 21-22). He charged $50,000 to $60,000 on credit cards (R.\n22). The market declined in 2000-2001, and in 2002 several companies went\nbankrupt. He lost his investment (R. 23). In 2001, Applicant\u2019s spouse lost her job\nbecause of the post-September 11, 2001, business slowdown (R. 23). She was\nunemployed for about 18 months (R. 24). Applicant\u2019s father had lung cancer and he\nprovided financial support of about $500 per month to his father (R. 24). In 2004, he\nrecovered financially and began negotiations with his creditors (R. 17).  \nThe following table lists the amounts of the SOR debts, and their current\nstatus.\nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($10,075), on May 10, 2007, the creditor agreed to\nsettle the account for $2,003 (Ex. A at 2; R. 27). On May 18, 2007, Applicant paid\nthe creditor, resolving the debt (Ex. B at 4; R. 27). \nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($9,958), on June 8, 2007, the creditor agreed to\nsettle the debt for $8,885 (Ex. A at 5; R. 29). On June 11, 2007, Applicant paid the\ncreditor, resolving the debt (Ex. A at 6; Ex. B at 6; R. 30).\nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,606), on May 9, 2007, the creditor agreed to\nsettle the debt for $2,250 (Ex. A at 3; R. 30). On June 1, 2007, Applicant paid the\ncreditor, resolving the debt (Ex. B at 6; R. 30-31).\n\nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($15,944), on May 9, 2007, the creditor agreed to\nsettle the debt for $7,785 (Ex. A at 4; R. 31). On May 25, 2007, Applicant paid the\ncreditor resolving the debt (Ex. B at 4; R. 31).\nApplicant received credit counseling and on July 9, 2007, prepared a budget\n(Ex. B at 8-9). His gross salary is $82,000 per year (R. 26). His monthly net income\nis $4,220. His monthly expenses include his house payment ($375), groceries ($600),\nutilities ($360), insurance ($372), gasoline and car expenses ($225), clothing ($200),\nand miscellaneous ($70) (Ex. B at 9). His monthly expenses total approximately\n$2,000. Applicant has credit cards, but he pays them off every month (R. 25). He has\n$25,000 in savings (R. 26). He had the ability to pay his debts earlier, but when he\ndealt with his creditors they were unpleasant (R. 32). More recently, his creditors\nwere cooperative and willing to work with him (R. 33).  \n     \nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge\nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access\nto Classified Information\u201d (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach AG, the AGs are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information. These AGs are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead,\nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies\nthese AGs in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2.\nAn administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nshould consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nthe final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n6\nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the\nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence\ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal\nM aritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less\nthan a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\n7\nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of\nthe Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of\nestablishing controverted facts by substantial evidence, demonstrating, in\naccordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the\ngovernment has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition,  the\n6\nburden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\nclearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating\ncondition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2005).7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a\nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures during off-duty hours.\nThe government has a special relationship with those who have a security clearance\nand reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in them. Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning financial problems.\n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).\n8\nSee ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173\n9\nat 4 (App. Bd. M ay 26, 2004)). W hen making a recency analysis, all debts are considered as a whole.\n  \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d \nTwo disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c).  \nApplicant admitted he was responsible for all four of the SOR debts. The\nGovernment produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions,\nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating\ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\nGovernment.8\nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e)\nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or\nis under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant paid the four SOR debts in May and June 2007. The AGs do not\ndefine \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d\nconduct. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,  I conclude AG \u00b6\n9\n20(a) partially apples. Because Applicant had multiple delinquent debts, which were\n\n\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to\n1 0\ncircumstances outside his or her control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted\nin a reasonable m anner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4\nn.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (A pp. Bd. M ay 25, 2000); ISCR Case\nNo. 99-0012 at 4(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay\n1 1\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an\napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The\nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that\nthe concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a p erson acts in a way that shows\nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly,\nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available\noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating\ncondition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting\nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \nunpaid when the SOR was issued, the first two prongs of AG \u00b6 20(a) are against him.\nHowever, he meets the third prong of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he has shown sufficient\nefforts and unusual circumstances for concluding that such financial problems are\n\u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d The unusual circumstances are the poor choices in 2000\n(borrowing money to invest in the stock market), which caused him to make\npurchases he could not afford. His investments declined in value from 2000 to 2002,\nas well as his wife\u2019s unemployment in 2001 and 2002 caused his financial\ncircumstances to deteriorate. However, his financial circumstances steadily\nimproved after 2002, and financial counseling will help him with his budget and\nassist him in avoiding future debts. His recent, aggressive efforts to resolve his\ndelinquent SOR debts remove any doubts concerning his \u201ccurrent reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \nApplicant disclosed some information to support application of AG \u00b6 20(b).10\nThe initial delinquent debts resulted from the stock market decline and his wife\u2019s\nunemployment. The record did not disclose any information indicating his actions\nwere in bad faith. However, Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of\nAG \u00b6 20(b) because he did not act more aggressively to resolve his delinquent debts. \nApplicant receives credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because there is sufficient\nevidence that he has received financial or credit counseling, and his SOR debts are\npaid. His financial problems are resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to\nestablish that Applicant showed \u201cgood faith\u201d in the resolution of his debts.  He\n11\ndoes, however, receive some credit for paying his debts even though the pertinent 4-\nyear state statute of limitations rendered his debts legally uncollectable. See Tex.\nCiv. Prac. & Rem. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.004(c) and 16.051 (statute of limitations for\ncontracts); 16.004(a)(3) (statute of limitations for debts); Cont\u2019l Casualty Co. v. Dr.\nPepper Bottling Co. of Tex., 416 F.Supp. 2d 497, 505-507 (W.D. Tex. 2006); Facility\n\nIns. Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, 357 F.3d 508, 513-514 (5  Cir. 2004)\nth\n(discussing statute of limitations for open or revolving accounts). \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and\njudicial value of application of the statute of limitations:\nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations\nin that they stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by\ngiving security and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy\nconsideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of\nlaw to promote and achieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes\nof limitations provide potential defendants with certainty that after a set\nperiod of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend time-\nbarred claims. Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from\nsitting on their rights. Statutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental\nto our judicial system.\n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552\n(S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nThe elimination of his delinquent debts reduces his potential vulnerability to\nimproper financial inducements. The degree that he is \u201cfinancially overextended,\u201d is\nalso eliminated. However, it does not negate his past conduct in failing to take more\naggressive and timely actions to maintain communications with his creditors and to\nresolve his financial jeopardy in a more timely fashion. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. He did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d with respect to any of his delinquent SOR debts.\nIn sum, he has demonstrated sufficient effort to resolve financial concerns to\nmerit application of mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20(c), as well as partial\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), and (d). These adjudicative AGs are further\naddressed in the whole person analysis portion of this decision, infra. See ISCR 04-\n07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under\nadjudicative AGs for debts being resolved through garnishment). His aggressive\nactions in May and June 2007 to obtain financial counseling, set up a budget and his\npayment of his delinquent debts are particularly noteworthy.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have\nconsidered the general adjudicative AGs related to the whole person concept under AG\n\u00b6 2(a). As noted above, Applicant\u2019s failure to make greater progress resolving his\ndelinquent debts is a serious, ongoing, long-term problem and is sufficiently serious to\nraise a security concern. His actions were knowledgeable and voluntary. All of his\ndelinquent debts were paid at the time the record was closed. He is 47 years old,\nsufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. The motivation for his\nfailure to pay his debts was insufficient income, and reluctance to work with some of\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n1 2\nhis creditors. Delinquent debts are inconsistent with prudent and responsible behavior.\nA person \u201cwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds\u201d and as such the potential for pressure and exploitation is raised.    \nApplicant presented substantial extenuating and mitigating evidence. His\nfinancial problems were aggravated by lack of income, unemployment, the stock\nmarket slump, and his father\u2019s lung cancer. He paid his delinquent SOR debts in May\nand June 2007, even they were collection-barred by the pertinent state\u2019s 4-year statute\nof limitations. The elimination of his delinquent debts has reduced his potential\nvulnerability to improper financial inducements. Prior to payment of his creditors,\nnone of his SOR creditors filed a judgment or took other judicial action against him,\nwhich is an indication of the lack of financial pressure upon him. He received\nfinancial counseling. He has held a clearance for many years without a security\nviolation. The absence of evidence of any prior violation of his employer\u2019s rules or\nrequirements, his forthright and candid statement at his hearing, and his evident\nsincerity about making future financial progress all weigh in his favor. He pays his\ncredit cards off every month, and he has $20,000 in his savings account. In sum, the\nlikelihood of recurrence is low because sufficient evidence was presented about\nimprovement in his overall financial situation, the absence of evidence of other\ndelinquent debts, and financial counseling.  \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to financial considerations. The evidence leaves me\nwithout doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12\nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the AGs.\nApplicant has successfully mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nApplicant has a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, which includes six alcohol-\nrelated incidents when he was arrested and charged with drunk driving. His most recent offense\noccurred in August 2005. He has reduced his consumption of alcohol, but he continues to drink\nabout once a week. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concerns. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for a security\nclearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of\n1\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on April 27, 2007.\nThe SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for the\naction and alleges security concerns under Guideline G for alcohol consumption and Guideline J for\ncriminal conduct.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending formal amendment.\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nOn May 15, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned for hearing on July 9, 2007. The hearing took place as scheduled on August 14, 2007. At\nhearing, the SOR was amended, without objections, in two ways:\n\u2022\nSubparagraph 1.m was added to Guideline G as follows\u2014In August 2005, you were arrested\nfor DUI in [county], [state]. You entered a plea of guilty.\n\u2022\nSubparagraph 2.a under Guideline J was amended to include a reference to subparagraph\n1.m.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript on August 22, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n3\nApplicant admitted all allegations under Guideline G. He did not respond to the sole\nallegation under Guideline J, which refers to the criminal conduct (drunk driving) alleged under\nGuideline G. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 46-year-old production technician with an associate\u2019s degree awarded by a\ntechnical institute. He has worked for his current employer since September 2005. His work involves\nassembling and testing equipment for military weapons. He has never married and he has no\nchildren. He loves his job, describes himself as a hard-working employee who is treated with respect\nby the company, and he desires to continue his employment with the benefit of a security clearance.\nIn August 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with his sixth drunk-driving offense.\nHis history of drinking-and-driving includes arrests and charges for driving under the influence\n(DUI) in 1988, 1992, 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2005. For the 2004 incident, he was convicted of\nreckless driving; otherwise, he was convicted of DUI. The most recent incident in August 2005 was\nresolved by a plea agreement wherein Applicant pleaded guilty to the DUI offense. The outcome was\nApplicant driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months, and he was ordered to receive alcohol\ntreatment, serve community service, and serve probation.\nHe has a valid driver\u2019s license issued by his state of residence (R. 48\u201350). It was issued in\nFebruary 2004, and it has an expiration date of December 2009. Also, it reflects that an ignition-\ninterlock device was imposed on him until February 27, 2007. This condition, now expired, stemmed\nfrom his August 2005 DUI offense.  \nHis history of drinking alcohol includes alcohol counseling and treatment in 1993, 1995, and\n2005. During the 1993 counseling or treatment, he was assessed as suffering from mild alcohol\ndependence, but the qualifications of the person who made that assessment are unclear. He has\ncontinued to consume alcohol since his 1998 arrest to present. He reduced his level of consumption\nafter his arrest in August 2005. He now limits his beer drinking to one day per week when he is at\nhome working around the house and yard. He intends to continue drinking alcohol at his current\nlevel. He does not participate in Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar group or organization. He has\ndeveloped a relationship with God that he practices by talking to God like he would speak with a\nfriend. This has helped him to reduce his level of drinking. Other than his testimony, Applicant did\nnot present any other evidence. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n5\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n6\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n4\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBecause the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct allegations in the SOR are factually\ninterrelated, they are discussed together. The government contends that Applicant\u2019s history of\n\n Revised Guidelines at 15\u201316 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n15\nGuideline G DC 1 (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\n16\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual\nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d) ; Guideline G DC 3 (\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol\nto the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d); and Guideline J DC 1 (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d). \n5\nalcohol consumption and alcohol-related incidents raises security concerns under Guidelines G and\nJ. Applicant concedes his past mistakes, but contends that he is not a bad person and that he would\nnever reveal classified information. The question is whether Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol\nconsumption and drunk-driving offenses, the most recent of which was August 2005, is consistent\nwith eligibility for access to classified information under the clearly-consistent standard.  \nThe general concern under Guideline G is that excessive alcohol consumption often leads\nto the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses. It can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a\n14\nsecurity concern because criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. It calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.  \n15\nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, security concerns are raised under Guidelines\nG and J. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and\nalcohol-related incidents. His drinking-and-driving resulted in six arrests and five convictions for\nDUI. His most recent DUI offense occurred in 2005. The evidence reveals a firmly ingrained pattern\nof drinking-and-driving despite adverse legal consequences as well as alcohol counseling and\ntreatment. His history of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol-related incidents raises security\nconcerns under the applicable DCs of the guidelines.  \n16\nAll of the MCs under both guidelines have been given due consideration and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. He has a well-established history of alcohol-related incidents and alcohol\ncounseling or treatment, and he continues to drink alcohol at least once a week. Given these\ncircumstances, it is too soon to tell if Applicant will establish a pattern of responsible alcohol use\nthat does not result in yet another alcohol-related incident. \nIn addition, this case has been considered in light of the whole-person concept and that\nanalysis does not support a favorable decision. Based on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant\ndid not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the alcohol consumption and\ncriminal conduct security concerns. Likewise, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to\nobtain a favorable clearance decision.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline G:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraphs a\u2013m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 24, 2006, Applicant submitted an application to renew the security\nclearance required for his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the\nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding2\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. On July\n13, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n Applicant objected to Gx. 4 because the documents therein are nearly illegible. I overruled his objection\n4\nbecause I am able to read enough of the documents to determine they are summaries of Applicant\u2019s federal\ntax accounts for tax years 1987 through 1993. The information in Gx. 4 gives a detailed accounting of the\nbasis for the tax liens documented in Gx. 2. However, the detail in Gx. 4 was not essential to my findings of\nfact here.\n The allegation did not specify when the lien was filed.\n5\n2\nwhich raise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)3\nunder Guideline E (personal conduct).\nOn October 3, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 2, 2007, and I scheduled a hearing to be\nheld on December 14, 2007. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government\npresented ten exhibits (Gx. 1 - 10).  Applicant testified in his own behalf and submitted\n4\none exhibit (Ax. A). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 4, 2008. I left the\nrecord open to allow Applicant time for a post-hearing submission. On January 7, 2008,\nI received information from Applicant which has been included in the record as Ax. B.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is granted.\nProcedural Issues\nAs originally issued, the SOR alleged under Guideline E that Applicant\ndeliberately made false statements to the government through a Questionnaire for\nNational Security Positions (QNSP) dated February 24, 2006. Specifically, it was\nalleged he lied when he answered \u201cno\u201d to QNSP question 23, which is purported to\nhave elicited information about his arrest record, thus omitting the fact he was charged\nin March 2003 with assault and battery. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The government further alleged\nApplicant lied when he answered \u201cno\u201d to QNSP question 27, which is purported to have\nelicited information regarding whether Applicant had any tax liens against him in the\npreceding seven years, thus omitting the fact he had a federal tax lien against him.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b)  Finally, the government alleged Applicant lied when he answered \u201cno\u201d to\n5\nQNSP question 28, which is purported to have elicited information about whether\nApplicant owed any debts greater than 180 days past due in the last seven years, or\nwhether he was then more than 90 days past due on any debt, thus omitting again the\nfact he had a federal tax lien against him. (SOR \u00b6 1.c)\nOn October 30, 2007, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding\nan additional allegation under Guideline E as follows:\n1.d You falsified material facts on a Questionnaire for National Security\nPositions, you caused to be transmitted on or about February 24, 2006, in\n\n3\nresponse to \u201cSection 28. Your Financial Delinquencies. a. In the last 7\nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?; b. Are\nyou current over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d You deliberately\nfailed to disclose that you were indebted to the Internal revenue Service\nfor back taxes, interest and penalties for tax years 1998, 1999, and 2002,\ntotaling approximately $2,050 in July 2006.\nThe motion also proposed adding a second paragraph containing\nallegations under Guideline F as follows:\n2. Guideline F: Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. Available information raising this concern shows that:\na. You failed to file your Federal Income Tax Returns for tax years\n1989, 1990, and 1991, and filed late your Federal Income Tax Returns for\ntax years 1987, 1988, 1992, and 1993. \nb. On July 19, 1994, the Internal Revenue Service filed a federal\ntax lien against you for the approximate amount of $33,069.54 for tax\nyears 1987 through 1992. As of July 3, 2007, this debt had not been paid.\nc. You filed late your Federal Income Tax Returns for tax years\n1998, 1999, and 2000.\nd. You are indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in the\napproximate amount of $849.14 for tax years 1998 through 2000. As of\nJuly 9, 2007, this debt had not been paid.\nApplicant did not respond to the motion before the hearing. At hearing, he did\nnot object to the motion, which I granted as submitted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied the original allegations under Guideline E (Tr., 16 - 17) He also\ndenied the new allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d, but admitted the new allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n2.a through 2.d. (Tr., 17 - 24). After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and\nexhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 58 years old and has worked as a painter for defense contractor at\na U.S. Navy shipyard since 1972. After he finished high school, he served in the U.S.\nNavy from 1970 until 1972. Applicant has been married to his current wife since 2002.\nA previous marriage ended in divorce around 1986. (Gx. 1, Gx. 5)\n\n In response to DOHA interrogatories on April 20, 2007, Applicant attached a handwritten letter purported to\n6\nbe from a representative of the IRS. At hearing, Department Counsel stated he had contacted the author and\nverified the authenticity of the letter as a communication from an IRS representative. (Tr., 41).\n4\nApplicant did not file federal income tax returns as required in 1989, 1990, and\n1991. He also filed his returns late for tax years 1987, 1988, 1992, 1993, 1998, 1999,\nand 2000.\nOn July 19, 1994, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a lien against\nApplicant for unpaid taxes in tax years 1987 through 1992. The tax debt totaled\n$33,069.54. (Gx. 2) At one time, Applicant also owed $2,050.20 for tax years 1998,\n1999, and 2000, but he entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS (Gx. 6). His\ndebt to the IRS from those tax years is now $1,155.16 for tax year 1999 only. (Gx. 7)\nThe second page of Gx. 2 notes that, unless the IRS were to renew, within 10 years, its\nclaims underlying the lien, the lien would be released. The 1994 lien expired in March\n2007 (Gx. 7), but there is no information about whether the lien was renewed. The IRS\nhas stated that, aside from the $1,155.16 owed for tax year 1999, he is \u201cin compliance\nwith all filing requirements through 2005.\u201d (Gx. 7)  Applicant has also received small\n6\nrefunds from his past tax year filings. (Ax. B)\nApplicant has held a security clearance for most of his adult life, starting with his\nservice in the Navy. During a previous investigation to renew his clearance, Applicant\nwas interviewed by a government investigator in May 1994. Applicant reported at that\ntime he had not filed his tax returns since 1986. At the time of the interview, he had\ncontacted the IRS and was waiting to complete an arrangement to file his returns and\npay an estimated $7,000 in federal and state taxes. (Gx. 5) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent background investigation began when a Questionnaire\nfor Sensitive Positions (SF 86) was submitted on or about February 24, 2006. Gx. 1 is\na copy of the electronic summary of that questionnaire. Applicant\u2019s signature is on an\nattached signature page taken from a Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP). The summary of the SF 86 does not reflect the actual questions Applicant\nanswered when he submitted his application. Rather, the document contains\nabbreviated terms indicating what the question addressed. For example, where a\nquestion asked for information about whether there were any arrests in the last seven\nyears for offenses not listed elsewhere, the form lists only \u201c23F - LAST 7 YRS,\nADDITIONAL CHARGES?\u201d There is no language explaining the need to list arrests\neven if the charges were dismissed, or listing the availability of a limited statutory\nexception to the reporting requirement. In sum, Gx. 1 contains none of the language\ncited in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d.\nIn March 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery on\na spouse after neighbors called the police about an argument he was having with his\nwife. The charge was dismissed after his wife testified in his behalf. (Tr., 56 - 57) The\narrest was not reflected in Gx. 1. Applicant explained he thought he did not have to list\nthe arrest because the charges were dismissed. (Tr., 65 - 66) Nor was the unpaid tax\nlien listed in Gx.1; however, under a section of the questionnaire entitled \u201cSUBJECT\u2019S\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n7\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are:(1) The nature, extent, and\n8\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n9\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n11\n5\nCOMMENTS,\u201d it was noted that Applicant is \u201cPAYING ON TAXES YEAR 2000 - $175\nPER MONTH.\u201d \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n7\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or\n8\nmitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant.\nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial\nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and\nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15 and\nGuideline F (financial considerations), at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n9\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n10\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The\ngovernment, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses\nthe requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the\nnational interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.11\n\n Directive, E3.1.14.\n12\n6\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in AG \u00b6\n15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d\nApplicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d that he intentionally\nfalsified his security questionnaire. The government was thus required to present\ninformation to prove those controverted issues of fact.  These SOR allegations cite\n12\nspecific questions and quote the language of each one. The document presented in\nGx. 1 does not contain any of that language. Nor does Gx. 1 appear to be a QNSP as\nalleged, and the signature pages included in Gx 1 are from two other forms, neither of\nwhich is a QNSP. In short, there is no proof that Applicant answered the questions\nquoted in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d. Without that information, I cannot conclude he certified his\nanswers to those questions were true and correct to the best of his knowledge.\nIn the alternative, the remarks section of Gx. 1 notes monthly payments for back\ntaxes, thus providing the government with notice of Applicant\u2019s tax problems. Further, I\nfound plausible Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did not think he was required to list his\nassault and battery arrest because the charges were dismissed.\nBased on the foregoing, the information presented in support of SOR \u00b6 1, as\namended, does not prove Applicant acted with the intent required by AG \u00b616(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities). Accordingly, I resolve Guideline E in favor of the Applicant.  \nFinancial Considerations. \nUnder Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18) The government alleged Applicant failed to file taxes either\non time or at all for several years between 1987 and 2000. As a result, Applicant was\nsubject to a tax lien filed in July 1994 for unpaid taxes totaling $33,069.54 for tax years\n1987 through 1992. It was also alleged that Applicant owes $849.14 for tax years 1998\nthrough 2000. The government presented sufficient information to support the SOR \u00b6 2\nallegations. These facts require consideration of the disqualifying condition listed in AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), 19(c) (a history of not meeting\n\n See footnote 8, supra.\n13\n See footnote 7, supra. \n14\n7\nfinancial obligations), and 19(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax\nreturns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same). \nThe record also warrants consideration of the mitigating condition listed in AG \u00b6\n20 (c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Available\ninformation shows that, as of the hearing, Applicant owed $1,155.16 for tax year 1999\nonly, the tax lien was released, he had resolved all of his past filing requirements, was\nmaking payments on his remaining tax debt, and had even received some refunds for\npast tax years. On balance, the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s\ninformation are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines F and E. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is 58 years old and has spent the past 32 years in the same job. He\n13\nhas held a security clearance for all or most of that time, apparently without incident.\nApplicant is a high school graduate who, while he did not attend to his filing\nrequirements as he should, has now corrected his past tax problems. That the lien was\nnot renewed is somewhat of a double-edged sword. Ideally, he would take action to\nrepay it, but that would revive the IRS claim. However, because the IRS has chosen\nnot to further pursue its claim, it is no longer something which might cause Applicant to\nengage in illegal acts to resolve. \nOn balance, Applicant did not engage in fraudulent behavior to avoid paying his\ntaxes, and he is likely to timely file his tax returns in the future. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all available information shows that the Applicant\u2019s\n14\nfinances and personal conduct do not present an unacceptable risk should he be\ngranted access to classified information. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

McCormack, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on November 28,\n2005. On October 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nG, J, and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 31, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on November 2, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on November 16, 2007. The case\nwas assigned to another judge and a hearing was scheduled on December 12, 2007.\nThe hearing was cancelled due to appearance of counsel. I received the case\nassignment on December 7, 2007. I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until\nFebruary 26, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated November 28, 2005).\n1\nGE 3 (Applicant\u2019s response to Interrogatories, dated March 16, 2006).\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nJanuary 29, 2008, in order for his counsel to be available. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on January 2, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 29,\n2008. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 10, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through D,\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 11,\n2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a- 1.g; \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c; and \u00b6\u00b6 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, 3.e, and 3.f of the SOR, with\nexplanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 3.d of the SOR. He also provided\nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is divorced with two adult children. After his high\nschool graduation in 1987, he began employment with a government contractor. He has\nmaintained that employment for 20 years, receiving various promotions. He holds a\nconfidential clearance.1\nApplicant started drinking alcohol in high school with his friends. He drank beer\non the weekends. In 1986, he was charged with improper equipment and Driving Under\nthe Influence (DUI). He attended driver improvement class. The charge was later\namended to Reckless Driving. His license was suspended. In 1987, Applicant was\ncharged with Drunk in Public. He and his girlfriend were in his car and she had an open\nbottle of alcohol. He was arrested and fined $15 and ordered to pay $20 in court costs.\nHe was on probation for one year. In 1988, Applicant was fined for being disorderly in a\npublic place.2\nIn May 1989, Applicant was found guilty of a DUI. He completed an alcohol driver\nawareness program ordered by the state. His license was suspended for six months. He\nreceived counseling in a chemical dependency program after that incident from June\n26, 1989 until January 1990.  \n3\nApplicant\u2019s 1989 marriage ended in divorce in 1998. Applicant was awarded\ncustody of his two sons after contested custody. He raised his two sons as a single\nparent. In March 1999, Applicant was with his son at a basketball game. He and his ex-\nwife had a disagreement over how to handle a minor injury that his son received.\nApplicant was arguing with his ex-wife and stepped in front of her and she fell back. He\nwas charged with a misdemeanor assault and battery of a family member. As a result of\n\nTr. 38; 39 and 40.\n4\nTr. 35; GE 4 (Interrogatories, dated March 2006).\n5\nTr. 42; 43 and 44.\n6\nGE 2 (Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories, dated March 2006).\n7\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated March 2005).\n8\nAE C (Performance Appraisals 2005-2007).\n9\nAE B (Enclosures 1-7).\n10\n3\nthis charge, Applicant was required to attend anger management classes. He\ncompleted the course successfully. The court also placed Applicant under a restraining\n(protective) order for 12 months. Applicant complied with the court orders and on July 5,\n2000, the charges were dismissed.4\nIn February 2000, Applicant received his second DUI charge. He was found\nguilty and sentenced to 60 days jail (suspended), placed on probation, fined, had his\nlicense suspended and was  referred to alcohol rehabilitation. He completed counseling\nand received treatment for a substantial period of time until November 2002. Applicant\nattended Alcoholics Anonymous and abstained from drinking for a short time.5\nOn October 27, 2000, Applicant purchased a shot gun for his son as a Christmas\npresent. He completed the requisite paperwork. He was charged with making a false\nstatement to purchase a firearm/false statement on firearm consent form, which is a\nfelony under state law because he did not disclose that he was under a protective order\nat the time of the application for the firearm. He believed the year for the protective\norder was over and thus he did not disclose anything on the form. On March 8, 2001,\nthe charges were Nolle Prosequi (dismissed) and Applicant paid a $50 fine.6\nApplicant has continued to consume alcohol. He drinks beer after work. His\nnormal work day is approximately 12 hours. His recent alcohol consumption was\napproximately 12 beers a week. He does not drink at work.7\nOn Applicant\u2019s November 28, 2005, security clearance application he disclosed\nhis incidents and arrests involving alcohol, domestic violence and purchase of a shotgun\nfor his son. He answered \u201cyes\u201d to questions concerning his police record. He listed the\ncharge for making a materially false statement and the subsequent dismissal of the\ncharge in 2001. He did not disclose any use of marijuana or any other illegal drug.8\nApplicant\u2019s work performance is rated \u201cexceeds normal requirements\u201d or higher.9\nHe has recommendations from his colleagues and his supervisor. Applicant is very\nprofessional in his conduct and work ethic. He is an asset to his current team. He gets\nalong well with others and has a strong commitment to his job. Applicant is a\nconscientious and meticulous worker. He requires minimal supervision. 10\n\nTr. 44.\n11\nGE 5 (Report of Evaluation, dated July 17, 2007).\n12\nId.\n13\nAE A (Affidavit, dated January 23, 2008).\n14\n4\nApplicant responded to written interrogatories in March 2006. He disclosed that\nhe had used marijuana (1996) in response to Question 1 concerning the use of any\nnarcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) and/or any\nCannabis (to include marijuana and hashish).  \n11\nIn November 2006, Applicant was working 12 hour days for long periods at a\ntime. He forgot to register his vehicle. He was charged with failure to obtain\nregistration/title, an infraction under the state code. He was fined and ordered to pay\ncosts.\nOn July 2, 2007, Applicant was evaluated for substance abuse as part of his\nsecurity investigation. He admitted to a history of significant alcohol use. He also\nacknowledged using marijuana and trying cocaine in the past but does not do so any\nlonger. After receiving treatment for alcohol and substance abuse from 1999 until 2002,\nhe continued to drink. His last reported alcohol use was June 30, 2007. However, a\nurine screen collected at the time of the evaluation revealed a positive for\nethyglucuronide. The urine screen reports any consumption of alcohol for approximately\n80 hours prior to the test. Due to the test result, the evaluator opined \u201cthe test results\nappear to be in direct contradiction with his self reported last use. This allows for some\nconcern that his consumption may be more significant than he revealed.\u201d The evaluator\nin 2007 recommended an outpatient substance abuse treatment program for at least 16\nweeks. Applicant did not heed the recommendation for the treatment or abstinence. She\nalso recommended a 12-step support group and urine screening and breath alcohol\ntesting. Applicant did not comply with the recommendations.12\nDuring the 2007 evaluation for drug use, Applicant was asked many questions.\nHe admitted trying cocaine in the past when he was a teenager. He forgot to list cocaine\nas a drug that he had used in the past on his March 2006 interrogatories.13\nOn January 23, 2008, shortly before his hearing, Applicant signed an Affidavit\nthat he no longer drinks alcohol. He is willing to submit to another evaluation and\nparticipate in treatment.   He realizes that it was not the wisest decision not to begin\n14\nanother treatment program at that time. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nIn this case, Applicant has a documented history of problems with alcohol when\nhe was young man (1986-1989). He has several alcohol related driving incidents and\narrests. His last DUI was in 2000. He admitted he has a history of significant alcohol use\nwhich has led to impaired judgment while driving. Thus, AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) apply.\nIn July 2007, Applicant was evaluated for substance abuse by a licensed\nsubstance abuse therapist/practitioner. The legal and substance abuse treatment\nhistory was deemed significant. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or\nalcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a\nrecognized alcohol treatment program,\u201d applies.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\n\n7\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant had a lengthy history of alcohol abuse, and his last DUI was in 2000.\nSince that time, he has not had any other alcohol-related incidents. He has received\ncounseling and treatment on several occasions. Applicant did not see a need to abstain\nfrom alcohol after his treatments. In 2006, he acknowledged drinking beer and he\nintended to do so in the future. However, he did not heed a 2007 recommendation to\nabstain from drinking or enter an outpatient treatment program. He acknowledges that\nwas not a wise decision. The therapist doubted that Applicant truthfully reported his last\nuse of alcohol. Just a few days before the hearing, Applicant vowed to abstain from\nalcohol and began counseling sessions. He received alcohol treatment and counseling\nin the past and did abstain from drinking for short periods of time. Thus, his drinking is\nlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s recent consumption of alcohol and untruth to the therapist as\nshown by the urine test showing recent alcohol use does not allow mitigation under\n23(a) and (b).\n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u201c\u00a9 allegation\nor admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests and DUI\u2019s combined with his arrest for\ndomestic assault, his charge of making a false statement to purchase a firearm\nconstitute criminal activity as envisioned under \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c).\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\n\n8\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement;\nApplicant has had no serious infractions with the law since 2000. He has been\nemployed with the same company for 20 years. He raised his son as a single parent.\nHis completed anger management classes after the domestic incident with his ex-wife.\nHe has modified his alcohol consumption as described above. He is described as an\nexemplary employee. Thus, 32(a) and (d) apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative.\nApplicant disclosed the information concerning the 2001 charge concerning the\ngun he purchased on his 2005 security clearance.  He did not disclose any illegal drug\nuse in the past. However, when he completed his 2006 interrogatories he listed\nmarijuana use in 1996. I find him credible that he did not think of that since it was in the\ndistant past. The government did not establish that this was an intentional omission on\nthe part of the Applicant. Similarly, in 2007 when Applicant was interviewed and\nevaluated for substance abuse, he acknowledged use of marijuana and trying cocaine.\nHe did not list cocaine in the 2006 interrogatories. He used cocaine one time when he\nwas a teenager. He did not think about it when he was answering the questions about\nillegal drug use in 2006. If he were trying to hide something, he would not have been so\nopen with the evaluator in 2007. Thus, \u00b616(a) has not been established. \n\n9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant had problems with alcohol when he was young. His last incident with\nalcohol occurred in 2000. Since that time he completed court ordered treatment\nprograms and modified his drinking. Applicant did not exhibit any problems with alcohol\nafter his 2002 treatment. However, he was diagnosed recently in 2007 by a licensed\ntherapist and did not heed the recommendations for treatment. He also was not truthful\nabout the last use of alcohol according to the test result noted in that report. Applicant\nalso was involved in a domestic assault incident with his ex-wife in 1999. He completed\nhis probation and successfully completed anger management classes. In 2000, he\ndecided to purchase a gun for his son. However, he did not realize that he was still\nunder a protective order. Thus, he did not disclose anything unfavorable on his\napplication for the gun purchase. The charge for the misrepresentation was dismissed. \nApplicant raised his sons as a single parent. He has been employed with the\nsame company for 20 years. He has received various promotions during the years. His\nappraisals rate him as exceeding standards. He has never had any difficulty at work\nwith any situation, including alcohol. He disclosed information on his 2005 security\nclearance application in detail concerning his alcohol-related incidents, arrests, and\ndomestic assault charge. He also listed the charge concerning the purchase of the gun\nand the charge for misrepresentation. However, he did not list any use of an illegal drug\non that application.\nIn 2006, when Applicant completed an interrogatory for drug use, he listed\nmarijuana in 1996 but did not list the cocaine. During the 2007 evaluation he was asked\nmany questions. He acknowledged that he used marijuana and had tried cocaine once.\nApplicant was candid at the hearing that he did not think to mention the 1996 usage of\nmarijuana or his experiment with cocaine. He had already disclosed his various\ninfractions and problems with the law and his police record in the 2005 application. This\nwas not an intentional deception on Applicant\u2019s part.\n\n10\nApplicant is a loyal and hardworking employee. He is a dedicated father. He has\nmany favorable references and character notes. He extricated himself from his marital\nsituation. However, he has not mitigated the security concerns under the alcohol\nconsumption guideline. Just several days before the hearing, Applicant vowed his\nalcohol consumption was behind him. Granted, he has not been involved in any legal\nissues or problems at work as a result of drinking. However, given the long history of\nalcohol use, diagnosis by a therapist, minimizing of alcohol consumption, and his\ndecision in 2007 not to followup on treatment and abstain from drinking, it is premature\nto conclude that it will not recur. He has just recently decided not to drink and began\nalcohol treatment. He realizes that he is now subject to scrutiny for testing and would\njeopardize his job and his security clearance.  However, a longer track record of\nabstinence is necessary to mitigate alcohol consumption concerns. He was candid at\nthe hearing and was credible in his testimony that he is not vulnerable to any threats or\nintimidation that might jeopardize national security.        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct. He has not mitigated the concern under alcohol consumption. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Item 11 indicates she\n1\nmay be five years younger.\n \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and recommended referral to\nan Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 21, 2007, and elected to have her case\ndetermined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's\nwritten case (FORM) on or about October 16, 2007. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on or\nabout November 26, 2007. The case was assigned to me on December 5, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 54 year old  employee of a defense contractor.\n1\nSOR Allegation 1a: Applicant had 12 unpaid medical debts, totaling approximately\n$2,866.00, placed for collection between December 2001 and April 2007.\nSOR Allegation 1b: Applicant is indebted to CAP 1 Bank in the approximate amount of\n$1,906.00 on an account that was charged off in 2002.\nSOR Allegation 1c: Applicant is indebted to JeffersNCP in the approximate amount of\n$3,876.00 on an account placed for collection in January 2004.\nSOR Allegation 1d: Applicant is indebted to Midland Credit in the approximate amount of\n$4,892.00 on an account placed for collection in February 2004.\nSOR Allegation 1e: Applicant admits she was indebted to Credit Protection in the\napproximate amount of $72.00 on an account placed for collection by Hollywood Video in February\n2004. She stated in her SOR response that she paid off the debt. In her response to the FORM, she\nattached a credit report, and next to the entry for this debt, she wrote \u201cPaid-Dispute.\u201d The credit\nreport itself indicates that the debt is still outstanding.\nSOR Allegation 1f: Applicant was indebted to Capital One in the approximate amount of\n$1,219.00 as a result of a judgment entered against her on May 17, 2004. The credit report she\nsubmitted in response to the FORM indicates the judgment was satisfied in March 2005.\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to Question 27 regarding judgments was correct. Therefore, SOR\n2\nAllegation 2a is found for applicant. \n \n \n3\nSOR Allegation 1g: Applicant denies she is indebted to Calvary Spvi LLC as a result of a\njudgment entered against her. Given applicant\u2019s denial, and the similarities between this judgment\ndebt and the Capital One judgment debt (e.g., date of judgment), there is a strong likelihood these\nare the same debt. Accordingly, this allegation is found for applicant.\nSOR Allegation 1h: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$325.00 on an account placed for collection by Cross Check in February 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1i: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$532.00 on an account placed for collection by United Illumina in May 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1j: Applicant is indebted to Citi in the approximate amount of $2,622.00.\nThis debt was charged off in 2005.\nSOR Allegation 1k: Applicant is indebted to this creditor in the approximate amount of\n$1,100.00 on an account placed for collection by Southern Connec in December 2006.\nSOR Allegation 1l: Applicant has an automobile loan with AmeriCredit. She fell behind on\nher payments in early 2007. Although she stated in her SOR response that she is \u201cpayed up to date,\u201d\nthe credit report she submitted in response to the FORM appears to indicate the account is still\ndelinquent.\nSOR Allegation 1m: A personal financial statement applicant prepared in March 2007\nindicates her monthly expenses exceed her monthly income.\nApplicant has had contact with a consumer credit counseling agency. However, in response\nto the FORM, she indicated the agency told her they could not help her at this time.\nSOR Allegations 2a, 2b, and 2c: On an SCA she executed on September 14, 2005, applicant\nintentionally provided false, material information when, (1) in response to Question 28a, she denied\nshe had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts during the previous seven years, and (2)\nin response to Question 28b, she denied she was then over 90 days delinquent on any debt.2\nSOR Allegation 3a: In 1980, applicant was convicted of Larceny.\nSOR Allegation 3b: In 1984, applicant was convicted of Assault.\nSOR Allegations 3c and 3d: In 1985, applicant was convicted of Larceny, and in a separate\nincident, was convicted of Issuing a Bad Check.\nSOR Allegations 3e and 3f: In 1992, and again in 1995, applicant was convicted of issuing\nbad checks.\n\n4\nCONCLUSIONS\nWith respect to Guideline F, applicant has a long history of not meeting her financial\nobligations. This conduct reflects adversely on her judgment and reliability, and suggests she cannot\nbe relied upon to safeguard classified information. Disqualifying Conditions 19a (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and 19c (a history of not meeting financial obligations) are applicable.\nOnce the Government established a prima facie case under Guideline F, the burden shifted\nto applicant to produce evidence in mitigation, extenuation or reformation sufficient to overcome the\ndoubts about her security-worthiness raised by her financial irresponsibility. Applicant failed to meet\nher burden. Even if she were given the benefit of the doubt with respect to the debts alleged in SOR\nParagraphs 1e, 1h, 1i and 1l, the fact remains she still has about 17 delinquent debts, totaling\napproximately $17,000.00, to deal with, and with her monthly expenses exceeding her monthly\nincome, there is little to no chance she will be in the position to deal with them anytime soon. No\nMitigating Conditions are applicable, and Guideline F is found against applicant.\nWith respect to Guideline E, applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications of material facts on the SCA\nare extremely troubling. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals\nseeking access to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts\non an SCA, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he or she nevertheless possesses the good\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders. Applicant\u2019s intentional\nfalsifications require application of Disqualifying Condition16a (the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire  . . .).\nBecause applicant\u2019s history of dishonesty dates back to the 1980s, this cannot be considered an\nisolated incident that is unlikely to recur. Based on the foregoing, and the fact applicant offered no\npositive evidence concerning her character, honesty, and integrity from people who know her well\n(e.g., family, friends, coworkers, supervisors), Guideline E is found against her. No Mitigating\nConditions apply. \nWith respect to Guideline J, applicant has numerous criminal convictions. Disqualifying\nCondition 31a (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) is applicable. Although applicant\u2019s\ncriminal convictions are all over then years old, and would have been mitigated if no subsequent\ncriminal conduct occurred, the evidence clearly establishes that applicant violated 18 U.S.C. 1001,\nand thereby committed a felony, when she intentionally provided false information on her SCA. This\nfact precludes application of any of the mitigating conditions under Guideline J.\nIn reaching my decision in this case, I considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors set forth in\nSection E2.2 of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nPARAGRAPH 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 2: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\nPARAGRAPH 3: AGAINST THE APPLICANT\n\n5\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.\n____________________________\nJoseph Testan\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Edmunds, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Bruce Heurlin, Esquire; Eric J. McNeilus, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn July 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under\nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge\nto determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 7, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on August 22, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on\nOctober 31, 2007.  A hearing was held on October 31, 2007, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on five witnesses (including himself)\nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n2\nand 29 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on November 9, 2007.  Based upon\na review of the case file,. pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nPrior to the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add (1)\nsubparagraph 1.f that states as follows: \u201cOn or about June 12, 2007, you were arrested\nand charged with breach of the peace.  You pled guilty and received time served and a\nfine of $330.00.  You were intoxicated at the time of this incident and arrest\u201d and (2)\nsubparagraph 2.g that states as follows: \u201cThat information as set forth in subparagraph\n1.f above.\u201d  There being no objection from Applicant, and good cause being\ndemonstrated, Department Counsel\u2019s motion was granted.  Applicant admitted the\namended allegations of the SOR. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to (1) have been involved in a number of\nalcohol related arrests between August 1990 and June 2004 and arrests and (2) have\nhad an administrative action taken against him at a commercial airport in July 1996 for\nallegedly bringing 6 grams of hash into the U.S. (Fined $500.00). \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant is alleged (a) by incorporation to have been\ninvolved in the alcohol-related arrests covered under Guideline J, (b) to have continued\nto consume alcohol to the point of intoxication through at least February 2007, despite\ncounseling for alcohol abuse, and \u00a9) to have been terminated by a previous employer in\nOctober 2003 for missing work due to drinking the night before. \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (I) had administration action\ntaken against him at a commercial airport in July 1996 (see Guideline J), (ii) used\ncocaine on at least 20 occasions during the period of July 1998 through December\n1999, (iii) used marijuana during the period of October 1983 through July 1998, (iv)\nused crystal methamphetamine at least 10 times during the period of July 1992 through\nJuly 1997, (v) used hash approximately 10 times during the period of June 1996 through\nJuly 1996, (vi) used LSD during the early 1990s, and (vii) sold marijuana and LSD\nduring the early 1990s.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor who seeks\nto retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant was introduced to alcohol and marijuana while in high school and\nabused both for many years.  He served two years in the Army between 1986 and 1988\n\n3\nand was honorably discharged.  He estimates to have used marijuana on a regular\nbasis, at times daily, between 1990 and July 1998 before quitting altogether.  He used\nother illegal drugs in addition to his marijuana use.  Between July 1998 and December\n1999, he used cocaine on at least 20 occasions.  Other illegal drugs he tried include\ncrustal methamphetamine (at least 10 times between July 1992 and July 1997), hash\n(approximately 10 times during the period of June 1996 and July 1996), and LSD during\nthe 1990s.  During the early 90s, Applicant sold  marijuana and LSD (R.T., at 174-75).\nHe assures he has not used illegal drugs of any kind since December 1999 (R.T., at 64-\n65, 144) and has not associated with any of his old high school friends and associates\nwho used illegal drugs (R.T., at 145-46).\nApplicant was involved in a number of alcohol-related incidents between August\n1990 and June 2004 and had administrative action taken against him in July 1996 at a\ncommercial airport for bringing six grams of hash into the airport from overseas\n(resulting in a fine of $500.00). Applicant\u2019s $500.00 fine was assessed at the airport\n(R.T., at 175-76). \n Records show that Applicant was arrested in August 1990 for driving under the\ninfluence (DuI) after failing a sobriety test and registering .153 per cent on an\nadministered Breathalyzer test (R.T., at 180).  He was later found guilty of DuI, jailed\none night, fined $1,000.00, and required to attend alcohol-related counseling.  Applicant\nhad been out drinking (estimated 10 to 12 beers) with his girlfriend at the time (who\nwould subsequently become his spouse), and had become engaged in a verbal fight\nwith her.  While driving home, he was stopped by police and arrested  (R.T., at 179-80).\nApplicant married W in 1996 following seven years of courtship and had two\nchildren (both daughters) from this marriage.  One of his daughters died at birth in\nDecember 1999 following an emergency c-section delivery (R.T., at 141-43).  His\nyoungest daughter was born in 2001 and attends kindergarten (R.T., at 147-48).  Before\ntheir marriage, W used drugs and alcohol extensively. \nApplicant continued to consume alcohol regularly following his July 1996 arrest.\nIn June 1997, he was arrested and charged with public intoxication.  He was found\nguilty as charged and fined. Besides the fine, he was ordered to pay restitution for the\ndamage he caused to the room he was staying in (R.T. at 184).  Applicant later\nreimbursed the hotel manager to cover the hotel\u2019s assessed damages (around\n$1,000.00). \n In August 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with alcohol intoxication in\npublic.  Applicant had been drinking before the incident.  He was fined by the court\nhearing his case (R.T., at 185).  \nFollowing his August 1999 arrest, Applicant continued drinking.  In counseling\nsessions with MN in 2002, he described his drinking pattern between 1999 and 2002 as\nmostly episodic, which entailed drinking every three to four months moderate.  He\nrecounted one extended 13 month period between September 2001 and October 2002\n\n4\nafter his daughter was born when he maintained his abstinence with the help of\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) (see ex. C; R.T., at 61, 197-98). \nApplicant was involved in an abusive marriage and went through a difficult\nseparation in 2003 that culminated in divorce in December 2004 (R.T., at 71-72).\nBecause of marital stress in his life, he ceased his AA participation, frequented bars,\nand consumed alcohol quite regularly to self-medicate his stressors (R.T., at 202-03).\nHis ex-wife told him after a year of continuous sobriety \u201cthat she liked him better when\nhe was drinking.\u201d (see ex. 33; R.T., at 51).  Stressed by his marriage, he consumed\nalcohol to excess the night before an important company meeting in October 2003..\nSpecifically, Applicant and a co-worker met a woman in a local bar and continued their\ndrinking in the woman\u2019s hotel room after dinner (R.T., at 187-88). A hotel worker,\nconcerned about his leaving the establishment on his own, helped him to a vacant room\nto spend the night.  Applicant overslept and missed an important business meeting the\nfollowing morning with a government customer.  When the customer could not find\nApplicant in his hotel at the appointed time, he departed and informed his own\ngovernment managers, who, in turn, notified Applicant\u2019s employer (R.T. , at 188-89).\nUpon further investigation of the incident, his employer of eight years at the time\nterminated his services. \nApplicant continued to drink heavily throughout the first six months of 2004,\nnormally every two weeks or so, and most of the time to intoxication (R.T., at 203-04).\nHis beverages of choice were beer and rum.\n In June 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication.  He\nhad consumed alcohol in a local bar with a friend and accidentally bumped another car\nwhile stopping at a local fast food establishment (R.T., at 152).  Informed of the incident,\nmanagement of the establishment called the police.  Administered a Breathalyzer test\nby the arresting officer at the scene, Applicant registered a .169 per cent BAC (R.T., at\n190).  In court, he was found guilty of DuI-Liquor/Drugs/Toxic Vapors, sentenced to 72\nhours in jail, fined a total of $2,420.20, and placed on probation.  Additionally, the court\nsuspended his driver\u2019s license, and required him to complete alcohol substance\nscreening and the MADD impact panel (see ex. B; R.T. ,at 190-91).\nApplicant enjoyed several months of sobriety following his June 2004 DuI\nincident and attended weekly therapy meetings with his licensed therapist (M), in\naddition to returning  to AA (see exs. C and 31).  Applicant estimates he attended  more\nthan 200 AA meetings over the course of seven months before suspending his\nattendance between 2005 and 2007 (see exs. 31 and 33; R.T., at 154-55, 186).  At the\ntime, his therapist described Applicant as an episodic alcohol abuser, who could enjoy\nextended periods of sobriety before returning to alcohol.  Her April 2007 records report\nthat his father served in the military and was often away from the family (see ex. 28).  M\nreported that Applicant\u2019s father had no history of drugs, alcohol, or abusive behavior\nand died in 2002 (ex. 28).\n\n5\nAfter suspending his AA meetings in 2005, Applicant  resumed his drinking,\nconvinced he could continue his drinking under control on his own (R.T., at 207-08).  He\ncontinued drinking throughout 2005 and 2006.  He apparently did not advise his\ncounselor (M) of his resumption of drinking.  When asked at the hearing, she could not\nrecollect his telling her of his drinking resumption in 2005 (R.T., at 74).\nIn June 2007, Applicant relapsed on a business trip and became intoxicated in a\nlocal drinking establishment.  He was subsequently arrested for public intoxication.  He\npled guilty to the charge, received time served, and was fined.  Applicant could provide\nno real explanation for his relapse.\nConcerned about his most recent relapse and arrest, Applicant first reported his\narrest to his immediate supervisor (K).  K put Applicant in touch with his employment\nassistance program (EAP), who promptly referred Applicant to Dr. D (see ex. 29; R.T.,\nat 161-62, 170).  Dr. D diagnosed Applicant in July 2007 with alcohol abuse and\nadjustment disorder on the Axis I of the DSM-IV\u2019s multi-axial assessment system.  Dr. D\nidentified Applicant\u2019s Axis IV stressors as isolation, lack of positive support, an unhappy\nmarriage and a lack of community support.  Dr. D reported that Applicant did not receive\nvery much support from his employer\u2019s employment assistance program either.\nWith the instrumental influence of his sponsor, Applicant returned to AA in July\n2007, along with five employees from his company (R.T., at 166-67).  His sponsor relies\nheavily on the \u201cBig Book\u2019s\u201d 12-steps, and has steered Applicant to using the 12 steps.\nWith the help of his sponsor and AA, Applicant has been able to maintain his sobriety\nsince June 2007 (a period of almost four months).  He received a three-month chip from\nAA commemorating his abstinence efforts (R.T., at 159).  He credibly assures he has\nmaintained his sobriety since June 2007 and has no desire to return to drinking (R.T., at\n168-70).  To ensure his EAP counselors of his regular AA attendance, he completes\nweekly attendance forms and faxes them to his EAP office (R.T., at 170). \nApplicant has continued to receive outpatient counseling from M and is credited\nwith making good progress (see ex. 30).  She has treated Applicant periodically since\n2004 and credits Applicant with maintaining a pattern of light to moderate drinking\nbetween 2004 and 2007.  Based on her most recent observations of Applicant and his\nAA progress (supported by an excellent sponsor), she would adjust his diagnosis to\nepisodic alcohol abuse in remission and scratch his secondary adjustment disorder (see\nexs. 28 and 32; R.T., at 81-82). \nM has no basis to diagnose Applicant with binge drinking (no such diagnosis\nexists according to M) and attributes this terminology to Dr. D\u2019s basic diagnosis of\nalcohol abuse (R.T., at 82).  M credits Applicant with having a strong spiritual program,\nexcellent educational achievements, and clear goals for his future (R.T., at 52-53).\nAlbeit, she continues to characterize Applicant as an episodic alcohol abuser (ex. 32;\nR.T., at 61). \n\n6\n  Applicant\u2019s sponsor has been a consistent AA participant for over 18 years and\nhas been Applicant\u2019 sponsor since July 2007 (see ex. 34; R.T., at 88-89).  He credits\nApplicant with being very sincere about working hard, changing his life, and living sober.\nHe and Applicant have regularly attended AA meetings together since July 2007, and\nhe says Applicant has made great progress in completing the 12 steps assigned to him\n(ex. 34; R.T., at 90-91).  Applicant is presently working on step 10 and is credited by his\nsponsor with being better than most candidates (R.T., at 91).  The sponsor was aware\nof Applicant\u2019s slip in June 2007, and makes no distinctions between slips and lapses.  \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor (K) describes Applicant as a responsible line\nmanager who has been very forthcoming about his past problems with alcohol (see ex.\n13).  K credits Applicant with facing his alcohol problems and keeping her informed of\nhis 2007 relapse and the progress he is making with his alcohol programs (ex. 13; R.T.,\nat 149-50).  Another supervisor familiar with Applicant\u2019s work describes him as\norganized, thorough in his work, and reliable (see ex. 14).\nA co-worker (R) of Applicant who has worked with him for the past three years\ndescribes him as a responsible team member who has been rapidly promoted (R.T., at\n108-10).  R\u2019s spouse is the natural father of Applicant\u2019s current girlfriend (since early\n2007), and R socializes with both Applicant and her stepdaughter (R.T., at 116-17). \nOther co-workers familiar with Applicant\u2019s alcohol problem credit him with being\nhighly trustworthy and responsible in his work (see exs. 15 through 17).  One (see ex.\n16) expressed familiarity with Applicant\u2019s attending AA 12-step meetings and reaching\nout in his community to help others.   This co-worker describes Applicant as a kind,\nloving, and caring person in his work and personal relationships with his friends and\ndaughter (ex. 16).                                                                                                               \n                  \nApplicant has a girlfriend (B), who is employed by the same employer as\nApplicant.  She credits Applicant with accepting his responsibilities very seriously (R.T.,\nat 127).  She acknowledges attending a party with Applicant during their first months of\ndating where  Applicant became intoxicated, and she remembers Applicant\u2019s consuming\ntoo much alcohol at home on another occasion (R.T., at 137-38).  But she says\nApplicant was up-front with her about his June 7 alcohol-related incident and has shown\nconsiderable change in his lifestyle since his June 2007 incident (R.T., at 131-33). BT\nassures that Applicant has kept his supervisor, manager and friends aware of his past\nproblem with alcohol and his current sobriety efforts (R.T., at 136). \nB and Applicant spend much of their spare time together with Applicant\u2019s\ndaughter (R.T., at 147-48).  Applicant has visiting rights that permit him to see his\ndaughter on Wednesdays of each week and on special occasions (R.T., at 148-49).\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\n\n7\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if\nany, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern. \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires\nAdministrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated\nin the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security\nclearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As\nwith all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a\nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge\ncannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\n\n8\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis\nApplicant is a highly regarded network engineer for a defense contractor with a\nhistory of abusive alcohol consumption and illegal drug use, off and on, over a 25-year\nperiod. His alcohol history includes six alcohol-related incidents between 1990 and\n2007.  Applicant\u2019s past drug use involvement, his history of alcohol and drug-related\nincidents (seven in all between 1990 and 2007), and his recently diagnosed alcohol\nabuse reflect raise security concerns covered by Guidelines J, G, and H of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol/criminal conduct issues\nApplicant\u2019s five arrests and work-termination covered in the SOR cover alcohol-\nrelated offenses and raise major concerns over his risk of recurrent alcohol abuse.\nThose alcohol-related incidents that resulted in arrests/convictions outside of the\nimmediate work place entail overlapping criminal conduct and invite overlapping\nconcerns covered by the criminal conduct guidelines as well. \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions (DC)\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d 22\u00a9),\n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless\nof whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d and\n22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical\npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.\u201d \nBecause six of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses are covered by arrests or\ncharges that involve criminal conduct, they are covered by the guidelines for criminal\nconduct as well.  Specifically, DC 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d applies.  Although his abusive drinking the night before his scheduled\nbusiness meeting created adverse consequences with his employer, his drinking did not\n\n9\ninvolve any covered criminal offense.  Consequently, this episode of alcohol abuse is\nnot specifically covered by the guideline for criminal conduct.\nTo his credit, Applicant has acknowledged his drinking problem and sought\ncounseling and treatment for his recognized problem.  He renewed his AA commitments\nfollowing his July 2007 diagnosis from Dr. D, obtained a new sponsor, and maintained\nhis sobriety for approximately four months before his hearing. \nStill troubling and of ongoing security concern is Applicant\u2019s history of recurrent\nrelapses following periods of treatment and AA participation, and his lack of any\nextended period of sustained abstinence.  While M provides assurances of his sincere\ncommitment this time to maintain his current track of sobriety with the help of AA and\nher outpatient counseling support, his sustained abstinence efforts are still relatively\nnew (only four months since his diagnosis and five months since his last alcohol-related\noffense).  This is not to suggest his renewed commitments to sobriety do not reflect\npositive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.  His efforts have drawn\nconsiderable praise from his treatment counselor (M).  Favorable views of his progress\nfrom work colleagues who know him are also helpful in gauging the strength of his\ncommitment to sobriety. \nWith his long history of alcohol-related incidents, and drinking abuses, relapses\nfollowing treatment and counseling, and still relatively short time in sustained abstinence\nfollowing his return to AA in July 2007, he is not in a position to apply any of the\nmitigating conditions covered by Guideline G.  Each of the listed mitigating conditions\nare conjunctive and  require all of the cited considerations to be satisfied.  Applicant is\nstill not able to do that at this stage of his recovery.\nTaking into account both Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse, his strong work\nrecord, the applicable guidelines and a whole person assessment of his most recent\nsobriety efforts (which have been roundly praised by his treatment counselors),\nconclusions warrant that his overall efforts, while encouraging, do not reflect sufficient\nevidence of sustained commitment to AA and its tenets of sobriety to convince he is no\nlonger at risk of recurrence.  In the past he has enjoyed considerable periods of sobriety\nonly to return to episodic drinking that involved alcohol-related incidents away from\nwork. \nThat Applicant is free of the stressful marriage that contributed so much to his\nepisodic drinking abuses between 2001 and 2005 provides important reinforcement to\nhis current sobriety efforts.  He has certainly impressed his treatment counselors (both\nD and M) with his most recent sobriety efforts.  His relapse history, however, remains a\nsource of concern.  Without more time in sustained sobriety than the four months he is\ncredited with, it would not be prudent under this record to relax the time mitigation\nrequirements of any of the mitigating conditions of the alcohol and criminal conduct\nguidelines.  In Applicant\u2019s case, these mitigating conditions work conjunctively with each\nother. \n\n10\nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant fails to make a convincing showing\nthat he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent\nproblems with judgment lapses related to alcohol.  Without a more seasoned record of\nsobriety to rely on, Applicant\u2019s mitigation efforts are simply not enough at this time to\nwarrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk of judgment impairment associated\nwith such conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by the alcohol and criminal conduct guidelines of the SOR. \nDrug issues\nBesides alcohol, Applicant abused drugs over a considerable period of time.  He\nused marijuana regularly between 1990 and 1998 and tried cocaine (between 1998 and\n1999) and other illegal drugs (to include crystal meth-amphetamines, hash and LSD) in\nthe 90s.  \nApplicant's recurrent use of meth-amphetamine is sufficient to invoke two of the\ndisqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs, i.e., DC 25(a) \u201cany drug\nabuse\u201d and 25(c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nRecords do not indicate Applicant has used any illegal drugs since 1999.\nApplicant corroborates the absence of any record evidence of illegal drug use\nsince 1999 with his own assurances that he has been drug-free since 1999.  To be\nsure, misconduct predictions (to include return to illegal drug use), generally, may not\nbe based on supposition or suspicion.  See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (Appeal Bd.\nOctober 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356 (App. Bd. April1998).  The Appeal Board has\nconsistently held that an unfavorable credibility determination concerning an applicant is\nnot a substitute for record evidence that the applicant used illegal drugs since his last\nrecorded use, or based on his past use he is likely to resume drug usage in the future.\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (Appeal Bd. May 2004).  Based on Applicant\u2019s\nconsiderable period of demonstrated avoidance of illegal drugs (almost eight years\nnow), he is in good condition to mitigate security concerns over the possibility of his\nresuming his use of illegal substances in the foreseeable future.  \nApplicant\u2019s avoidance of illegal drugs of every conceivable kind for almost eight\nyears is sufficient under all the circumstances considered and whole assessment of\nApplicant to mitigate security concerns associated with his recurrent use and\npossession of illegal substances.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by sub-paragraphs 3.a through 3.g of Guideline H.\n In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, and the factors listed above, I make the\nfollowing formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.e\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.f:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE H (DRUGS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.a:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.b:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.e:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of  all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior project manager, who has worked for a federal contractor\nfor the past 30 years. Applicant began accumulating debt in 1991. He resolved some of it through\nbankruptcies he filed in 1994 and 2000. He recently paid the debts listed in the Statement of\nReasons, demonstrating a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. He mitigated the security concerns\nraised by financial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on January 10, 2005, in conjunction with his\nemployement with a defense contractor. On May 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006, as to why\nDOHA could not make a prelilminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended\nreferral to an administrative judged to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked. \nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on or about June 29, 2007, and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was initially assigned to another administrative\njudge on August 22, 2007, and reassigned to me on October 5, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing on October 10, 2007, setting the case for hearing on October 25, 2007. At the hearing,\nDepartment Counsel introduced Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 into evidence without\nobjections. Applicant testified in his case, called one witness, and introduced Applicant Exhibits\n(AX) A through F into evidence without objections. The record was left open until November 5,\n2007, to give Applicant additional time to submit documents. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on November 2, 2007. On that same day, Department Counsel received additional documents\nfrom Applicant, which I marked as AX G . She had no objection to the documents and they were\nadmitted into the record.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nfinancial considerations under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g). Those admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior project manager for a federal contractor. In 1971, he\nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force. He left military service in 1977, as a staff sergeant (E-5), and began\nworking with his current employer. He has held a security clearance for approximately 40 years and\nworks with classified information. He has two associate degrees  and a bachelor\u2019s degree in business.\nIn January 2005, he completed a security clearance application (SF-86), in order to renew his Secret\nclearance.\nIn December 1991, Applicant divorced his wife and obtained custody of his four children,\ntwo of whom live on their own. His twin sons, ages 24, reside with him. Both of them have special\nneeds and have required additional care growing up. One of the sons started working about a year\nago; the other son began a position within the last four months. His former wife provided limited\nmonetary or emotional support for the children over the years. (Tr. 10; 26).\n\n3\nParagraph 1 of the SOR alleges security concerns under the financial guidelines. Applicant\nadmitted that he filed bankruptcy twice. In February 1994, he petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy,\nhaving accumulated approximately $22,000 in liabilities. After completing the repayment plan, the\ndebts were discharged in August 1996. (GX 5). Those debts arose subsequent to his divorce and after\nassuming custody of his children and additional expenses. (Tr. 27-28).\nIn July 2000, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In September 2000, the court\ndischarged approximately $244,500 in debts, including $144,000 of an unpaid mortgage on his\nresidence. At the time, he began having problems with one of his twins, requiring him to move his\nresidence. As he was unable to manage his bills, while paying off his former wife, he relinquished\nall equity in his home and the bank ultimately foreclosed on it. (Tr. 29-31). He attributed part of the\ndebt to indiscriminate spending during that time period. (Tr. 60). He subsequently reaffirmed several\ndebts and repaid them. (Response 23-27).\nFrom November 2005 until April 2006, Applicant paid $15,000 of his son\u2019s court imposed\nrestitution, after learning that his son was not making the payments. He did so, in order to prevent\nhis son from going to prison. (Response at 29). That expenditure placed an additional strain on\nApplicant\u2019s finances. (Tr. 36-38) That son, along with his other son, recently began contributing\nsmall amounts of money to the family\u2019s monthly budget. (Tr. 48-49).\nThe SOR listed five delinquent debts, all of which are paid. Applicant paid the $874 credit\ncard debt, noted in \u00b6 1.c, in June 2007. (Response at 9-10). He paid the $452 debt, noted in \u00b6 1.d, in\nJune 2007. (Response at 11-13). At the end of June, 2007, he paid the charge card debt of $1,979\nlisted in \u00b6 1.e. (Response at 14-17). He completed his payment plan to the creditor listed in \u00b6 1.f for\n$2,897 in September 2007. In June 2007, he paid the $147 credit card debt, listed in \u00b6 1.g. (Response\nat 20-21). According to Applicant, some of his financial problems began in approximately 1991 with\nhis first bankruptcy and continued until recently. (GX 6, 7 & 8).\nApplicant presented evidence that he also resolved debts not listed in the SOR. He paid off\na credit card debt of $492 in October 2007. He recently completed his payments to the IRS on a\n$1,740 tax liability for 2005 taxes, which he miscalculated on his tax return. (AX D; Tr. 56). In\nJanuary 2006, he completed payments to his father on a $15,000 car loan he had since May 2002,\nand recently repaid him $2,200 for another short term loan. (AX A & D).\nAfter meeting with a credit counselor in January 2007, Applicant prepared a Personal\nFinancial Statement in February 2007. According to that Statement, he earns $8,577 a month, with\na net monthly income of $5,999. His monthly expenses are a $3,136, leaving him about $2,860 for\nother items. Since that time, he paid several debts, including those listed in the SOR. He has six\nremaining financial obligations, totaling $1,000 a month, which includes five credit cards and an\nautomobile loan. (GX 2 at 73, 102-103). He anticipates paying off the credit cards by January 2008,\nleaving a $600 monthly car loan outstanding. He uses his credit cards more carefully than he did in\nthe past and does not intend to maintain high balances. (Tr. 44). \nSeveral times during the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he mismanaged his finances\nover the years and used his charge cards excessively. He candidly admitted that he should have\nexercised more responsible financial judgment. He recognizes that at this time in his life he needs\nto concentrate on saving money for retirement. (Tr. 67). He is committed to establishing financial\nstability. (Tr. 47; 67).\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to\n1\nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App.\nBd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and\nthe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620\n(1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington\nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n4\nOn June 11, 2007, Applicant\u2019s employer selected him to participate in its Reward\nManagement Achievement Plan for 2007 that may provide him with a $4,000 to $5,000 bonus in\nMarch 2008, if he reaches specified goals. Applicant anticipates that he will meet those performance\ngoals, and intends to deposit the bonus income into his savings account. (AX G).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor of seven years testified. He enlisted in the U. S. Navy in 1959 and\nafter four years attended the Naval academy for a couple years. He has held a Top Secret security\nclearance for more than 25 years and works with classified information. He has great confidence in\nApplicant\u2019s abilities and finds him to be very competent and reliable. He indicated that Applicant\nis responsible for overseeing a $20 million dollar budget, used to support the U.S. military forces.\nHe does not consider Applicant to be a security risk. (Tr. 73-76).\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nGuidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative\njudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n1\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce\n\nThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and\n2\u201c\nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the\nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n5\nevidence and prove mitigation. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted\nby applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating\ncondition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22,\n2005). 2\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel\nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or\nimplied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Section 7 of Executive\nOrder 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial security clearance decision shall be\n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all facts in evidence and application of the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors and legal standards, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the\nSOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government concern regarding financial problems. \u201cThe failure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\n\n6\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d\nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports, the Government established\ndisqualifications under two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions: \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has\nbeen unable to manage his debts from approximately 1991 until approximately March 2006, as\nevidenced by two bankruptcies, delinquent debts, and numerous other financial obligations.\nGuideline \u00b6 19(a) and \u00b6 19(c).\nThe Government raised a security concern and the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations. Six Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions can mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under Guideline \u00b6 20(a)-(e). After reviewing all of them,\nI conclude he presented evidence to support application of three of them, but not the others.\n\u00b6 20(a) \u2018\u2018the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d does not apply\nbecause Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing from 1991 until 2006, and does\ncast doubt on his financial judgment up to 2006.\n\u00b6 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d offers limited mitigation in view of Applicant\u2019s divorce\nand assumption of custody for four children, two with special needs, at the time of\nhis first bankruptcy. However, there is no evidence that he contacted his creditors or\nsought credit counseling during the time he began accruing debts, which is the type\nof evidence necessary to establish the second prong of this condition. \n\u00b6 20(c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\napplies because Applicant obtained some credit counseling prior to the issuance of\nthe SOR, completed the Personal Financial Statement, and subsequently paid off\nmany delinquent debts, indicating his financial issues are under control. \n\u00b6 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d is applicable because Applicant provided evidence to\ndocument the payment of the five delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.\n\u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis\nof the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d does not apply in view of\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgment of the debts. \n\u00b6 20(f) \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source of income\u201d is not applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d- Analysis\n\n7\nI considered the totality of the evidence in view of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, including\nApplicant\u2019s middle age, his military service and his marital and family history. I also considered his\n30 year work history with the same employer, the fact that he has held a security clearance for more\nthan forty years without evidence of any problems, and his supervisor\u2019s strong support and\ncommendations. I carefully observed his demeanor while testifying, and listened to his candid\ndisclosure about his history of financial problems and assumption of responsibility for them, along\nwith a committment to funding his retirement. I took into account that he met with a credit counselor\nand reviewed his budget before the SOR issued, and that his two sons are now contributing to the\nfamily budget. Assuming he continues working with that budget and retires all unnecessary debts\nwithin the next couple months, I am confident that he has enough income to cover his obligations\nand will not incur similar financial obligations in the future. Given his acute awareness of the impact\nthat his financial situation has on his employment, I believe he will continue to manage his financial\nobligations and demonstrate good judgment. Based on those facts, I am confident that he does not\npose a security risk.\nAfter weigh the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and all facts and circumstances in\nthe context of the whole person, I concluded Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by\nfinancial considerations. The evidence leaves me with no doubts as to his security elibibility and\nsuitability. Accordingly, Guideline F is found for him.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.S1.g: \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 31, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 6, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Elizabeth M.\nMatchinski denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\n(1) Applicant contends that he was denied due process because he \u201cchose poorly to proceed\nwith a hearing,\u201d rather than to have his case decided on the written record.  In support of this\ncontention, he argues that Department Counsel acted improperly because she subjected him to an\naggressive cross-examination which elicited adverse details about his alcohol use that went beyond\nthe specific facts recited in the SOR and the documentary exhibits, and undermined his credibility\nwith the Judge.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties\nin good faith.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001).  A party seeking to\nrebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that\nheavy burden.  Applicant fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a\nbasis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, unfairly or\nunprofessionally.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005)(No denial of due\nprocess where pro se Applicant claimed \u201cshe was no match for the \u2018very serious and prepared\nprofessionals\u2019 who represented the government\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-21262 at 2-3 (Jul. 10,\n2007)(No denial of due process where pro se Applicant claimed that \u201cDepartment Counsel raised\nhis voice . . . and attempted to sway the Judge with emotional arguments\u201d).  Aggressive cross-\nexamination is an ordinary and reasonably foreseeable part of the hearing process.\nDOHA proceedings are civil in nature, and applicants are not entitled to the procedural\nprotections afforded to criminal defendants.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nOct. 7, 2004).  Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are of no moment.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2006).  A review of the record indicates that\nApplicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the\nDirective.  Although pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to\ntake timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-\n0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take such steps, that failure to act does not\nconstitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2001).\nApplicant\u2019s decision to elect a hearing, rather than a decision on the written record, does not\nconstitute a denial of due process under the Directive or Executive Order.\n\nAs part of his brief, Applicant offers new evidence in the form of additional explanations.  The Board may not\n1\nconsider that new evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\n3\n(2) Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, which he contends shows that his\ncurrent use of alcohol is not of security concern.   This argument does not establish the Judge erred.\n1\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has\nto weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant had a lengthy and serious\nhistory of problematic alcohol use.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant was still drinking contrary\nto most of the therapeutic advice he had received, including from his primary care physician.\nDecision at 8.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length\nand seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nmitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant as to one of the SOR allegations.\nHowever, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in\nmitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not\nreview a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nThe Board has examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole and concludes\nthat the Judge has drawn \u201ca rational connection between the facts found\u201d under Guideline G and her\nadverse decision.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,\n463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

DOHA further alleged that he consumed alcohol for most of his adult life, at times to excess (SOR \u00b6 1.e); that he continues to drink (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he received alcohol treatment at a general hospital in 1988, 1991, and 1992 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), as an inpatient at a treatment center for diagnosed alcohol dependence in May and June 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and court-ordered alcohol education at a hospital in July 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.I).

On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline G. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 11, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge\non October 3, 2007. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 20,\n2007. The case was assigned to me on November 28, 2007. On December 10,  2007, I\nscheduled a hearing for January 24, 2008.\nMarch 6, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing on January 24, 2008, as scheduled. Before presenting\nhis case, Applicant indicated he had inadvertently requested a hearing, that when he\ninformed DOHA he wanted a decision based on the written record, he was told it was\ntoo late (Tr. 26-42). With Department Counsel\u2019s agreement, I gave Applicant the\nopportunity to suspend the proceedings with a referral of the case to DOHA for\npreparation of a File of Relevant Material under \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive. Applicant\nelected to continue with the hearing. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and one\nApplicant exhibit (Ex. A) were received into evidence without objection and Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on February 5,\n2008.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, the record was held open until February 7, 2008, for\nApplicant to submit character reference statements and written closing argument.\nApplicant timely submitted a character reference from his supervisor and his written\nclosing. Department Counsel indicated on February 8, 2008, that the government had\nno objections. The character reference letter was admitted into evidence as Exhibit B\nand the closing argument accepted for consideration. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant was\narrested and convicted of a 1978 public drinking charge (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and of April 1988\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) and September 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) driving under the influence of alcohol\n(DUI) offenses, and was arrested for disorderly conduct in 1987 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). DOHA\nfurther alleged that he consumed alcohol for most of his adult life, at times to excess\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e); that he continues to drink (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he received alcohol treatment\nat a general hospital in 1988, 1991, and 1992 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), as an inpatient at a\ntreatment center for diagnosed alcohol dependence in May and June 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.h)\nand court-ordered alcohol education at a hospital in July 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.I). When he\nanswered the SOR, Applicant admitted without explanation the alcohol-related charges\nand treatment. He denied he had consumed alcohol for most of his adult life, at times to\nexcess, and that he continues to drink. After consideration of the evidence of record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old custodian who has worked for a defense contractor\nsince April 2005. He seeks a security clearance for access to certain areas of the\nfacility. He held a confidential-level security clearance in the late 1980s for his work with\nanother defense contracting firm (Tr. 58, Ex. 1).\nApplicant consumed vodka to intoxication between the ages of 11 and 12, about\nonce a month when he could sneak some from his parents\u2019 supply. He then refrained\nfrom drinking for a couple of years until age 15 or 16. Thereafter he consumed alcohol\nto obtain \u201ca buzz.\u201d On three or four occasions, he was arrested for alcohol-related\n\n3\noffenses while still a juvenile (Tr. 67). In 1978, he paid a $50 fine for public drinking on\nthe beach (Tr. 68).\nIn June 1985, Applicant and his spouse married. She had three young daughters\nfrom a previous relationship that she and Applicant raised together (Tr. 57).\nIn 1987 he was arrested for disorderly conduct but the charge was dismissed,\nand Applicant denies he was drunk (Tr. 68). After his mother died in 1987, he turned to\nalcohol to cope. Employed at the time by a defense contractor, Applicant was\nreprimanded for reporting to work while intoxicated (Tr. 64). He participated in three\nweeks of alcohol treatment (group sessions and 12-step programs) to save his job and\ndid not think he had an alcohol problem (Tr. 69-71).\nIn April 1988, he was arrested for DUI. He was found guilty and his license was\nsuspended (68-69). He attended alcohol education sessions at a local hospital once or\ntwice a week for about four months in 1988 (Tr.72-73), but it had little effect on his\ndrinking. In 1989, his brother died unexpectedly from an overdose (Tr. 62-63).\nApplicant continued to consume alcohol (beer and whiskey) to excess, and to have\nproblems at work due to drinking (\u201cAt [defense contractor X], they used to have parties\nand the bosses would bring in booze and everybody got drunk.\u201d Tr. 63). After reporting\nfor duty drunk on about a half-dozen times, he was eventually fired from his defense\ncontractor employment that he had held for some 10 or 11 years (Tr. 56, 63-64, 95).\nRealizing he needed help to deal with his drinking problem (Tr. 50),  Applicant\nadmitted himself to a treatment center in May 1990. He was treated as an inpatient until\nsometime in June 1990. Applicant found the treatment beneficial as it taught him how to\ndeal with his feelings and to not blame others for his drinking (Tr. 51-52, 100). Applicant\nwas told by his counselors that he had an alcohol problem. He is not sure whether he\nwas diagnosed as alcohol dependent (Tr. 75).\nIn September 1990, Applicant was arrested for his second DUI. He was\nconvicted and sentenced to three months in the house of corrections (suspended),\nfined, and required to attend an alcohol education program. Applicant participated in the\ncourt-ordered alcohol education program in July 1991. He also returned to the local\nhospital for  alcohol counseling in 1991 (Tr. 77-79). Applicant was advised by several of\nhis counselors that he should abstain from drinking. He took from his various treatment\nprograms that drinking was a personal choice and to take responsibility for his\ndecisions, including whether to drink (Tr. 101).\nBy 1992, Applicant had stopped drinking but he was still having problems dealing\nwith his brother\u2019s untimely death. On the verge of relapsing, Applicant had himself\nadmitted to a local hospital for about a week (\u201cI don\u2019t believe I got into a program. I think\nthey gave me a bed for about a week . . . \u201c Tr. 77-78).\nFollowing eight or so months of abstinence from alcohol (Tr. 81), Applicant began\ndrinking beer socially while shooting pool, attending weddings, and on holidays (Tr. 84).\n\nW hen asked whether he had lied to his doctor about his drinking, Applicant responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think it ever\n1\ncame up in detail, I think he asked me simply if I have a problem with alcohol and I told him no.\u201d (Tr. 91).\nApplicant also denies he went to an office visit with alcohol in his system. W hile his physician suggested to\nhim that he abstain, Applicant testified he volunteered to undergo random testing to confirm for his physician\nthat he wasn\u2019t drinking before his visits (Tr. 91-93).\n4\nSince Applicant resumed drinking in 1992/93, he has consumed alcohol to the point of\nbeing \u201ca little buzzed.\u201d (Tr. 84). He also has consumed alcohol while alone (\u201cMaybe, I\ndon\u2019t know, once in a while you have a tough night or a night cap to go to sleep, yeah,\nI\u2019ve done that.\u201d Tr. 85).\nIn October 1994, he and his spouse moved to another state and in April 1995, he\nstarted working as a crew leader (Ex.1). In 2002, they returned to their present locale\nand Applicant worked as a maintenance mechanic for a commercial tool company until\nhe started with his present employer in April 2005 (Ex. 1).\nIn early August 2002, Applicant began medical treatment for chronic pain with a\nlocal physician within a group practice in internal medicine. Detecting an odor of alcohol\nabout Applicant during some office visits, the doctor asked Applicant about his drinking.\nApplicant told the physician on many occasions that his alcohol use was occasional and\nhe never had a problem with alcohol in the past (Ex. 3).  The physician suspected it was\n1\nnot the case. (Ex. 3)\nOn October 26, 2005, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for\ninvestigations processing (e-QIP). In response to question 23.d, \u201cHave you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d, Applicant\nlisted his April 1988 DUI. Concerning any previous clearance investigations (question\n26), Applicant indicated he was granted a confidential-level clearance in June 1984, and\nadded:\nTHERE WAS ALSO AN INVESTIGATION FROM [employer omitted]\nBEFORE SOME ??? FEDERAL C.I.A. THINGY [sic]. I WAS A REBEL\nWITH SAFETY ISSUES THAT I FEEL THEY WOULD RATHER SEE ME\nGONE THAN DEAL WITH \u2018EM. I\u2019M SURE WE\u2019LL TALK SOME MORE\nABOUT THIS SO UNTIL THEN, OH BY THE WAY, I WAS CLEAN (Ex. 1).\nOn March 10, 2007, Applicant responded to alcohol and drug interrogatories from\nDOHA. Applicant admitted he was currently drinking beer (\u201cbeer is my choice\u2013maybe a\nglass of wine for words at a wedding\u201d). He described the frequency of his consumption\nas occasional, during the Super Bowl, and at social events or weddings. He denied\ndrinking to intoxication and indicated that although he had reported to work under the\ninfluence of alcohol and had received treatment due to alcohol, it was \u201csome 15 years\nago.\u201d Applicant responded affirmatively to whether he intended to drink alcoholic\nbeverages in the future, and stated, \u201cAlcohol is a substance in which I can have a few in\nsocial events. Now this is o.k. The need to end up stupid has long past.\u201d Applicant\nexplained he was taking prescribed medication for pain. Being forced to choose\n\n5\nbetween drinking beer and taking his pain medication, he prefers to not be in pain and\ndrinks juice or water most of the time (Ex. 2, Tr. 86).\nOn May 1, 2007, Applicant admitted to his physician during an office visit that he\nhad \u201ca prior addiction to alcohol,\u201d but denied it was an ongoing problem. He admitted to\nstill drinking on occasion. His doctor advised him to refrain from drinking any alcohol.\nApplicant agreed to abstain and to submit to random alcohol testing by his physician\n(Ex. 3). \nAs of January 2008, Applicant was still drinking alcohol \u201conce in a while.\u201d He\nclaimed to have no recall of when he was last intoxicated but estimated it was within the\npast five years. He consumed some punch on December 31, 2007, but not to the point\nwhere he felt \u201cbuzzed\u201d (Tr. 85). He denies consuming more than three beers on any\nsingle occasion in 2007 (Tr. 101). Applicant does not believe he has a problem with\nalcohol currently (Tr. 54, 91). Applicant intends to continue drinking socially, but he sees\nhis social consumption \u201cslowly slipping away\u201d as his medicines are likely to get stronger\n(Tr. 106). Applicant does not foresee losing control over his drinking but should it\nhappen, he would seek professional help (Tr. 52).\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has not seen any indication of Applicant being under the\ninfluence of alcohol at work. He has been comfortable with Applicant and his\nperformance (Ex. B). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set out\nin AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and untrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s underage drinking as a\nteenager led to his arrest on three or four occasions (Tr. 67) and he was fined $50 in\n1978 for drinking in public on the beach (SOR \u00b6 1.a). While an alcohol-related arrest\nraises concerns under AG \u00b6 22(a) (\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d), his abuse was episodic at that time and likely\ndue to his immaturity. \nThe government did not establish that Applicant was impaired by alcohol when\nhe was arrested for disorderly conduct in 1987 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), but that same year,\nApplicant began to abuse alcohol to cope with the death of his mother. Over the next\nfew years, he abused alcohol with significant negative impact on his judgment and\nreliability, as evidenced by two convictions for drunk driving in April 1988 (SOR \u00b61.c)\nand September 1990 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). AG \u00b6 22(a) applies. He also lost a long-held job with\na defense contractor for repeatedly reporting to work under the influence (see \u00b6 22(b)\n(\u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated\nor impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of whether the individual is\n\n7\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d)). The government did not cite\nhis job termination as a specific basis for denial, but it is relevant in that it shows the\npervasiveness of his abuse at that time. Although Applicant did not use the term\n\u201chabitual\u201d to describe his drinking, he admits he lost control over his drinking (\u201cI lost it, I\ndidn\u2019t handle it well for a few years, and that\u2018s when I totally lost control.\u201d Tr. 62). Given\nthe paucity of detail in the record about his consumption, it is difficult to apply AG \u00b6\n22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d).\nInitial attempts to deal with his drinking problem by obtaining alcohol education at\na local hospital (SOR \u00b6 1.g) were not successful, as Applicant did not recognize he had\na problem. After his brother died in 1989, Applicant voluntarily sought inpatient\ntreatment in May and June 1990 (\u00b6 1.h). The rehabilitative success of that program is\ncalled into doubt by his subsequent DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.d), but the record evidence does not\nconfirm the alleged diagnosis of alcohol dependence (see AG \u00b6 22(f) (\u201crelapse after\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation\nprogram\u201d)). Applicant\u2019s pro se response of \u201cI ADMIT\u201d to SOR \u00b6 1.h does not prove the\ndiagnosis, given he would confirm at his hearing only that he had been told he had \u201ca\nproblem,\u201d and he questioned who would have rendered a diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence (Tr. 74-75). While his primary care physician wrote in May 2007 that\nApplicant had required \u201cinpatient treatment for his addiction\u201d in the past (Ex. 3), it is not\nclear whether the physician was making a well-informed diagnosis, generalizing based\non what Applicant told him about his past drinking, or simply repeating Applicant\u2019s\nuntrained characterization of his problem.  The medical records of Applicant\u2019s treatment\nwere not made available for review, although Applicant\u2019s admitted lack of control and\nthe alcohol-related incidents suggest an alcohol abuse problem at a minimum.\nApplicant is credited with completing court-ordered alcohol education in 1991\n(SOR \u00b6 1.i), and admitting himself to a local hospital in 1992 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) when he felt\nhe was going to \u201cgo back into the gutter\u201d (Tr. 78), although he testified that he simply\nwas given a bed for a week. While he resumed drinking after eight months of abstention\nin about 1992, there have been no alcohol-related incidents away from, or at work, in\nthe past 17 years. The Directive provides for mitigation if \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d (AG \u00b6 23(a)). His hospital admission in 1992 when\nhe was not actively abusing alcohol indicates some recognition of a problem and\nwillingness to seek help when needed. AG \u00b6 23(b) applies where \u201cthe individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d \nYet there is credible evidence that Applicant has not always consumed alcohol\nresponsibly since he resumed drinking in about 1992. When asked about his last\nepisode of drinking to intoxication, Applicant responded, \u201cI would say probably less than\nfive years but then the drunk before that was probably about the same amount of\n\n8\nperiod.\u201d (Tr. 88). The government did not prove more recent intoxication. However,\nApplicant\u2019s primary care physician reported in May 2007 that Applicant had an odor of\nalcohol \u201con many occasions\u201d when he came for an office visit (Ex. 3). The physician was\nnot specific as to the dates of the office visits, but it is noted that Applicant has been\nunder this physician\u2019s care only since August 2002. Any drinking by Applicant is against\nmost of the therapeutic advice he has received (Tr. 80), including from his primary care\nphysician (Ex. 3), and is contraindicated with his pain medication. Drinking before\nmedical appointments and in preference to taking his pain medication raises\nconsiderable concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment. Applicant\u2019s failure to abide by his\npromise to his primary care physician that he would abstain from alcohol creates doubt\nabout whether he has the control over his drinking that he claims. Furthermore, doubts\nexist as to whether Applicant has been completely candid with the government about\nhis drinking. His physician, who had no motive to misrepresent, reports that Applicant\nconcealed his alcohol problem from him until May 2007. At his hearing, Applicant\ncharacterized as \u201cludicrous\u201d the concerns his physician expressed about Applicant\ndrinking before office visits (Tr. 90). Applicant has not met his burden of proving that his\nalcohol problem is safely in the past.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s supervisor has detected\nno signs of alcohol about Applicant at work. Yet Applicant continues to drink against the\nadvice of his physician even when the reasons that led him to drink heavily in the past\napparently no longer exist (Tr. 52). His consumption reflects adversely on his judgment\nand presents an unacceptable risk of future abuse.\n\nTreatment completed successfully is viewed favorably. Adverse findings are nonetheless returned as to \u00b6\u00b6\n2\n1.g, 1.h, and 1.i because of his continued irresponsible drinking.\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant2\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nFor the last 11 years, Applicant has had significant debt problems. Twice he has resolved his\nold debts through bankruptcy. Since his last bankruptcy discharge 18 months ago, he has again\nincurred significant unpaid debt. He has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his finances.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to the Motion to Amend the SOR, dated September 26, 2007; Tr. at 8-9.\n1\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated May 23, 2007, at 1-2; Applicant\u2019s supplemental response dated August\n2\n17, 2007 at 1.\nResponse to Motion to Amend, supra note 1, at 1.\n3\nId.\n4\n2\nOn April 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On May 29, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He\nrequested a hearing.  He submitted a second notarized response on August 17, 2007.\nThis matter was assigned to another administrative judge on September 19, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 21, 2007. Due to a personal emergency, DOHA reassigned\nthis case to me on October 10, 2007. I held a hearing on October 16, 2007. The government\nsubmitted government exhibits (GE), 1 through 7, which were marked and admitted into evidence.\nApplicant did not submit any documents into evidence at the hearing, although he testified. The\nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 24, 2007. I held the record open until October 31,\n2007 for the submission of additional evidence by Applicant. He timely submitted 10 documents,\nwhich were marked and admitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe government filed a Motion to Amend the SOR on September 13, 2007 to include\nadditional allegations (1.g through 1.m) under Guideline F. Applicant responded to the allegations\nin writing on September 26, 2007. He did not object to the government\u2019s request to amend the SOR\nin his response or at the hearing. I granted the motion and amended the SOR to include allegations\n1.g through 1.m under Guideline F.1\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i, 1.k and\n1.m of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied the amount owed\n2\nin allegation 1.j.  He denied the remaining allegations.  After a complete review of the evidence in\n3\n4\nthe record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact.\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, signed December 6, 2005) at 2, 7, 8, 14, 17; Tr. at 17-18.\n5\nGE 2 (1997 bankruptcy court docket sheet); Tr. at 19-21, 44-45.\n6\nGE 3 (2000 bankruptcy petition, court docket sheet, and court order); Tr. at 23-24, 27-28, 44-46.\n7\nGE 4 (2003 bankruptcy petition, court docket sheet, and court order); AE I (Copy of banking statements for\n8\n2003); Tr. at 28-30.\nSOR; AE B(Information of rights to withdraw funds from 401K0: AE C(Unsigned 401K withdrawal form);\n9\nAE F ( unpaid medical bill); AE G (Unpaid medical bill); AE H (forbearance documents); Tr. at 32\u201339.\n3\nApplicant, who is 44 years old, works as an associate designer for a Department of Defense\ncontractor and has since May 2004. He is married and has two children, a son age 17 and a daughter\nage 12. He received an associate of arts degree in computer electronics. He completed his security\nclearance application (SF-86) on December 6, 2005.5\nAfter the birth of his daughter in 1995, Applicant\u2019s wife did not return to work. The loss of\nher income caused a strain on their finances. On the advice of a friend, he and his wife decided to\nfile for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1997. Shortly after filing, they concluded that they made a bad\ndecision and decided not to proceed with the bankruptcy. The court closed its case on July 15, 1997.\nThey worked out their debt issues with their creditors. They paid most of their debts. They\nvoluntarily returned one car. He acknowledged at the hearing that a balance remained after the sale\nof the car.6\nIn May 1999, Applicant sustained an on-the-job injury. He did not return to work until\nSeptember 1999. Although he received worker\u2019s compensation benefits until September 1999, he\nagain encountered financial difficulties. By early 2000, his financial situation forced him to file for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.  In an Order dated October 12, 2000, the court discharged his debts of\n$27,000, including the remaining deficiency on the car he voluntarily returned to the dealer.7\nBetween January and June 2003, Applicant experienced problems with delayed electronic\ndeposit of his paycheck by his employer, causing his automatic check payments to be returned, which\ncaused several hundred dollars in bank fees. In July 2003, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter\n13 bankruptcy protection. For the next three years under the auspices of the bankruptcy trustee, they\npaid their debts through monthly payments, which ultimately totaled $24,000. The court entered a\ndischarge order on May 16, 2006 and closed its file on July 24, 2006.8\nSince his last bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has incurred more unpaid debt. Most\nimportantly, he is behind in his payments on his mortgage and his second mortgage. His is one\nmonth behind in his car payment. His total debt on these bills is approximately $5,700. In addition,\nhe owes several smaller bills totaling approximately $300. The primary mortgage holder on his\nproperty agreed to a forbearance plan, which required Applicant to pay $1200 by the end of August\n2007 and an additional $460 a month for six months. Applicant has not provided any documentation\nwhich reflects that he has made these payments. Applicant provided information on obtaining a\nhardship withdrawal from his 401K plan as he intends to use these funds to repay his outstanding\nsecond mortgage debt. He intended to repay the remaining overdue car loan balance of $380 at the\nend of October, but has not provided proof of the payment.9\n\nThese income estimates are based on Applicant\u2019s leave and earnings statements from April 2007 through\n10\nOctober 15, 2007, and his wife\u2019s leave and earnings statements from May 2007 through September 30, 2007.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n15\n4\nApplicant earns $2,575 a month in base pay plus overtime. His net pay for the last six months\n(13 pay checks) averaged $2,924. His wife works for a school system. As a result her monthly\nincome decreases significantly in the summer months. Her average monthly income from May 2007\nthrough September 30, 2007 was $576. During the school year, his wife\u2019s monthly income increases\napproximately $450. Their monthly expenses total approximately $3,950. With his overtime and\nwhen his wife receives her full pay, their monthly income averages approximately $4,000.10\nApplicant\u2019s wife is looking for a better paying position. He is also considering selling his\nhouse or refinancing his mortgage to reduce monthly living expenses.11\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.12\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n13\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n14\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n15\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\n\nISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd., Aug. 10, 1995); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\nISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd.

Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n16\nclearance decision.17\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n18\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n19\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n20\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n21\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individuals\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18.) Applicant has new, significant unpaid debt, and\na history of debt problems for the last eleven years. DC \u00b6 19 (a) inability \u2026 to satisfy debts and DC\n\u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.\nI have carefully reviewed the mitigating conditions under this guideline. MC \u00b6 26 (b) the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances and MC \u00b6 20 (d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts may\nhave some applicability in this case. Applicant\u2019s on-the-job injury in 1999 placed a financial\n\n6\nhardship on the family. Because his finances became unmanageable, he and his wife filed for\nbankruptcy in 2000. The court discharged all their debts, giving them a chance to start over. Within\nthree years, they again had financial problems which necessitated a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing.\nTo their credit, they complied with the repayment plan developed. After three years of payments, the\ncourt entered a discharge order in May 2006. Just over a year after the completion of the latest\nbankruptcy repayment plan, Applicant again has unpaid bills. Although he encountered difficulties\nwith timely electronic payment of his pay in 2003, this factor alone does not account for all his\nfinancial problems, particularly his most recent debts. He has not provided any reason for his current\nfinancial problems, except to state that his wife\u2019s income decreased during the summer months, a\nfactor he knows will occur and for which they should plan, but don\u2019t.\nApplicant contacted his primary mortgagor and made arrangements to repay his overdue\nmortgage debt of nearly $4,000. He also plans to use money from his 401K to repay the monies\nowing on his second mortgage. The arrangements and plans are a step in the right direction. He is\nalso working on bringing his car payments current. He, however, has not provided proof that he has\nactually made any of these payments. Thus, his is entitled to only partial credit for good faith efforts\nto resolve his largest debts.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nApplicant and his wife have encountered financial difficulties for the last 11 years. Twice\nthey have filed for bankruptcy and eliminated their debt through this legal process, one time after\nmaking the required monthly payments for three years. Unfortunately, they have not learned how to\nmanage their finances from this process and are again in debt, primarily as a result of financial\nmismanagement. Considering his age, circumstances beyond his control in the past, the\ncircumstances surrounding his financial problems and his potential for rehabilitation, I find that\nApplicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns. Accordingly, I find against\nApplicant under Guideline F.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-m: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 20, \n2006. On January 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines \nF (Financial) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 31, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non February 11, 2008, and I received the case assignment on February 25, 2008. \nMay 19, 2008\n\n \n2\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 27, 2008, for a hearing on March 14, \n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits (Exh.) which were admitted \nin evidence without objection. Applicant submitted six exhibits which were admitted \nwithout objection. He and one witness testified on his behalf. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 24, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep \nthe record open until April 15, 2008, to submit additional evidence. Two additional \ndocuments were received on April 14, 2008, and admitted without objection. Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \nNotice \nThe hearing notice was dated 15 days before the hearing date. I advised \nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the \nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice and indicated he \nwas ready to proceed (Tr. 9).  \nPleading \n \nThe government conceded that two allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.i. and k) are duplicates \nand withdrew the second (Tr. 7).  \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted eleven of the fourteen allegations \nin the SOR relating to approximately $11,000 in delinquent debts. He denied the other \nthree allegations. He attached copies of letters dated the same date as his answer (Exh. \nD) that he sent to several of the creditors questioning the debts or asking for information \nabout them. He also wrote to three credit reporting agencies on March 8, 2008, a week \nbefore the hearing, regarding duplicate reports and erroneous reports of debts.  \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a government contractor working as a \nlogistics specialist supporting Special Forces since January 2006. He held an interim \nsecurity clearance until this matter arose. He served in the Marine Corps between 1983 \nand 1991 and was honorably discharged as a corporal. He served in Okinawa and in a \nNATO group in the Mediterranean. He served in Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. \nBetween the time of his discharge and his present employment he worked in several \njobs as a cook. He was unemployed for three months in 2003. He has some college \neducation in the culinary field. He took a second job one year ago as a restaurant cook \n\n \n3\nin an effort to earn more and resolve the delinquent debt issues raised in this \nproceeding.  \nApplicant has been married twice. The first was in 1985 and he was divorced in \n1992. He married again in 1994 and was separated in 2003. He is not divorced from his \nsecond wife, but is attempting to do so which is difficult since she lives in another state \nand he has been unable to have much contact with her. He now lives with his fianc\u00e9 \nand they have a three- year-old child. He had medical problems in 2002 and was \noperated and treated for cancer.  \nThe delinquent debts arose from an automobile repossession, and various other \nbills for products and services. A summary of the debts and their status based on \ntestimony reveals the following (Tr. 30-48).  \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a. is for $5,432 arising from an automobile \nrepossession in 2002. It constitutes the largest of the delinquent debts. \nOne credit report does not now list it but the debt is still owed. The \ncreditor has not been in contact with Applicant and when Applicant \nobtains a divorce he hopes any remaining issue will be resolved in a \nfinancial decree apportioning the debt.  \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b. Utility bill for $68 which is unpaid and he is checking \non it with the creditor.  \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c. Satellite dish debt for $256 was settled for $200. \n(Exh. A) \n4, SOR \u00b6 1.d. Gymn membership debt of over $2,000 from a one \nyear membership that he could not cancel when he lost a job. Charges \nhave built up and he has been unable to resolve the issue. He was in \ncontact with a credit counselor on this issue but is not now.  \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e. Telephone bill for $313 which he believed his wife \nhad paid. \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f. Cell phone bill for $649 and his wife took the phone \nwith her when she they separated.  \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g. He is unaware of this debt on the credit report for \n$804 but wrote to the creditor for information.  \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.h. A debt for $281 to a bank where he had a checking \naccount. He is unaware of the source of the debt and has written to the \nbank.  \n\n \n4\n9. SOR \u00b6 1.i. Debt to a video store for $70. He wrote to the \ncompany but the letter was returned (Exh. D). He still has an account with \nthe same company.  \n10. SOR \u00b6 1.j. Cable service debt of $298 but he still has an \naccount with the same company and is unaware of the debt.  \n \n11. SOR \u00b6 1.k. Duplicate of 1.i. Dismissed from SOR by \ngovernment.  \n12. SOR \u00b6 1.l. Medical bill for $561 from hospital where he was \ntreated but was not been billed. He has discussed the debt with the \nhospital and written to them. He believes it is in error but hospital has not \nanswered letter.  \n13. SOR \u00b6 1.m. Medical debt which he paid in full for $137 (Exh. \nB).  \n14. SOR \u00b6 1.n. A medical debt for $165 which he cannot identify. \nHehas written to the creditor butec no response.  \n15.SOR \u00b6 1.o. A dental bill from 2003 which had a balance of $185 \nafter dental insurance paid the remainder. He believed that his wife had \npaid the bill. Paid in full on February 1, 2008 (Exh. C).  \nThus, he has paid only two of the delinquent debts for $357 out of the total \ndelinquent debts of $11,000.  \nIn addition to the above delinquent debts cited in the SOR, Applicant had two \nother debts on which he offered evidence. The first of these was for outstanding student \nloans of $24,000 most of which were consolidated in 2006. He pays $158 per month to \nthe lender (Tr. 62-63). He also pays an additional $50 a month to an attorney who is \ncollecting for the portion that was not consolidated. The second related to dispute and \nclaim of over $1,000 to an apartment complex where he once lived. It was settled for \n$185 on February 1, 2008 (Exh. C).  \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his principal employment is approximately \n$38,000 (Tr. 74). His annual salary from his second job is $15,000 (Tr. 63). With his \nsecond job, he has over $1,000 a month remaining after expenses and deductions (Tr. \n87). He has one automobile which is fully paid (Tr. 88). His fianc\u00e9 owns the home they \nlive in and he pays the mortgage.  \nApplicant is highly regarded by his government contract employer in his \nevaluation and letter of recommendation from his supervisor. (Exh. F and G). His \n\n \n5\nsupervisor at his second job testified favorably about his skills and dedication to the job \n(Tr. 78-85).  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative \nJudge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG & 19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR and \nwas unable or unwilling to pay the obligations for several years. Thus, the evidence \nclearly raises these potentially disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20 (a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Most of \nApplicant=s financial problems arose in the past ten years when he had marital problems \nand low paying jobs in the food service industry. While they have been extant for a \nperiod of time, he has held a job for over two years which pays a reasonable salary and \na second job for over a year that provides supplemental income so he could have made \nmore progress during that time to pay or resolve more of the debts.  \nUnder AG & 20 (b), the security concern also may be mitigating where Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of the financial problems arose from \nhis medical problems and periods of reduced income. He has paid only two of the 15 \ndebts listed in the SOR in the past year. The two debts total only $337 out of the \n$11,000 listed. While some of the debts may not be his responsibility, the issues of \nresponsibility have not be resolved. His efforts to communicate with creditors and the \ncredit agencies was tardy at best. While some of the debts may have arisen for causes \n\n \n7\nbeyond his control, his actions since they became known to him have not been \nresponsible. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20 (c) mitigation by applied if the person has received counseling or \nis receiving it and the problem has been resolved or is under control. Applicant received \nsome counseling for the second largest debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) but dropped it before \nresolution of the debt so this condition is inapplicable.  \nAG & 20 (d) is another mitigating condition that applies where the evidence \nshows the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. While it not necessary for mitigation to apply that all of the delinquent \ndebts be resolved, it is necessary that a significant portion of this many debts be settled \nor paid. I believe this test has not been met. He should have taken steps earlier to \nresolve more of the debts. He has resolved two of the debts that he has been able to \nidentify and authenticate. He has only recently and in anticipation of the hearing \ncommunicated in writing or orally with the other creditors to ascertain the source of the \ndebts. Thus, I conclude that the mitigating conditions do not apply. \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nabove nine factors in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant was employed in the food service for 15 years at low wages during which time \nhe married twice, was divorced once and separated once. He also had some serious \nhealth issues. Although the medical expenses do not seem to have added much to his \nfinancial problems, they complicated his ability to resolve them. The separation from his \n\n \n8\nsecond wife whom he believed was paying the bills was a major element in creating his \nfinancial situation. \nAlthough, he has taken some steps to resolve the delinquent debts and is in a \nposition to do so now with his second job, at this time there has been an insufficient \nshowing of timely responsible action to justify application of the mitigating conditions or \nthe whole person concept. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom these financial considerations and it is premature to grant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.:Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.: Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o.: Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all factual allegations in the SOR. Applicant is a 41-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has held his current position since April 2007. He is single and has no children. The highest level of education he has achieved is one year of junior college. (Tr at 5-6; Gov 1.) On December 5, 2005, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had seven delinquent accounts, with a total approximate balance of $22,991. (Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 4.) Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts include: an $663 medical account placed for collection in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 6); a $2,114 delinquent account placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 8; Gov 3 at 1); a $523 delinquent medical account placed for collection in December 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 6); a $238 delinquent utility account placed for collection in May 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 6); a $14,046 delinquent credit card account placed for collection in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 8; Gov 4 at 3); a $255 delinquent account placed for collection in May 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 4 at 6); and a $5,152 delinquent account placed for collection in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 8; Gov 4 at 4-5).

On March 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 2, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to be proceed on April 9, 2008. \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 19, 2008, and \ntransferred to me on May 21, 2008. On June 5, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, \nscheduling the hearing for July 15, 2008. The case was heard on that date.

The record was held \nopen until July 29, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence. Applicant \ntimely submitted a ten page document that was admitted as AE C without objection. The \ntranscript was received on July 23, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all factual allegations in the \nSOR.   \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance. He has held his current position since April 2007.  He is \nsingle and has no children. The highest level of education he has achieved is one year \nof junior college. (Tr at 5-6; Gov 1.)   \n \nOn December 5, 2005, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). (Gov 1.) A subsequent background investigation \nrevealed that Applicant had seven delinquent accounts, with a total approximate \nbalance of $22,991. (Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 4.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent accounts include: an $663 medical account placed for \ncollection in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 6); a $2,114 \ndelinquent account placed for collection in June 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at 8; Gov 3 at \n1); a $523 delinquent medical account placed for collection in December 2004 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 6); a $238 delinquent utility account placed for collection in \nMay 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 6); a $14,046 delinquent credit card account \nplaced for collection in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 8; Gov 4 at 3); a $255 delinquent \naccount placed for collection in May 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 4 at 6); and a \n$5,152 delinquent account placed for collection in June 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 8; \nGov 4 at 4-5). \n \nMuch of the debt was incurred when Applicant and his live-in girlfriend broke up \nin late 2002. When they split up, each agreed to be responsible for certain debts. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend did not pay the debts that she agreed to pay. Applicant refused \nto pay her debt even though the accounts were in his name. He realizes that he made a \npoor choice and is now attempting the resolve the delinquent accounts. (Tr at 18, 20-21, \n36.) He admits that the medical accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f) are his sole debts. \n(Tr at 43.)   \n \nOn October 7, 2007, Applicant enrolled in a 40-month debt repayment program \nwith a debt consolidation company. He agreed to pay $465 month to the debt \nconsolidation company. The debt consolidation company also advised Applicant on his \nfinances. The payments are deducted automatically from his checking account. He has \nnot missed a payment. (Tr at 17, 19, 22, 29, 44; AE A at 1: AE C at 2-8.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c have been resolved. (AE A at 5-8.) All \nof the Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent accounts are included in his repayment plan. \nThe debt consolidation company negotiated the balance owed with the creditor who \nholds the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The balance owed is now $8,572 as opposed to \n$14,046. (Tr at 25-27; AE A at 1; AE C at 10.)  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $3,062. His total monthly expenses are \n$2,081. This includes his payment to the debt consolidation company. After expenses, \nApplicant has $981 left over in discretionary income. (AE C at 9.) He spends a lot of his \nspare time renovating his house and renovating his parents\u2019 house. He has no open \ncredit card accounts. (Tr at 32, 34, 45.) \n  \nSeveral reference letters were submitted on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They include \nletters from a criminal investigator in the local district attorney\u2019s office, the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives in Applicant\u2019s state; and the Sheriff of the county where \nApplicant resides. These letters attest to Applicant\u2019s clean criminal record. (AE B at 1-2, \n4.) Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor who is also the Facility Security Officer of the \ncompany wrote a letter on his behalf. He states that Applicant is consistent in his work \nethic. He describes Applicant as a take-charge person who is able to present creative \nideas and communicate the benefits. He recommends Applicant for a security clearance \nnoting that he is a team player whose character and ethics are above reproach. (AE B \nat 3.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC & 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since 2002, Applicant has incurred \napproximately seven delinquent debts, an approximate total of $22,991. Most of his \nfinancial issues resulted from an unwillingness to pay the debts that he believed were \nhis ex-girlfriend\u2019s debts. He was capable of paying the debts. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is partially applicable. \nApplicant initially refused to pay several debts because he thought they were his ex-\ngirlfriend\u2019s responsibility. He now admits he used poor judgment by refusing to pay \nthese debts and has taken steps to resolve the accounts. He has consistently made  \npayments to a debt consolidation company over the past nine months. The debts are \nstarting to be resolved.  However, five of the seven debts remain unresolved so this \nmitigating condition is given less weight.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Most of the debts became \ndelinquent because Applicant refused to pay the debts that he thought were his ex-\ngirlfriend\u2019s responsibility even though the accounts were in his name. Applicant was \ncapable of paying these debts so FC MC \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) applies. The debt consolidation company that Applicant entered into an \nagreement with also provided him with some financial counseling.  He now follows a \nbudget. He has demonstrated that he is capable of paying the monthly payment to the \ndebt consolidation company and pay his other bills. His financial situation is stable and it \nis likely Applicant will resolve his delinquent accounts based on his seven month history \nof timely payments to the debt consolidation company. Two of the accounts have been \nresolved.  He lives within his means. \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts) applies. Although Applicant initially refused to pay these debts \nbecause he believed they were his ex-girlfriend\u2019s debts, he eventually accepted his \nresponsibility to repay the delinquent accounts and entered into a repayment agreement \nwith a debt consolidation company. He has followed the terms of the agreement since \nNovember 2007. He has demonstrated that he is financially able to make his payments \nunder the plan and pay his other expenses.  \n \nGuideline F is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n6 \n \n \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nreferences, and his efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts.  While Applicant has not \nresolved all of his delinquent accounts, he has demonstrated that he has taken efforts to \nresolve his delinquent accounts and is financially able to do so. Applicant accepts \nresponsibility for his foolish decision not to pay these accounts out of anger at his ex-\ngirlfriend. Applicant has established a track record demonstrating his intent to resolve \nthe issues raised under financial considerations. Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his three alcohol-related arrests between\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Tr., 98.\n2\n Gx. 1.\n3\n Ax. A.\n4\n2\n2000 and 2005. He has greatly moderated his drinking and altered his personal circumstances so that\nhe leads a more responsible lifestyle. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.\n1\nOn April 30, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that\nraise security concerns about his use of alcohol and related criminal conduct.\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a decision without a hearing. On June\n4, 2007, Department Counsel timely requested a hearing in accordance with Section 3.1.7 of the\nDirective. The case was assigned to me on June 20, 2007, and I convened a hearing on July 26, 2007,\nat which the parties appeared as scheduled. I admitted the three exhibits proffered by the government\n(Gx. 1- 3). Applicant testified in his own behalf, but offered no exhibits at hearing. DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.) on August 3, 2007. Additionally, I left the record open after the hearing to afford\nApplicant additional time to submit information in support of his case.  The record closed on August\n2\n3, 2007, when I admitted, without objection by Department Counsel, Applicant\u2019s timely post-hearing\nsubmission marked as Ax. A.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as facts. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is 32 years old and employed since October 2003 as a computer technician by a\ndefense contractor. From August 2000 until September 2003, he occupied the same position at the\nsame facility, but for a different contractor. He has held a security clearance since about September\n1995, when he worked as an office clerk for a defense contractor. In 2003 and 2004, he attended\ncommunity college to obtain various information technology (IT) certifications.  Applicant has\n3\nachieved numerous qualifications at work, has completed a broad range of training requirements, and\nhas been cited for excellent work by his employer and his government customer.4\nApplicant has been charged with and convicted of alcohol-related offenses on three\noccasions. On May 20, 2000, he was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and\nreckless driving after an initial breathalyser showed he had a .26% blood alcohol content (BAC). A\n\n Gx. 3.\n5\n Gx. 2.\n6\n Gx. 2; Tr., 75 - 81, 88.\n7\n Gx. 2; Tr., 42, 56 - 57, 59.\n8\n Gx. 2; Tr.,  \n9\n3\ntest later the same evening showed a .19% BAC. He later pleaded guilty to DUI and the reckless\ndriving charge was dismissed. He was ordered to attend a 10-week alcohol safety awareness program\n(ASAP), which included attendance at a single Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting. Applicant was\nalso fined and his driver\u2019s license was restricted for one year.  Although his alcohol use was\n5\nevaluated during ASAP, the program is not a treatment or counseling program. Rather, it is intended\nto educate offenders about the effects of alcohol, with emphasis on the dangers of alcohol abuse and\ndrinking and driving.\nOn June 29, 2004, Applicant was a passenger in his friend\u2019s car. When they stopped at a local\nconvenience store, Applicant remained in the car while his friend went inside. When a sheriff\u2019s\ndeputy approached the car and spoke with him, the deputy smelled alcohol and asked Applicant to\nget out of the car. Applicant was given a breathalyser test, which registered a .13% BAC. Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with being drunk in public. He later pleaded guilty and was fined $50.6\nOn March 31, 2005, Applicant drove himself and a friend to a local bar. Applicant planned\nto wait there until his girlfriend was dropped off after a movie. She would then drive them home.\nWhen Applicant and his passenger arrived, the latter got into another friend\u2019s car to drink a few beers\nbefore going into the bar. Applicant, who had not yet had anything to drink, went into the bar. Less\nthan an hour later, police arrived looking for a car similar to Applicant\u2019s that had been used in a\ncrime. Applicant, who had already consumed at least four drinks, went out to the parking lot in\nresponse to the officer\u2019s inquiries about his car. The officer gave Applicant a field sobriety test,\nwhich he failed, and a breathalyser, which registered a .28% BAC. Applicant was charged with being\ndrunk in public and with DUI. When he appeared in court, Applicant pleaded guilty to the drunk in\npublic charge, but the DUI was dismissed because the arresting officer had no way of knowing if\nApplicant had been drinking before he drove to the bar.7\nApplicant first drank alcohol in 1996, when he was about 21 years old. He started out\ndrinking beer, but later adopted whiskey and coke as his drink of choice. He estimates he was\nintoxicated about eight times between 1996 and 2004, but generally drank in moderation during that\nperiod. When he was arrested for DUI in 2000, it was the first time he had driven after drinking more\nthan one or two drinks. He has not driven after drinking since the DUI arrest.8\nApplicant lived with his parents until he was about 28 years old. In 2004, he moved into a\ntownhouse with three friends and started running in circles where partying was commonplace. When\nhe was not working, he was either at home or out at restaurants, bars, and clubs with his roommates\nand other friends several times each month. He estimates he was intoxicated as often as three  times\neach month between 2004 and 2005.  Since his March 2005 arrest for being drunk in public,\n9\n\n Tr., 89 - 90, 66.\n10\n Tr., 65, 90 - 92.\n11\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President\n12\non December 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are as follows: 1. Nature and seriousness\n13\nof the conduct and surrounding circumstances; 2. Frequency and recency of the conduct; 3. Age of the applicant; 4.\nMotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with\nknowledge of the consequences involved; 5. Absence or presence of rehabilitation; and 6. Probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n14\n4\nApplicant has moderated his drinking. Between that arrest and his subject interview with a\ngovernment investigator in May 2006, Applicant thinks he was intoxicated three or four times. He\nlast drank liquor in December 2006. The next (and last) time he drank any alcohol was in April\n2007.10\nOn February 1, 2007, Applicant and his girlfriend moved into a room in a house her sister\nand brother-in-law owned. The house is a suburb of the city where Applicant previously lived, and\nhe has adopted a quieter lifestyle there. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend, her sister, and brother-in-law do not\ndrink. Applicant enjoys staying home more and occupying his time by fishing, bowling, and other\nmore sedate activities than before.11\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nSecurity clearance decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions under each adjudicative guideline  applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.\n12\nEach decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed\nin Section 6.3 of the Directive.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition\n13\nis not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent\npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this case, the\npleadings and the information presented by the parties at hearing require that Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines G (alcohol consumption) and J (criminal conduct) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n14\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate\nthe government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n15\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n16\n \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse\n17\nabuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d\n \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\n18\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\u201d\n \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances\n19\nthat it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d\n5\nheavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n15\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.16\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlcohol Consumption. The government alleged that Applicant drank alcohol, at times to\nexcess, between 1996 and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was convicted of DUI after an arrest on May\n20, 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he was arrested for and pleaded guilty to a charge of drunk in public in\nJune 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that, in March 2005, he was arrested for and pleaded guilty to a charge\nof drunk in public (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The government submitted sufficient information, along with\nApplicant\u2019s admissions, to support the SOR allegations. The facts thus established by the available\ninformation\u2013three alcohol-related arrests and instances of excessive consumption between 1996 and\n2006\u2013raise a security concern addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines at \u00b6 21; that is,\n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d\nMore specifically, the disqualifying conditions (DC) in  \u00b6 22(a)  and \u00b6 22(c)  must be considered.\n17\n18\nIn response to the government\u2019s information, Applicant asserts he has moderated his drinking\nand alcohol no longer plays a major role in his life. Further, Applicant\u2019s heaviest alcohol\nconsumption occurred between 2004 and 2005, after he moved out of his parents\u2019 home and while\nhe associated mostly with friends who liked to go out drinking. Combined with the fact his last\nalcohol-related misconduct occurred more than two years ago, Guideline G mitigating condition\n(MC) 23(a)  must be considered. Applicant\u2019s personal life has changed sufficiently that he now is\n19\nless likely to find himself in the same circumstances that led to his alcohol abuse and related\nmisconduct. I conclude this guideline for the Applicant.\nCriminal Conduct. The government also alleged the conduct specified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.d\nconstitutes criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The same information that establishes the facts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.b - 1.d, also establishes SOR \u00b6 2.a. These facts raise a security concern addressed in the Revised\n\n \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d\n20\n \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n21\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d\n \u201c (1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\n22\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) The individual's age and maturity\nat the time of the conduct; (5) The extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) The presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) The motivation for the conduct; (8) The potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; (9) The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\n Directive, 6.3. \n23\n6\nAdjudicative Guidelines at \u00b6 30; that is: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.

Applicant\u2019s\n21\nlast criminal offense occurred more than two years ago, and the circumstances underlying that\nmisconduct are no longer present. I conclude this guideline for the Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts and have applied the appropriate adjudicative\nfactors, pro and con, under Guidelines G and J. I have also reviewed the record in the context of the\nwhole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Applicant is\n22\nnow in his 30s and has learned, albeit later than most, that he cannot continue to live the same\nlifestyle as someone in college or their early 20s, especially when holding a security clearance. To\nhis credit, he no longer drinks to excess and has changed his circumstances by moving away from\nfriends and associates with whom his socialization involved drinking alcohol. He now lives a\ndomesticated life in a different location, and he has matured in his choice of priorities. Combined\nwith the passage of time since his last alcohol-related misconduct, there is little likelihood the\nadverse information in Applicant\u2019s background will recur. A fair and commonsense assessment  of\n23\nall available information shows that the Applicant has overcome the doubts about his ability to\nexercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one who holds a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol):         \nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the available information about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nEdward G. Lear, Esquire\nCentury Law Group\nSYNOPSIS\nThis 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor has a sparse history of three instances of\npersonal and lesser criminal activity while in college and in 1998 and 2004.  His current maturity is\nindicated by his excellent work history, letters of recommendation and three years without any\nrecurrence.  Mitigation has been established.  Clearance is granted. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nOn June 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \nOn July 19, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made after a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. The matter was\nassigned to me on September 12, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 9, 2007, setting\nthe hearing for November 8, 2007. At the hearing, the Government introduced three (3) exhibits\n(Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 1-3). Applicant testified and introduced exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(AX). The transcript was received at DOHA on November 26, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 35-year-old industrial engineer. The June 14, 2007 SOR contains two (2)\nallegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and two (2) allegations under Guideline J\n(Criminal Conduct).  Applicant\u2019s responses are a combination of admissions and denials, along with\ncomments and explanations.  Only the specific admissions are accepted and incorporated herein as\nFindings of Fact.  After  considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n1.a. While in college in 1996-2000 (ages 24-28), Applicant\u2019s roommate vacated their joint\nresidence and left behind a TV satellite dish, whish contained a \"card\" that allowed access to the\nsatellite network.  He purchased another dish and card on E-bay. In about July 2001, he attempted\nto sell the equipment on his company\u2019s computer network, which apparently allowed employees to\nadvertise personal items for sale.  Applicant knew that at least the \"cards\" could not legally be sold,\nsince they allowed access to the satellite network without having to pay the satellite company.\n1.b. the attempted sale was detected by company security.  Applicant admitted what he was\ndoing and was terminated by the company in July 2001 because of the improper use of the computer\nnetwork to sell the \"illegal\" cards. \nGuideline J (Criminal Activity) \n2.a. In about June 1998, Applicant was working as a checker in a food market. A friend came\ninto his line and Applicant intentionally did not charge the friend for 10-15 items. This conduct was\nobserved by store security and resulted in Applicant\u2019s arrest. He was charged with Misdemeanor/Petty\nTheft and pleaded nolo contendere to the charge. He was fined, placed on probation for three years\nand sentenced to serve one day in jail. \n2.b. In or about August 2004, Applicant was arrested for driving a boat on a local lake, while\nunder the influence of alcohol. He pleaded No Contest and was fined, placed on probation for two\nyears, and ordered to attend an alcohol awareness class. \n\n3\nPOLICIES \nThe eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6\nrequire an analysis under the whole person concept, which requires DOHA Administrative Judge s\nto identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question\nof whether it is \"clearly consistent with the national interest\" for an individual to hold a security\nclearance. An applicant\u2019s admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the\nGovernment of having to prove those allegations. If specific allegations and/or information are denied\nor otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those\ncontroverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, under the Directive\u2019s \"whole person\"\nconcept, the adjudicator should consider the following nine generic factors: (1). The nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3). The frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (Directive, Enclosure 2, Section 2, on pages 18, 19). I have considered all nine factors,\nindividually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion. \nIf the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant\u2019s admissions or by other\nevidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the Directive, the burden of \npersuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the\nDirective, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant. \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,\n\"any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of\nnational security will be resolved in favor of the nation\u2019s security.\"\nCONCLUSIONS \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant used his company computer to attempt to sell two \"satellite\nprogramming cards\" from satellite equipment not legitimately purchased by him. He was terminated\nby his employer because of this conduct. \nDisqualifying Conditions - applicable are 16.( c) credible adverse information in several\nadjudicative areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut when considered as a whole, supports a whole person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating the person may not properly safeguard protected information; \n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline\nand may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\n\n4\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\nor other characteristics indicating the person may not properly safeguard protected information. This\nincludes but is not limited to consideration of the following: \n(2) . . . inappropriate behavior in the workplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation; \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of . . . other employer\u2019s time or resources. \nMitigating Conditions - 17.( c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) - The Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n2.a..  As to the 1998 arrest, the SOR allegation that Applicant was charged with Grand Theft\nis derived from the FBI Identification record (GX 3).  There are two entries for that year,\n\"1998/05/19,\" which cited \u201cPetty Theft\" and \u201c1998/06/03,\u201d which cites \"Grand Theft.\"  Both entries\nare captioned \"Arrested Or Received.\"  As I read the two entries and those for the 2004 arrest as well,\nit is clear that the first entry was for the day the arrest was reported and the second entry was the date\nthe court action occurred.  The second entry does say \"Grand Theft.\"  FBI Identification Records are\ngenerally, but not always, correct.  They are only as accurate as the information transmitted to the FBI\nand the correct transfer of that information onto the Identification Record. \nApplicant denies he was charged with Grand Theft.  His contention is supported by an official\ncourt document.  Attached to Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR is the Complaint, the official charging\ndocument.  Count 1 alleges that Applicant committed Petty Theft, a Misdemeanor, on March 15,\n1998.  The Complaint was signed and date stamped on April 16, 1998.  The \u201cGrand Theft\" entry in\nthe FBI History, dated \"1998/06/03\" is unsupported by any original evidence and is incorrect.  I\nconclude that the arrest and conviction was for a misdemeanor. \n2.b. The August 2004 offense occurred as alleged. Applicant was in a friend\u2019s speed boat and\nhad consumed about eight beers during the day. The friend asked Applicant to drive the boat while\nhe, the friend, used the water ski. The boat\u2019s erratic movements were observed by a Deputy Sheriff\nand Applicant was stopped.\n \nDisqualifying Conditions include 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n31.( c) an allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted, are both applicable.  Applicable Mitigating Conditions\ninclude 32.(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 32.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation,\nincluding, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement. \nOn three occasions in Applicant\u2019s life of 35 years, he used poor judgment in making decisions\ninvolving his personal conduct: the 1998 Petty Theft; the 2001 misuse of a company computer, which\n\n5\nled to his termination, and the 2004 DUI Watercraft arrest and conviction.  Without meaning to\nminimize Applicant\u2019s personal and criminal misconduct, the three incidents involve different types\nof misconduct, most of which can all be classified as relatively minor, unconnected, and the result\nof decisions made without reasonable consideration.  Overall, Applicants personal history suggests\nan extended period of immaturity that substantially ended some years ago, as is demonstrated by his\nexcellent work record and letters of commendation.\nUnder the two specific Guidelines and the Directive\u2019s whole person concept, Applicant has\nbeen shown to have a history of one act of personal misconduct during 1996-2000; and two \"lesser\"\ncriminal offenses, in 1998 and 2004.  Since 1998, the only incident is one of operating a boat on a\nlake while under the influence of alcohol, conduct that Applicant credible regrets.  There is no other\nevidence of alcohol abuse or alcohol-related misconduct.  Consequently, the 2004 arrest appears to\nbe an aberration in a life otherwise free of alcohol-related problems.  Overall, I conclude that\nApplicant has adequately mitigated the Government\u2019s concerns\nIn summary, Applicant has demonstrated that he currently possesses the good judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness required of someone seeking access to the nation\u2019s secrets. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor the Applicant\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor the Applicant\nDECISION \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nBARRY M.

He also mitigated financial\nsecurity concerns arising from less than $4,000 in delinquent debts. He earns $55,000 per year since\nhis graduation. He paid one of the major debts six months before the hearing and entered negotiation\nfor the remaining two which now total less than $3,000. He also mitigated allegation of failure to\nreport as use of an alias the use of a friend\u2019s drivers license without his permission when his own\nlicense was suspended. He credibly established that this was not a deliberate omission. Clearance\nis granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nOn September 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a\nhearing. The matter was assigned to me on January 8, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on\nJanuary 10, 2007, for a hearing on January 26, 2007, and held that day. The government and\nApplicant each offered nine exhibits into evidence, and all were accepted. The record was left open\nfor 30 days. Applicant offered three additional exhibits that were admitted without objection. The\ntranscript was received on February 6, 2007 \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted some and denied some of the SOR allegations relating to criminal\nconduct, delinquent debts, and personal conduct with explanatory information for all. After a\ncomplete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old engineer who has worked for a major defense contractor since\nAugust 2005 after he graduated from a leading U.S. engineering school with an outstanding\nacademic record. He had a double major in aerospace engineering and physics and is working on a\nmasters degree while being employed full time.

He plead and was\nfined $253 for one count of resisting arrest. \nApplicant was alleged in the SOR to have four delinquent debts totaling nearly $4,000\nincurred during his student years. He is contesting the smallest debt of $102 for a telephone bill\n(SOR \u00b6 1.2.a.) but will pay the debt if it cannot be resolved. He has been in contact with the credit\ncard creditors for two delinquent debts of $1,849 and $877 (SOR \u00b6 1.b and c.) He paid the fourth\ndelinquent debt of $1,452 (SOR \u00b6 1.d.) six months before the hearing (Exh. E). He has paid several\nother delinquent debts including fines and court costs not alleged in the SOR over the past years both\nbefore and since his present employment. These amounted to several thousand dollars in excess of\nthose alleged in this matter (Exhs. 7, E, and I).\nApplicant used a friend\u2019s drivers license without his permission in connection with his 2002\narrest (SOR 1.a.). He did not have a valid license at that time because his had been suspended for\ntraffic violations. He did not state this use of another\u2019s name on his Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations (e-QIP) processing for a security clearance in 2005 in response to a question about\nusing names other than his own as an alias as he did not interpret this conduct as using an \u201calias\u201d.\nApplicant\u2019s background indicates a long struggle with family adversity. He and his brother\nwere principal care-givers for their mother who was a single mother who suffered from mental\nproblems. They literally raised themselves. Applicant had behavioral difficulties in his youth with\nanger and authority figures. He dropped out of high school in his senior year but obtained his GED\nand was admitted to college through a state sponsored special program for educationally and\nfinancially disadvantaged students who show promise. Both he and his brother are graduate\nengineers and excelled even beyond the program\u2019s expectations. Both have radically changed their\nlife-style and have promising careers ahead of them (Exhibit C Post hearing submission). \nThe annual salary of Applicant is $55,000. He has no dependents but continues to provide\nfinancial assistance to his mother. His financial obligations consist primarily of monthly rent of $825\nand payments on a three year old auto of $512 per month. He has school loans that are deferred\npending completion of his graduate studies. He has adequate funds to resolve his remaining\noutstanding delinquent debts and is in the process of doing so. He has been in touch with financial\ncounseling services but has not yet engaged their services (Exh. B Post hearing submission).\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisor (Exh. C) who deem him to be an excellent and\nwell motivated employee. His academic supervisors and deans at his university submitted strong\ncharacter and professional recommendations for him extolling his record of achievement, motivation,\nand good character (Exhs. A, B, and Post hearing submission C). In addition to his graduate studies,\nhe serves as a tutor for other students at his university. \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nSecurity concerns were raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) over the three arrests\nthat occurred four to eight years ago. The allegations could be mitigated by the fact that the criminal\nbehavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1.), the factors leading to the violations are not likely to recur\n(E2.A10.1.3.4), and there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.3.6.). He\nacknowledged his responsibility for the offenses, paid fines and has since changed his life style and\nno longer associates with the same people with whom he knew during that period. I conclude\nApplicant\u2019s behavior and is mitigated by the passage of time, his lack of contact with those with\nwhom he knew in college and his successful rehabilitation. \nApplicant\u2019s four delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concern under\nGuideline F since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence\nof inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) \nMitigating Conditions (MC) include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (E2.A6.1.3.3.), the person has received or is receiving\n\n5\ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control (E2.A6.1.3.4.), and the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.). \nThe evidence that the debts resulted from conditions beyond his control include the fact that\nthey accumulated during his youthful student days when he had limited income, financial\nrequirements, and more credit cards than he could manage. He has repaid one of the two\nlargestdelinquent debts as well as other large debts he incurred in his college years. He has not\nengaged credit counseling although he indicated he had a need for those services at the hearing and\nin his Post Hearing submission Exh. B. He has been in touch with credit counselors but has not\nfinalized their services. He intends to do so no matter the outcome of this matter because he\nrecognizes that he needs to achieve a good credit rating for future endeavors. \nApplicant acknowledged having made financial mistakes and agreed that he must resolve the\nremaining debts. He has initiated good faith efforts to repay the creditors and has reduced the\ndelinquent debt substantially with only approximately $2,700 remaining to two creditors with efforts\nto settle or pay those. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to report his use of another person\u2019s drivers license when he was 21years\nold as his use of an alias on his e-QIP raised issues under Guideline E that might indicate\nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and\ncould indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.).\nSpecifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from\na personnel security application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.)\nWhile the arrest relating to drug possession and use of a false drivers license in 2002 were\nserious offenses for someone who had reached maturity, he was found guilty and punished for them\n(Exh. 7). Whether he should have realized that the use of the improperly obtained drivers license in\n2002 would be deemed by the government as use of an \u201calias\u201d when filling out his form is\nproblematic. I find his testimony that he had no intent to falsify to be credible (Tr. 66-67). Thus, I\nconclude that the omission of an admission about use of an alias on the application was not\ndeliberate as required by the guideline and thus mitigated. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\nestablished that he is now a hard-working professional whose juvenile conduct several years ago is\nnow behind him. His debts accumulated during his student days to the point that he had lost control\nand account of them but will resolve them satisfactorily now that he has the financial means to do\nso. The impressive submissions from his corporate supervisor and his advisors at his university speak\nextremely well of him as a person of growth and character. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \n\n6\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude a security clearance should be granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess. Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n Applicant was advised on page 69 of the transcript (Tr. 69) of the time period he had to submit additional\n1\nexhibits.. \n2\nApplicant\u2019s one-time contact with his sister, a resident citizen of Lebanon, in the last 31 years\nreduces his potential for foreign influence to a very manageable level that does not render him a\nsecurity risk. His criminal conduct is mitigated by his character evidence and the passage of about\n15 years without recurrence of criminal behavior. However, his character evidence is insufficient to\novercome the deliberate omission of the 1992 felony charge and the 20 debts (over 180 days\ndelinquent) from his security form in November 2004. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn March 5, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as reissued through Change 4\nthereto, dated April 20, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant indicating that\nbased on foreign influence (Guideline B), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and personal conduct\n(Guideline E), DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. On March 22, 2007,\nApplicant provided a typewritten response to every factual allegation of the SOR. This typewritten\nanswer was notarized on March 23, 2007, and received by DOHA on March 27, 2007. Applicant also\nfurnished an undated handwritten response (answers to each allegation written on the SOR) that was\nreceived by DOHA on April 23, 2007. \nOn June 29, 2007, this case was assigned to me. On July 10, 2007, this case was scheduled\nfor hearing on August 1, 2007. The Government submitted four exhibits (GE), and Applicant\nsubmitted one exhibit (AE). All exhibits were admitted in evidence. Testimony was taken from\nApplicant. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 10, 2007. I received two character exhibits\nafter the hearing between September 6 and September 8, 2007. Even though the exhibits were not\nsubmitted by August 16, 2007,  Department Counsel stated she had no objection to exhibits being\n1\nadmitted in evidence. The two character exhibits are admitted in evidence. \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nAt the hearing, the Government moved to amend subparagraph 2.b. by deleting the words\n\u201cfor striking your spouse in the head/face with a hammer.\u201d Pursuant to E3.1.17. of the Directive, the\nmotion was granted. (Tr. 79) The allegation shall read \u201cOn or about June 12, 1992, you were arrested\nin [county], [state] and charged with aggravated battery, a felony. On June 28, 1992, the charge was\ndismissed.\u201d \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant is 48 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He is married with three\nchildren. He was born in Lebanon in April 1959. He has been a resident of the United States since\napproximately 1976. He received his US citizenship in March 1983.\nThe SOR contains allegations addressing foreign influence, criminal conduct, and personal\nconduct. Applicant admitted his 52-year old sister is a resident citizen of Lebanon as alleged under\nforeign influence (Guideline B). Applicant admitted subparagraphs 2.a and 2.c. In his typewritten\nanswer (March 22, 2007), Applicant admitted subparagraph 2.b. (including the fact that the\naggravated battery was a felony), but noted in the response that the reference in the allegation about\nstriking his wife with a hammer was incorrect. In his handwritten answer to subparagraph 2.b., he\nsimply denied the entire allegation. At the hearing, Applicant stated his daughter assisted him in the\npreparation of his typed answer, and he reread the answer before having it notarized. Also, at the\nhearing, Applicant recalled an undercover police officer (not a shoplifter) was in his store. Applicant\nshoved the officer against a newsstand when the officer would not leave the store. He was arrested\nand charged with aggravated battery. After his arrest, he hired a lawyer. He did not recall having to\nreturn to court. Though he recalled being arrested for aggravated battery (Tr. 39), he testified he did\nnot believe he had been charged with a felony. (Tr. 44) I find Applicant was arrested for aggravated\nbattery, a felony. \nApplicant denied he intentionally omitted any information (subparagraphs 3.a., 3.b., and 3.c.)\nfrom his security clearance application (date stamped on the first page November 3, 2004) he signed\non November 9, 2004. \nForeign Influence. Applicant\u2019s sister was born in Lebanon (GE 1) in August 1955. After\nspending her first 14 years in her birth country, she married and moved to the Ivory Coast of Africa\nwhere she remained for about 35 years. She also gave birth to four children. Three of the four\nchildren are now US citizens. The fourth child returned with Applicant\u2019s sister to Lebanon about\nthree years ago. While she was in Africa, she and her husband owned a shoe factory, though she is\nnot certain of the size of the factory. Applicant\u2019s sister is currently unemployed in Lebanon.\nApplicant has never contacted his sister directly. However, he gets information about her through\nher daughter who is a US citizen. The last time he actually had face-to-face contact with his sister\nwas about 12 years ago after their father passed. (Tr. 34) Applicant has never provided monetary\nsupport for her. (Tr. 35) \nAccording to GE 1, Applicant\u2019s parents are deceased. Five of Applicant\u2019s seven siblings are\nUS citizens. Applicant has been married to his wife since 1986; she became an US citizen in 1997.\nThey have three children, all born and living in the US. \nCriminal Conduct. On December 18, 1990, Applicant and his wife began arguing in front\nof guests. His daughter interceded. Applicant struck his wife and daughter (subparagraph 2.a.). The\npolice were called and arrested Applicant for battery of his wife and daughter. His wife had her\ncharges and her daughter\u2019s charges dropped.\nOn November 22, 2001, Applicant was arrested for domestic battery (subparagraph 2.c.), A\nmisdemeanor. During a religious holiday known for fasting and sacrifice, Applicant accused his wife\nof talking about a forbidden subject in his presence. He struck her and was charged with battery; the\nbattery charge was dismissed on condition he complete 12 hours of anger management. Upon\n\n Applicant was furnished additional time to submit information about the status of the debts. While two\n2\ncharacter statements were admitted in evidence, no information concerning the debts was provided. \n4\ncompletion of the classes, the charges were dropped. (Tr. 45) On June 12, 1992, Applicant testified\nhe was in his store when an undercover officer tried to sell him a video. The officer would not leave\nthe store, and Applicant pushed him against a newsstand inside the Applicant was arrested for\naggravated battery, a felony (subparagraph 2.b.). On June 28, 1992, the charges were dismissed.\nPersonal Conduct. On November 9, 2004, Applicant signed an security clearance\napplication (SCA) certifying the information within the SCA was true and accurate. Applicant\ndeliberately falsified subparagraph 3.a. by failing to disclose he had been charged with a felony in\nresponse to question 21. See, SOR, 2.b., Applicant\u2019s typed answer, and GE 2. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation that he did not know he had been charged with a felony is not credible due to his typed\nanswer to subparagraph 2.b., that he reread and had notarized, where he admitted the criminal\noffense was a felony. \nSubparagraph 3.b. (question 26 of this SCA) requires information concerning arrests, charges\nand convictions in the last 7 years from November 9, 2004, the date Applicant signed the SCA.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d Because subparagraph 2.c. occurred outside the seven year window, his\nnegative answer is correct, and a favorable finding is warranted.\nSubparagraph 3.c. (question 38 of his SCA) requires disclosure of information about debts\nin the last 7 years that are over 180 days delinquent. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question,\nfalsely asserting he had no debts over 180 days delinquent. GE 3 and 4 show that when he signed\nthe SCA in November 2004, he had 20 debts over 180 days delinquent. In his typewritten answer\nto the SOR, Applicant indicated he had taken steps to resolve the debts. At the hearing, Applicant\nconceded he knew about one or two debts being over 180 days delinquent  at the time he furnished\nthe SCA, but he did not think the overdue debts were important. Applicant provided other\nexplanations for the debts, including that some debts belonged to the business, and his wife paid\nsome of the debts. The lack of documentation  undermines and weakens Applicant\u2019s claims for\n2\nomitting the information. I find he deliberately omitted material information from the security form\nin November 2004. \nFrom 1987 to 1993, Applicant owned a convenient store that closed when he ran out of\ncapital to maintain the store. From 2001 to 2004, he operated a used car business that terminated\nwhen he no longer had the capital. From October 2004 to the present, Applicant has been employed\nas an interpreter for a defense contractor. Applicant has performance evaluations but declined to\nfurnish them in the record. \nA military official indicated in an undated letter (dated August 27, 2007 in the lower right-\nhand corner of the exhibit) that he worked with Applicant in linguistics and interpreting for October\n2006 through January 2007. In that period, the official carefully observed Applicant\u2019s\nprofessionalism and excellent teaching capabilities. Another military official stated by letter dated\nJune 15, 2005 that in the period from April 1, 2005 through July 15, 2005, that through his steadfast\ndevotion to his linguistic assignments, lives have been saved. \n\n5\nI have taken official notice of the US Department State documents, including consular\ninformation sheets, terrorism reports, and human rights reports. These reports indicate Lebanon has\na long history of civil unrest. After having experienced civil war between the early 1970s and 1992,\nthe country experienced a relative degree of stability until the early 2000s when the country was\nagain struck by internal strife. Currently, the government is forcefully trying to expel one of two\ninternationally recognized terrorist organizations that continue to destabilize the parliamentary\ndemocracy. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties, and may be manipulated into helping a foreign entity at the expense of the US. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nCriminal behavior raises serious questions about a person\u2019s judgment and ability to comply\nwith the law, rules and regulations. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nExhibiting poor judgment or dishonesty during a security investigation raises doubt\nconcerning a person\u2019s judgment and trustworthiness. \n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence (FI). The familial connection Applicant has to his sister invokes FI\ndisqualifying condition 7.b. (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information) due to the sibling relationship between Applicant and his sister, a\nresident citizen of Lebanon. This connection could create a potential for conflict between Applicant\u2019s\nobligations as an interpreter and a potential desire to help his sister, or a group or a country. \nThe record conclusively shows that Applicant\u2019s contacts with his older sister have been\nminimal over the years at best. In the last 31 years, he has had no communication or contact with her\nexcept for the face-to-face contact they had at their father\u2019s funeral 12 years ago. While there has\nbeen no change in direct communication with his sister in the last three years, Applicant receives\nupdates about his sister\u2019s health status via contacts with her daughter (a US citizen) living in the\nmidwestern part of the US.\nApplicant has been a US citizen for the past 27 years. In that time, he has owned a\nconvenience store for six years and a used auto lot from 2001 to 2004. Currently, he is a\nlinguist/cultural advisor for a defense contractor. He has held that position since October 2004.  Five\nof Applicant\u2019s seven siblings are US citizens. Applicant has been married to his US wife since 1986.\nAll three of Applicant\u2019s children were born in the US. Considering the total lack of meaningful or\nemotional contact between Applicant and his sister, FI mitigating condition (MC) 8.c. (contact or\ncommunication with the foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation) applies. Applicant\u2019s 31-year-history of\nliving and working in the US provides additional justification for the application of FI MC 8.c. I find\nfor Applicant under the FI guideline.\nCriminal Conduct (CC). Behavior that results in a violation of the criminal law constitutes\nconduct cognizable under this guideline. Applicant committed criminal conduct in 1990, 1991 and\n1992. In December 1990, he struck his wife and daughter during an argument. In November 2001,\nhe struck his wife again during a quarrel. Even after attending 12 weeks of anger management where\nhe learned how to control his temper, he committed similar conduct in June 1992, when he hit an\nundercover police officer. Applicant\u2019s crimes fall within CC DC 30.c. (allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted) Though Applicant committed a similar offense less than eight months after striking his\nwife in November 2001, the passage of at least 15 years since the 1992 offense without criminal or\nirresponsible behavior, I conclude Applicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under the CC\nguideline. \nPersonal Conduct (PC) A security clearance aspirant has a duty to be honest during all phases\nof the security investigation. That includes furnishing forthright information when filling out the\nSCA, when providing a statement, or when supplying some other requested information. Applicant\ndid not provide honest answers when he filled out the security form in November 2004.His responses\n\n7\nto subparagraphs 3.a. and 3.c. fall within PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility) He provided two\nexplanations for not answering question 21 (subparagraph 3.a.) honestly. The only explanation that\nI give the most credence to is his typed answer (that his daughter helped to complete) to subparagraph\n2.b when he admitted he had been charged with a felony and also admitted he did not disclose the\nfelony charge because the offense was dropped. His admission that the charge was a felony raises a\nreasonable inference he knew he had been charged with a felony at the time he filled out the SCA in\nNovember 2004. I find against Applicant under subparagraph 3.a. of the SOR.\nSubparagraph 3.b. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor as Applicant\u2019s most recent offense is outside\nthe time-window of the question. \nSubparagraph 3.c. is found against Applicant. In November 2004, when furnished a response\nto question 26 of his SCA, he testified that he knew he had debts over 180 days delinquent. Though\nGE 4 and AE 1 indicate that the creditor in subparagraph 3.c.(6) was resolved through settlement,\nApplicant provided no documents to support his claims that any of the other creditors have been paid\nor settled at the time he completed the SCA. Subparagraphs 3.a., 3.c., and the personal conduct\nguideline are found against Applicant. \nThe PC guideline contains two mitigating conditions that could potentially remove the security\nconcerns caused by Applicant\u2019s dishonesty. PC MC 17.a. (the individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission, before being confronted with the facts) is not applicable because\nApplicant still denies he deliberately falsified question 21 about being charged with a felony.\nAlthough Applicant acknowledged some of the debts were over 180 days delinquent when he\ncompleted his SCA, he has provided insufficient evidence in mitigation to entertain the notion that\nhis dishonesty will not recur. PC MC 17.d. (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and\nobtained counseling to change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) is not applicable. In sum, though Applicant\u2019s\nstatements from two military officials provided positive weight in mitigating the criminal conduct,\nthe character evidence does not adequately mitigate his deliberate omission of relevant and material\ninformation from his SCA. Subparagraphs 3.a. and 3.c. are found against Applicant. \nIn reaching my findings under the specific guidelines, I have also considered those findings\nin the context of the whole person model. Applicant knew he had debts over 180 days delinquent, yet,\nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d because he did not think the debts were important. The poor judgment Applicant\ndisplayed in providing false information about his criminal record and his financial problems on his\nsecurity form has not been adequately mitigated under the PC guideline. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1. a.\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J):\nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 3.c.\nAgainst the Applicant.\n3.c.(1) through3.c.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On February 25, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the\n\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On June 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T.\nWilliams granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s application\nof the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions is unsupported by the record evidence and is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law because the whole-person considerations relied upon are unsupported\nby the record evidence.\nWhether the Record Evidence Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following relevant findings of fact.:\nApplicant was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and came to the United States\nfor further graduate-level education in 1986.  He became an American citizen in 2002.  He is single\nand has never married.  His parents and two brothers are citizens and residents of the PRC.  His\nparents are retired textile engineers.  Between 2002 and 2005, Applicant sent his parents $17,500.\nApplicant speaks to his mother five to six times a year.  One brother is a high school principal and\nteacher, and the other is an electrical engineer at a broadcasting company.  Applicant speaks to one\nbrother four or five times a year, and the other about twice a year.  Applicant traveled to the PRC in\n1995, 2003, and 2006.  The 2006 trip was for his mother\u2019s 70  birthday.  Applicant has had casual\nth\ncontact with  Chinese Embassy employees and professors visiting the United States from the PRC.\n\u201cThe PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to\nthe U.S. . . .  It has an active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. intelligence and\neconomic information, and operates against its citizens in the U.S.  However, under PRC law,\ncitizens who become naturalized citizens of other countries lose their PRC citizenship.\u201d  Decision\nat 5.\nB. Discussion\nThe appeal involves the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security\nclearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review\nunder this standard is narrow, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Judge.  We\nreview matters of law  de novo.\n\n3\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s application of the Foreign Influence\nMitigating Conditions is unsupported by the record evidence and is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  \nIt is undisputed that Applicant\u2019s father, mother, and two brothers are citizens and residents\nof the PRC.  Thus, a prima facie case under Guideline B had been established, and the burden had\nshifted to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised.  \nThe validity of Appeal Board precedent issued under earlier editions of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines is an issue in this case.  The Board has previously held \u201c. . . a Judge cannot rely on\nlanguage from an earlier version of the Directive to justify the Judge\u2019s decision and that an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility must be adjudicated under current DoD policies and standards, not\npast ones. Similarly, the precedential value of Board decisions is affected to the extent those\ndecisions involve the interpretation of a provision of the Directive that is later revised or changed.\nStatements made by the Board in earlier decisions that are predicated on then-existing language in\nthe Directive cannot be simply assumed \u2014by a Judge or a party\u2014 to be applicable in later cases after\nthe pertinent provision(s) of the Directive have been revised or changed.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-\n17369 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2006); and ISCR Case No. 02-24254 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jun. 29,\n2004) (footnotes omitted).  Of course, some precedent remains completely valid in the face of\nchanges to the guidelines, because it is not dependent on the language of any specific guideline.\nOther precedent remains valid where the applicable language of the guideline is unchanged or the\nchanges are not of sufficient magnitude to vitiate or overrule the substance of the precedent.\nHowever, Board decisions cannot be relied on or followed to the extent they involve precedent\npredicated on law or DoD policy that changed after the issuance of those decisions.  Quasi-judicial\nadjudications must be made within the bounds of applicable law and agency policy, not without\nregard to them. See, e.g., Croplife America v. Environmental Protection Agency, 329 F.3d 876, 882\n(D.C. Cir. 2003) (administrative law judges cannot ignore agency policy in making rulings); Nash\nv. Bowen, 869 F.2d 675, 680 (2d Cir. 1989)(administrative law judge is subordinate to head of\nagency or department in matters of policy); Mullen v. Bowen, 800 F.2d 535, 540 n. 5 (6th Cir. 1986)\n(decisional independence does not relieve administrative law judge of the obligation to apply agency\npolicy).  See  ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at  3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)(security clearance decisions\nmust be based on current DoD policy and standards). Accordingly, no Board decision should be\nconstrued or interpreted without regard to the law and DoD policy applicable at the time the Board\ndecision was issued.\nHere, Guideline B is at issue.  Guideline B was subject to extensive revisions in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  However, those prior Board decisions which are consistent with the\nrevised guidelines are still applicable.  For example, the new guidelines specify in paragraphs 6 and\n8(a) that the country matters.  It follows that prior Board precedent which states that when the foreign\ncountry involved is hostile to the United States, an applicant bears a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d to show\nthat neither he nor his family members in that country are subject to influence by that country is still\nvalid under the new guidelines.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 8 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).\nHere, the Judge concluded that the case was mitigated under Foreign Influence Mitigating\nConditions 8(a) and (b); without citing it, she also applied Mitigating Condition 8(c).  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions as to mitigation are unsupported by the record evidence.  \n\nTranscript at 34-35.\n1\n4\n \nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines Mitigating Condition 8(a) specifically lists the country\ninvolved as a factor to be considered as it relates to mitigation.  Here, the record evidence includes\ninformation on the nature of the PRC, but the Judge failed to take that information into consideration\nin a meaningful way in her decision.  Although a Judge is not required to discuss every piece of\nevidence, he or she cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record evidence that a\nreasonable person could expect to be taken into account.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19479 at 6\n(App. Bd. Jun. 22, 2004).  In the past, the Board has found harmful error when a Judge has failed\nto discuss the nature of the foreign government involved in a Guideline B case when that government\nis hostile to the United States and the hostility is a critical factor in the analysis of the case.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-00318 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004).  Such precedent is still valid under the new\nguidelines\u2019 specific references to the country.  \nAs Department Counsel points out, the Judge based her decision in part on her conclusion\nthat Applicant is no longer a target for espionage by the PRC because he has lost his Chinese\ncitizenship and is now an American citizen.  That conclusion is  unsupported by the record evidence.\nWhile the Judge mentioned the PRC\u2019s use of Chinese citizens within the United States as espionage\nagents, record evidence indicates that its use of espionage agents in the United States is not limited\nto Chinese citizens.  (See Report of the Select Committee on U.S. National Committee and\nMilitary/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China at 21.)  Furthermore, in light\nof record evidence concerning Chinese espionage, Applicant\u2019s contact with visiting Chinese\nscientists and professors is a significant security concern to be taken into account.          \nApplicant testified that he does not have a close relationship with his family members in the\nPRC.  The Judge based her conclusion of mitigation in part on that testimony.  However, the record\ncontains testimony and other evidence of Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his family.  There is\nevidence that:  Applicant sent $17,500 to his parents between 2002 and 2005; Applicant traveled to\nthe PRC and visited his family on three occasions; and one of those trips was for his mother\u2019s 70th\nbirthday celebration.  There is evidence that Applicant calls his mother about six or seven times a\nyear, and his older brother four or five times a year.   Given the record evidence regarding\n1\nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with his family and the PRC\u2019s human rights record, the Judge\u2019s\nstatement that \u201c[t]he fact that his parents are citizens and residents of PRC does not constitute an\nunacceptable security risk\u201d is  arbitrary and capricious.   \nIn her decision, the Judge relied on Applicant\u2019s testimony that his ties are with the United\nStates and that he would not compromise U.S. security interests.  That testimony was record\nevidence for the Judge to consider, but it is of limited significance.  An applicant\u2019s stated intention\nof what he might do in the future in a hypothetical situation is merely a statement of intention that\nis entitled to limited weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar\nmanner in the past in comparable circumstances.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09053 at 5 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2006).  \nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law because the whole-person considerations relied upon are unsupported\nby the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention has merit.  The Judge\u2019s whole-person\nanalysis is largely a restatement of her discussion under mitigation.  As discussed above, the Judge\u2019s\n\n5\nconclusions regarding mitigation are not supported by the record evidence.  To the extent that there\nis some evidence indicative of mitigation, the Judge does not explain why it outweighs the\nsignificant security concerns raised in the case.  See, e.g., 04-12435 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2007).\nMoreover, the Judge\u2019s decision does not sufficiently address the nature of the Chinese government.\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable in that it fails\nto consider an important aspect of the case, fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its\nconclusions, and offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 04-02511 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007) (citing Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of\nthe United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

On\n1\nFebruary 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant a security\nclearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)  to Applicant, detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised AG  was provided to Applicant when the SOR\nwas issued. \nIn a sworn, written statement, dated March 9, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 5, 2007. A Notice of\nHearing was issued on April 11, 2007, scheduling the hearing for April 25, 2007. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered one exhibit, Ex. 1. Applicant\noffered four exhibits, Exs. A-D. All exhibits were admitted into the record without objections. Prior\nto the hearing, the Government submitted seven documents about PRC for administrative notice. At\nthe hearing, these documents were not objected to and they were admitted into the record and marked\nas Exs. I-VII. The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a and 1.d. Those admissions\nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.b\nand 1.c. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 45 years old and has worked as a software engineer for a defense contractor\nsince 2001. He was born in PRC and graduated from a PRC university with a bachelor\u2019s and a\nmaster\u2019s degree in science. He immigrated to the U.S. in 1986 on a teaching certificate offered by\na well-known university. He graduated with a second master\u2019s degree in science in 1988. He became\na naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2002. He is single and has never married.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of PRC, living in the countryside.3\nHis parents are in their 70s and are retired textile engineers.  He sends his \u201cparents money to help\n4\n\nTr. 32.\n5\nEx.

He did not send them money in 2006. He does not\nanticipate sending them money in 2007.  He stated that: \u201c[t]hey use most of the money I send them\n6\nto improve or fix the old house they bought when they moved there. And I don\u2019t have any plan to\nhave any financial investments in China.\u201d  He talks to his mother by telephone about five to six\n7\ntimes a year.  He rarely talks to his father.\n8\n9\nApplicant stated that his relationship with his parents is not close.  His grandparents raised\n10\nhim until he was eight and recounted:\n. . . when I joined my parents and the brothers, almost 1,000 miles away. Both of my\nparents were abusive. Beating and scolding their children were commonplace, and\noften for no reason. I dreaded weekends, since they would be home all day. It felt like\nwalking on eggshells every day. The sad thing about this is they didn\u2019t even realize\nthey were abusing their children.11\nUpon graduating from high school at age 14, he left his family and never lived with them\nagain except for visits during school breaks from college and some holidays.  The PRC policy at\n12\nthe time was \u201cany high school graduate must go to countryside to live and work as a farmer if he or\nshe is not the only child in the family.\u201d  He lived in the countryside for a year and nine months.\n13\n14\nHe was then accepted at a PRC university at the age of 16, and received two degrees from that\nschool.15\nApplicant\u2019s two brothers are citizens and residents of PRC. His oldest brother is a principal\nand teacher at a small private high school, in one of the poorest areas of China. This brother is\n\nTr. 25.\n16\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, dated, March 9, 2007.\n17\nTr. 35.\n18\nTr. 28.\n19\nApplicant\u2019s Answer, note 16, supra.\n20\nTr. 30.\n21\nTr. 40-41.\n22\nTr. 42-44.\n23\n5\ndivorced and has a son.  His younger brother is an electrical engineer at a broadcasting company.\n16\nHe is also married and has a son.  He talks to his older brother about four or five times a year. He\n17\ntalks to his younger brother about twice a year.  He stated:\n18\nMy relationship with my two brothers is also more biological then [sic] by affection\nor bond. Since I came to the States, I had virtually no contact with both of my\nbrothers prior to 2003, except during my visit to China in 1995.19\nSince Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1986, he has visited China only three times in\nmore than 20 years. He has not had any contact with the Chinese government officials during any\nof his visits.  He first visited PRC in April 1995. His second visit was in September 2003. His last\n20\nvisit to PRC was in April 2006. Applicant traveled to China in April 2006 for his mother\u2019s 70th\nbirthday celebration. He has no plans to visit China in 2007. According to local custom, he stated\nthat his mother\u2019s 70th birthday was celebrated in 2006, one year prior to her actual 70th birthday.\nHis father\u2019s 70th birthday was celebrated in 2004, two years prior to his actual 70th birthday. He\nstated:\nMy activities during my visits to China were mostly just visiting family and old\nfriends and eating good food with them. I never discussed the specifics of my job\nwith anyone during my trips to China. And I never took any work related materials\nwhen I visited China.  \n21\nApplicant had casual contact with Chinese Embassy representatives in about April 2000\nwhile attending a luncheon. He also went to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., in about\nOctober 1999 with the president of a PRC university, his former professor, and with three other\nChinese professors.\nApplicant submitted four character witnesses at the hearing. The first witness is a retired\nArmy Lieutenant Colonel. As a civilian, he has worked with Applicant for the past two years.  He\n22\nbelieves Applicant is honest and a valuable asset to the projects they work on at work.

The third witness is a dance instructor at a well-known\n26\nuniversity as well as at a privately owned studio.  He has known Applicant for 12 years and they are\n27\nroommates.  He believes Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and dependable.  The fourth witness is\n28\n29\na software programmer and he met Applicant at work in 2001. They socialize at work at lunchtime\nand have gone to games and other social events with other coworkers outside of work.  This witness\n30\ntoo believes that Applicant is honest, trustworthy, and dependable.31\nTwo colleagues provided affidavits attesting to Applicant\u2019s integrity, loyalty, and\nprofessionalism. They both recommend him for a security clearance.  Another colleague, the first\n32\nwitness to testify, also provided a written endorsement for Applicant being granted a security\nclearance.33\nApplicant has strong ties to the U.S. He owns a house with his best friend.  He has a\n34\nretirement plan, and other bank accounts. He has developed close relationships through the years\nwith friends at work. He has a career that he excels in and really enjoys.35\nThe PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to the\nU.S. It has cooperated with the U.S. in the global war on terrorism in recent years. It has an active,\neffective intelligence service that targets U.S. intelligence and economic information, and operates\nagainst its citizens in the U.S. However, under PRC law, citizens who become naturalized citizens\nof other countries lose their PRC citizenship.\nPOLICIES\n\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at 2.\n36\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n37\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Included in the guidelines are disqualifying\nconditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally,\neach security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed\nin the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the\nmotivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary,\nor undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and\n(6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although\nthe presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome\ndeterminative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured\nagainst this policy guidance.\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The Government\n36\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n37\npreponderance of evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n38\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.39\nAdditionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision.40\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n41\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n42\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security\n43\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication\n44\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nUnder Guideline B, a security risk may exist for an individual with divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests. The person may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or a government in a way that is not in the interests of the U.S., or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nApplicant\u2019s parents and his two brothers are citizens and residents in PRC. PRC is a country\nthat exploits its citizens and engages in espionage. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s relatives living in PRC pose\na potential security threat and are in a position likely to create a heightened risk of exploitation by the\nPRC government. Consequently, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of\nor resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies.\nVarious factors can mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. The fact that his parents\nare citizens and residents of PRC does not constitute an unacceptable security risk. Applicant visits\nhis parents to support them with his love and respect during their advancement as senior citizens.\nAlthough they are his biological parents, he was raised by his grandmother, who is now deceased. He\ndoes not have a lot of love and affection for his parents. For the past 20 years, Applicant has developed\nstrong ties to the U.S., which include real estate ownership, bank and retirement accounts. Applicant\nhas a profession here that he is extremely proud of and that he excels in. Once Applicant became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, he lost his PRC citizenship. Thus, it is unlikely that Applicant would be\nsought out as a spy for PRC while he resides in the U.S. or visits PRC. Moreover, in the unlikely event\nthat Applicant is approached by PRC while he is in the U.S., he is aware of the protocol in place to\nreport such a transgression. It is highly unlikely that Applicant would jeopardize his relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S. in any way. Applicant can be trusted to resolve any conflict of interest with\nrelatives in PRC in favor of the U.S. Thus, Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a)\n(the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located,\nor the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) and FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest) apply. Accordingly, allegations 1.a through 1.d of the SOR are concluded in favor\nof Applicant.\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case in\nlight of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor or the national\nsecurity. Applicant presents a highly credible case that he would not be influenced by anything\n\n8\ncontrary to the best interests of the U.S. He is biologically related to his parents, but he does not have\na lot of love and affection for them and theirs is not a close familial relationship. He was raised by his\ngrandparents. He has infrequent contact with his sibling. His residence in the U.S. for more than 20\nyears and his career record as a trusted employee, refute the risk that he would take any action that\nwould jeopardize U.S. security interests. He has assimilated into U.S. customs and culture, and has\nbecome a model employee of a major defense contractor. Applicant can be trusted to resolve any\nconflict of interest with relatives in PRC in favor of the U.S. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\npotential security concerns arising from his personal ties to PRC. I find that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 2. Guideline B (Foreign Influence):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On\nSeptember 6, 2007, after reviewing the record, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1\nDepartment Counsel argues that the judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating\nConditions (FIMC) 8(a)  and 8(b)  and by her failure to discuss the dangerous conditions in\n2\n3\nAfghanistan in her whole-person analysis.   \nThe Judge found that Applicant has two children who are American citizens by birth.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and one brother are American citizens residing in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s sister is\na citizen of and resides in Canada.  Applicant has two brothers who are citizens of and reside in\nAfghanistan.  Applicant maintains regular phone contact with those two brothers, who are auto parts\nsalesmen.  The Judge recognized the security significance of the presence of the two brothers in\nAfghanistan, but concluded that the concern was mitigated under FIMC 8(a).  The Judge stated that\nthe brothers have no ties to the Afghan government or to any non-governmental organization hostile\nto U.S. interests in Afghanistan, and when Applicant was in Afghanistan as a translator, the brothers\nhelped recruit employees for the U.S. military.  Decision at 8.\nWith regard to FIMC 8(b), Applicant stated that he was loyal to the U.S. and would do\nnothing to compromise U.S. interests.  Generally, an Applicant\u2019s statements, by themselves, as to\nwhat he would  do in the face of threats by a foreign government or entity are entitled to little weight.\nOn the other hand, an applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the U.S. is very important\nand can lead to a favorable result for an applicant in a Guideline B case.  See, e.g.,ISCR Case 04-\n02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007).  In this case, Applicant has served the U.S. military as a\ntranslator in dangerous circumstances in Afghanistan and has risked his life to protect American\npersonnel there.\nIn her whole-person analysis, the Judge set out Applicant\u2019s ties to the U.S.  Applicant has\nlived in the U.S. for more than 20 years and returned to Afghanistan only once, when necessitated\nby his job as a translator for the U.S. Army.  Although he is separated from his wife, he maintains\na close relationship with his children, who are U.S. citizens by birth.  His mother lives in the U.S.\n\n3\nThe Judge acknowledged the dangerous conditions in Afghanistan.  However, she pointed\nout that the Afghan government is moving forward with democracy and developing a  rule of law,\nwith the assistance of the U.S.  There were no findings that the government of Afghanistan possesses\nan aggressive or hostile intelligence/security profile vis-a-vis the U.S., or is otherwise engaged in \nefforts to acquire classified or sensitive economic information from the U.S.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2006).  \nThe Judge emphasized the contribution Applicant has made in the War on Terrorism in\nAfghanistan.  The record contains letters of recommendation from three Americans who have served\nin Afghanistan with Applicant.  All attest to his integrity and his invaluable contribution to the\nAmerican mission there.  Applicant has served as a translator and as a cultural liaison between\nAmericans and Afghan citizens, diffusing tensions and facilitating transactions between the two\ngroups.  Applicant participated in interrogations of the Anti-Coalition Militia (ACM) and gathered\ninformation from ACM detainees which developed a greater understanding of ACM activities to\nfurther support U.S. operations.  Applicant put his life in danger on at least one occasion to protect\nAmerican lives and interests in Afghanistan.  \nAccordingly, in this case, the Judge has articulated a detailed, rational explanation for her\nfavorable determination under the whole-person concept.  The Board need not agree with the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis to conclude that it is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance is AFFIRMED.     \n        \nSigned: Michael Y.

HENRY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\n\n2\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born and raised in Afghanistan. In 1985, at the age of 18, he left Afghanistan\nwith his mother and one brother. They immigrated to the United States in 1986. All three are now\ncitizens of the United States, as are his two children. Two brothers are citizens of and reside in\nAfghanistan. His sister is a citizen of and resides in Canada. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his\nbrothers in Afghanistan does not create a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement manipulation,\npressure, or coercion. He did not intentionally falsity his security clearance application, and he has\ndemonstrated rehabilitation of his criminal conduct. He has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nregarding foreign influence, and his past criminal conduct. The government did not establish its case\nunder Guideline E, personal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 8, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.\nDOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On March 19, 2007, Applicant submitted\na notarized response to the allegations. He elected to have his case decided on the written record in\nlieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant\nwith a complete copy on June 20, 2007. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did submit a brief\nresponse, updating information on the people who know him well. DOHA assigned the case to me\non August 13, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nIn its submission of relevant material, the government included a Motion to Amend the\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to add the following allegation:\n2.b\n\u201cThat information as set forth in subparagraph 3.a. below, which is a\nfelony violation of federal law 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\u201d\nApplicant has not filed a response to the motion. The government\u2019s motion is granted and\nthe SOR is amended to include the additional allegation.\n\nItem 3, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, dated March 19, 2007, at 1.\n1\nId.\n2\nBecause he is not a lawyer and English is his second language, Applicant has not demonstrated a complete\n3\nunderstanding of the full impact of the government\u2019s motion to amend the SOR. He failed to discern the legal impact\nof the motion, but did file a response. For purposes of my decision, I deem his response to be a denial of the allegation.\nSince his mother lives in the U.S. and is a U.S. citizen, I assume that the U.S. accepted her as a refugee.\n4\nItem 4 (Applicant\u2019s Security Clearance Application, dated March 12, 2004); Item 7 (CI Screening\n5\nQuestionnaire-Middle East) at 11.\nItem 4, supra note 5, at 5, 6; Item 7, supra note 5, at 5.\n6\nItem 5 (Applicant\u2019s Security Application (SF-86), dated January 18, 2007) at 3, 12. A contractor seeks to again\n7\ndeploy Applicant as an interpreter and cultural advisor.\n3\nThe government has requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts concerning\nAfghanistan. In support of its request, it submitted Items I through VIII.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline B, subparagraph 1.b and Guideline J,\nsubparagraph 2.a of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. He denied the\n1\nremaining two allegations in the original SOR.  In his response to the FORM, he did not admit or\n2\ndeny allegation 2.b., which is deemed denied.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record\n3\nand upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant was born in Afghanistan 40 years ago. In 1985, at age 18, he left Afghanistan with\nhis mother and a brother to avoid military service. They emigrated to Pakistan. In 1986, the United\nStates (U.S.) accepted him as a refugee.  He became a U.S. citizen in 1992 and holds an active U.S.\n4\npassport.5\nApplicant has two children, ages 12 and 11, who were born in the U. S., are citizens of the\nU.S., and reside in the U.S. His father is deceased. His mother and one brother are citizens of and\nreside in the U.S. His sister is a citizen of and resides in Canada. Two brothers are citizens of and\nreside in Afghanistan, where they work in auto part sales. He speaks with them monthly and has\nstated that their lives are much better now. These two brothers do not work for the Afghanistan\ngovernment. He married in 2001. He and his wife are legally separated, but not divorced.  \n6\nSince arriving in the U.S., Applicant has worked as a baker in the donut industry, except for\napproximately 14 months, when he worked as a linguist for Department of Defense contractors.  A\n7\ncontractor hired him in 2003, then in September 2003, deployed him to Afghanistan to work as an\ninterpreter for the U.S. Army. His Army colleagues and supervisors describe him as a person with\nexceptional courage and judgment, a team member and highly trusted interpreter. He not only\ninterpreted the words spoken for two major Afghanistan dialects and other dialects, he also explained\nand assessed the cultural context of a conversation and the underlying meaning. He became the\n\nResponse, supra note 1, at 5-11; Item 7, supra note 5, at 1.\n8\nItem 7, supra note 5, at 13, 18.\n9\nItem 8 (Arrest report, dated August 6, 2002); Item 9 (Court records on plea, dated February 7, 2003);\n10\nResponse, supra note 1, at 4.\nItem 7, supra note 5, at 1-2, 6; Item 10 (Applicant\u2019s signed statement, dated February 16, 2004) at 1-2. The\n11\nfirst page of Item 7 indicates a date of January 10, 2004 and the remaining pages show a January 10, 2005 date.\nApplicant states that he was interviewed in January 2004. He signed a statement on February 16, 2004 as a result of the\ninterview. Given Applicant\u2019s statement, I find that a government investigator interviewed him in January 2004 and the\nquestionnaire was electronically completed by the investigator on January 10, 2005.\n4\ncultural advisor for their unit and effectively screened out problems. He reported a complaint by an\nAfghan local against him, which in their opinion is a reflection of his integrity. He placed himself\nin a position of potential harm on at least one occasion and in another situation, provided highly\nvaluable support to team members in a dangerous situation. His Army colleagues and supervisors\ngive him high praise for the work he did, and uniformly comment that the mission and their tasks\nwould have been much more difficult without him. Each and everyone would serve with him again.\nWhile at this outpost, Applicant, his two brothers, and a cousin recruited 110 locals to help with base\nsecurity. He accepted this position because he wanted to help the U.S. and make Afghanistan safer.8\nIn the last seven years, he traveled to Romania through London, UK, to Germany through\nAmsterdam, and to Afghanistan for work in 2003. His only other travel has been to Canada to visit\nhis sister. From the evidence of record, his trip to Afghanistan in 2003 was his first since leaving\nAfghanistan at age 18. The record contains no evidence as to the travels of his family members living\nin the U.S.9\nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s wife alleged that he beat her during a domestic dispute, which he denies.\nThe police arrested him and charged him with simple assault, a misdemeanor under state law. Based\non the advice of counsel, he pled nolo contendere to the charge. The court sentenced him to 80 hours\nof community service; fined him $200; directed him to attend a victim impact panel meeting and\nsuccessfully complete a batterer\u2019s intervention prevention program; directed he stay away from his\nwife; and placed him on 18 months of probation. He complied with the conditions of his plea. The\ncourt set aside the guilty finding and dismissed his case on October 7, 2004.10\nIn January 2004, Applicant met with an investigator while in Afghanistan. As a result of this\ninterview, the investigator completed a CI Screening Questionnaire. In his responses to the\nquestionnaire, Applicant denied any political activity, terrorist involvement, or other assistance from\nthe Afghanistan government or others in Afghanistan. He has no financial interests or property  in\nAfghanistan. He provided other information to the investigator, which was reduced to a written\nstatement dated February 14, 2004. In his signed and sworn statement, Applicant admitted to taking\none puff of a marijuana cigarette when walking with his cousin in the spring of 2002. He stated it\nwas a stupid thing to do. He denies any smoking or other use of marijuana since this time. He denies\nthe use of any other illegal drugs and stated that he did not intend to smoke marijuana again or use\nany other illegal drug in the future.11\n\nItem 3, supra note 1, at 3.\n12\nItem I (U.S. Department of State, Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, May 2007, Background Note:\n13\nAfghanistan); Item II (U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Consular Information Sheet, Afghanistan,\nSeptember 15, 2006); Item III (U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Afghanistan, June 18 2007); Item\nIV (U.S. Department of State, Afghanistan, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 2006,dated March 6, 2007);\nItem V (U.S. Department of State, Afghanistan, Country Reports on Terrorism, April 30, 2007, Chapter 2); Item VI\n(Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence, January 11, 2007); Item VII (U.S. Department of\nState, Country Reports on Terrorism, April 30, 2007, Chapter 5);(U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on\nTerrorism, April 30, 2007, Chapter 5 Southeast Asia Overview). \n5\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application on March 12, 2004 and again\non January 18, 2007, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question about illegal use of a controlled substance.\nIn his response, he denies any intent to falsify his answer. He stated he made a mistake when\ncompleting his application.12\nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts from the U.S. Department of\nState reports submitted by the government. Afghanistan is an Islamic Republic and emerging\ndemocracy. With the support of the U. S. and other nations, its new government endeavors to build\na new system of government and to rebuild the country\u2019s infrastructure. Its Army and police force\nare well trained. It continues to face significant challenges from the insurgency and terrorist\norganizations supported by the ousted Taliban and Al Qa\u2019ida. The government is not complacent\nabout the terrorist threat or the insurgency; rather it actively seeks to eliminate both with the\nassistance of the U.S. and NATO. The new government is working to reverse a long legacy of\nserious human rights abuses, but serious problems remain. Afghanistan is now an active member of\nthe international community and has signed a \u201cGood Neighbor\u201d declaration with six nations\nbordering it and promotes regional cooperation. The U.S. supports the emergence of a broad-based\ngovernment in Afghanistan. In May, the leaders of both countries concluded a strategic partnership\nagreement committing to a long-term relationship between both countries. Afghanistan continues\nto seek U.S. support as it moves forward towards democracy and stability. None of the documents\noffered in support of the request for administrative notice indicate whether Afghanistan is an active\ncollector of intelligence information.13\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not\nview the revised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging\nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge\nin reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each\nsecurity clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\n\nDirective, revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\n14\nISCR Case No. 96-0277 at 2 (App. Bd., July 11, 1997).\n15\nISCR Case No. 97-0016 at 3 (App. Bd., Dec. 31, 1997); Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n16\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The government\n15\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n16\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n17\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n18\nclearance decision.19\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n20\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n21\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n22\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n23\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nForeign Influence\n\n7\nUnder Guideline B, foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, or may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. (AG \u00b6 6.) DC \u00b6 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; DC \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information; and DC \u00b6 7(d) sharing living quarters with a\nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if the relationship creates a heightened risk of\nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion may apply. Applicant has regular contact\nwith his two brothers who still live in Afghanistan. His mother lives with him. Although the record\ndoes not reflect whether his mother has contact with family members living in Afghanistan,\ncommonsense dictates that if he contacts his brothers, most likely his mother has similar contacts.\nWhen he returned to Afghanistan as an interpreter, Applicant contacted his brothers, who also helped\nhim recruit locals for work with the Army, not to support those who may have interests contrary to\nthe U.S. or who seek to harm the U.S. The work provided much needed income and money for the\nlocals and helped protect the interests of the U.S. Thus, DC 7 \u00b6 7(b) is not applicable because no\nconflict of interest exists.\nIn deciding whether DC \u00b6 7(a) and (d) may apply, I must determine if Applicant\u2019s contacts\nwith his two brothers in Afghanistan create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure or coercion. His brothers work in auto part sales, a type of job which would\nnot bring them into regular contact with person\u2019s whose interests are adverse to the U.S. or with\nother governments. The U.S. and Afghanistan governments have a good and positive working\nrelationship. They are vigorously working together to establish democratic principles and a stable\ngovernment in this emerging democracy. Applicant does not provide financial support to his\nbrothers. Outside of his trip to Afghanistan as part of his employment, he has not traveled to his\nhomeland since leaving in 1985. His mother lives with him in the United States. Although the\nfrequency and nature of her contacts with family members in Afghanistan is unknown, the above\nfacts also apply to her.\nHis work as an interpreter supported the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan, not the work\nof those who seek to destroy the growing democracy in this country. The new Afghanistan\ngovernment relies upon the U.S. for support, both financially and militarily, as it moves forward with\nits new form of government. While Afghanistan\u2019s human rights record under the Taliban was very\ndismal and serious problems continue, its human rights record is slowly improving under the new\ngovernment. Since helping him recruit Afghan locals to work with the Army three years ago, neither\nApplicant nor his brothers have been pressured by any organization to provide any type of\ninformation, classified or otherwise, about the U.S. \nIn every case where a sibling lives overseas, there is a risk of pressure on this relative and\nthrough them upon the holder of a security clearance. Under the facts of this case, a heightened risk\nfor exploitation, inducement, manipulation pressure, or coercion is not substantial. Applicant has\nsignificant ties to the U.S. and few ties to Afghanistan. While he still has two brothers living in\nAfghanistan, his mother and two other siblings no longer live there. Two are U.S. citizens and one\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n24\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\nis a citizen of Canada. His two children are U.S. born and have resided in the U.S. at all times. He\nhas no financial or property interests in Afghanistan. He wants to help the U.S. in its role in the\nredevelopment of Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s ties with the U.S. are much stronger than his ties with\nAfghanistan. The Army holds his work as a translator in high regard. He provided more than\nlanguage interpretation skills. He explained local cultural nuances and practices which greatly\nassisted the military in accomplishing its mission. During his time in Afghanistan, he worked very\nhard to help the Army. He developed a high level of trust with the Army and the Aghan locals.\nIf a heightened risk exists because he still has two brothers in Afghanistan, he has mitigated\nany government concern under MC \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that\ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests\nof the U.S. and MC \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. His brothers sell auto\nparts and are not involved with the government of Afghanistan or any non-governmental\norganization which seeks to harm the U.S. In fact, his brothers helped him to recruit Afghan locals\nto work for the U.S. military. They have not experienced any repercussions because of these actions\nfrom any source. There is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to\nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his close ties and\nhis loyalties to the U.S., he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. (AG \u00b6 15.) Applicant\nvoluntarily admitted to one puff of marijuana in 2002 during an interview with a government\ninvestigator in January 2004, but he subsequently failed to disclose this drug use on his SF-86.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises the possible application of DC \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities. Applicant denies that he falsified his answer to the questions about his use\nof illegal drugs in the last seven years. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the\ngovernment has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish\nor prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge\nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For\n24\nDC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or\nfalsification in his answer was deliberate.\n\n9\nApplicant voluntarily provided information about his one puff on a marijuana cigarette during\nan interview with a government investigator. At this point, the government knew about his one time\nuse of marijuana. Because English is his second language, his full understanding as to the\ninformation sought by the drug question in his SF-86 is not known. Throughout the investigatory\nprocess, he has provided truthful answers to all information requested of him about his finances and\nhis family overseas. The record contains no evidence which reflects an intent to hide information\nfrom the government about himself and his family. His failure to list his one time use of marijuana\nwas nothing more than a mistake exacerbated by the fact that English is his second language. The\ngovernment has failed to establish that he intentionally lied when completing his SF-86.\nCriminal Conduct\nUnder Guideline J, criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30.) In 2002, the police arrested Applicant and charged him\nwith simple assault, a misdemeanor criminal offense under state law, after his wife filed a complaint\nof domestic abuse. Even though he denies her allegation of abuse, on advice of counsel, he pled nolo\ncontendere to the charge. The application of DC \u00b6 31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted applies.\nMC \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the\npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement applies. Applicant\ncomplied with the terms of his probation, in lieu of a sentence, which included staying away from\nhis wife and attending a batterer\u2019s intervention prevention program and a victim impact program.\nBecause he complied with the terms of his probation, the court then set aside the finding of guilty\nand dismissed his case. He has not been charged with any additional violence against his wife, and\ncontinues to stay away from her. He does not live with her, although they both live in the same large\ngeographic area. This is his only arrest since arriving in the U.S. over 20 years ago. He regularly\nworks as a baker in the donut industry. His Army colleagues praise his work skills and ethics while\nworking as an interpreter and would work with him again. Because I find that he did not intentionally\nlie when he answered his SF-86, the government has not established its case under allegation 2.b.\nHe has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his criminal conduct.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests. \nIn the more than 20 years since he left Afghanistan, Applicant returned once, to work as an\ninterpreter for the U.S. Army. Because he guided the Army personal on local customs and nuances\nrelated to the spoken word and responded very well in highly dangerous situations, the Army views\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006), the Appeal Board recognized an exception to the\n25\ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases when an applicant has established by credible, independent evidence that his\ncompliance with security procedures and regulations occurs in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which\nthe applicant had made a significant contribution to the national security and can be relied upon to recognize, resist and\nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.\n10\nhim as a valuable resource in helping it achieve its mission in Afghanistan.  With his long absence\n25\nfrom Afghanistan, he has few contacts in the country outside of his two brothers, who were also\nwilling to help the Army in its mission. \nWhile danger certainly exists for all who go to Afghanistan, Applicant and his brothers are\nin no greater danger than any other individual living and working in Afghanistan. The U.S. and\nAfghanistan governments have developed a close and positive working relationship. Afghanistan\ndepends upon the U.S. and its NATO allies to help in its fight to combat the developing insurgency\nand terrorist forces on its border with Pakistan. The Afghanistan government is moving forward with\ndemocracy and developing a rule of law, with the assistance of the U.S.\nApplicant has strong ties to the U.S. His children and mother are in the U.S. For most of his\nadult life, he has worked as a baker to support his family and himself. His one arrest resulted in\nfinding of guilt by the court, which was later set aside after he complied with all the terms of his\nsentence and probation. He has not been involved in any further incidents with his wife. He lives\naway from her. He sees his children regularly despite the long distance between them. He has no ties\nto any organization which seeks to harm the U.S. or to overthrown the existing Afghanistan\ngovernment. Because the government knew about his one-time use of marijuana, he did not falsify\nhis SF-86.\nI have carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the government\u2019s\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified information. I find that there is little potential\nfor Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because two brothers live in Afghanistan and\nhis pat criminal conduct. Accordingly, I recommend that Applicant be granted a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline B :\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs a-b: \nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2-Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a: \nFor Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 3-Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a-b: \nFor Applicant\n\n11\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nMichelle Perry, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 51-year-old engineer and subject matter security officer, failed to mitigate\nallegations of security concerns arising from misuse of corporate credit card for personal use in a\ngentlemen\u2019s club in 2003 for which he was counseled, but did the same less than a year later for\nwhich he received a Level III final warning. He initially denied the misuse but later admitted that he\nwas aware of the misuse. He mitigated security concerns under criminal conduct as to two sexual\nrelated matters each over 20 years ago but not as to his sexual behavior in attending adult\nentertainment clubs which led to his financial problems, and continues to do so but less frequently.\nHe mitigated security concerns relating to financial considerations since his financial situation\nsubstantially improved over the past four years. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 22, 2007, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\n\n2\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received March 15, 2007, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to another judge on\nJuly 23, 2007, and re-assigned to me on August 21, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued August\n28, 2007 for a hearing held on September 11, 2007. The Government introduced eight exhibits and\nApplicant introduced three exhibits. All were accepted into evidence. A government investigator and\na corporate employee who had once supervised Applicant testified for the government. Applicant\nand three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. The transcript was received on September 19,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation the four SOR allegations relating to personal conduct\nsecurity concerns. He admitted the three allegations relating to sexual behavior. Before the hearing\nthe government moved on August 29, 2007 to amend the SOR to add one allegation of financial\nconsiderations security concerns based on the same allegations alleged as the personal conduct\nallegations. Applicant did not object to the amendment and the new allegation was added to the SOR\nat the hearing (Tr. 9). After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as a principal\nsystems engineer since October, 2001. He is also an information systems security officer. He holds\na B.S. degree in electrical engineering. Before his present employment he worked in a similar field\nfor another major defense contractor for four years between 1987 and 2001 when the company was\npurchased by his present employer. He has held a security clearance for 20 years. \nIn 1983 when he was 27 years old, Applicant used an outcall service for massage and sexual\nservices. The service was a front for prostitution. Four years later in 1987, Applicant plead guilty to\na charge of lewd act in a public place, his automobile in a park. He had picked up a hitchhiker who\npropositioned him and he accepted and paid for her services. He was fined $300 but no punishment.\nHe has had no similar problems in the past 20 years and testified that it would never happen again.\nIn 2003, while employed at his present employer Applicant  mis-used a corporate credit card\nissued by his employer for company business for personal use including charges to adult\nentertainment clubs. He had developed a form of addiction to the entertainment provided especially\nlap-dancing and was spending as much as $500 each night he went to the clubs. He still goes to the\n\n3\nclubs but less frequently and only spends approximately $100 per evening when he attends. He also\ngambled in casinos but the debts only once exceeded $1,000 during his occasional visits and were\nnot a major contribution to his financial problems. At the same time he was adding to his delinquent\ndebts, he was unable to pay his 2002 federal income taxes because of his financial situation. \nApplicant was counseled by his supervisor about the mis-use of the credit cards in August\n2003. In 2004 he misused the company credit card again despite the warning he had received. He\nthen was issued a Level III final warning by his supervisor for his employer on March 24, 2004. He\ninitially denied the offenses at that time blaming it on the similarity of appearance of his corporate\ncard and his personal card and various other reasons to his supervisor (Tr. 30-40). When confronted\nwith credit card statements, he acknowledged that he knew he was using the corporate card since his\nown had reached the maximum level of indebtedness (Tr. 40-41). His corporate card was canceled\nand the company denied him a merit pay increase for that year, and would not allow him to be\npromoted or transferred for 12 months. He continued to work at the company and has had no\ndifficulty since then. The supervisor who first confronted him about the violations was one of those\nin the company who recommended him for a security clearance and did so at the hearing. \nIn past years both for his present and former employer, Applicant was permitted on request\nto use the corporate card for personal matters including travel to the funeral of his father and while\non government business but using for personal purposes (Tr. 97). No request was made or\npermission was given for the personal use in 2003 and 2005 (Tr. 131). \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on April 19, 2005, where he\noutlined the conduct and said he did not realize he was using the corporate card until his supervisor\nadvised him that records indicated that he had. He detailed some of the conduct alleged as well as\nthe indebtedness that arose from that conduct. The investigator interviewed eight others in the\ninvestigation and all recommended that a security clearance be granted (Tr. 84).\nApplicant\u2019s current financial records indicates that he has no debt problems (Exhs. A, B, and\nC). He re-financed his home in 2005 and resolved all his outstanding debts. The result was a\nsubstantial increase in his net worth from 2003 to 2007 (Exh. A and Tr. 109). He also eliminated\nsome expenses so that his financial situation would be sound (Tr.105-106). He did so without the\nuse of credit counseling. His annual salary is $95,000 based on hourly wages that he receives every\ntwo weeks (Tr. 151). \nApplicant has never served in the military except for a brief period as an officer candidate\nfor the Marine Corps. He dropped out voluntarily because he decided he was not cut out to be a\nmarine. However, he took an oath to become an officer candidate and still regards himself as obliged\nto live by that oath. Since he did not serve, he regards his present work as his contribution to the\nnational defense. His work as a subject matter security expert for his company insuring compliance\nwith NISPOM and working with a large number of documents and personnel was described at the\nhearing (Tr. 119-130). \nThree corporate witnesses of Applicant\u2019s employer testified for him. One worked for him and\nApplicant served as his mentor. The second was a project leader for a program on which Applicant\nworked. The third was a colleague who worked with Applicant for many years in the security field.\nAll have held security clearances for many years. They vouched for his trustworthiness, skills, and\n\n4\ndedication, and believe he is capable of holding a security clearance. They all were aware of the\nissues that were presented at the hearing and all supported his effort to keep his security clearance\n(Tr. 155-202). \nApplicant has never been married and has no immediate family. He has no family financial\nobligations other than his own. His hobbies away from his job include home construction and repair,\nplaying pool with friends, and photography.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nSecurity clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d -----\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) are applicable to cases with an SOR dated after\nSeptember 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s conduct regarding the misuse of the corporate credit card prompted\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\neffective September 1, 2006. Such conduct might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not\n\n5\nproperly safeguard classified information (AG 15). The Government established each of the\nallegations under Guideline E Personal Conduct alleged in the SOR. The specific conditions\napplicable to this case are AG \u00b6 16 (d) 1 and 4 concerning Applicant\u2019s pattern of rule violations and\nevidence of significant misuse of an employer\u2019s time and resources through misuse of the corporate\ncredit card and his initial denial of the misuse.\nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable include AG \u00b6 17 (c) if the fact that the\noffense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or happened under such unique circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment, or under AG \u00b6 17 (d) that the individual has acknowledged his behavior and taken positive\nsteps to alleviate the factors that caused the behavior, or under AG \u00b6 17 (e) that the individual has\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress.\nWhile Applicant has resolved most of his debt problems and has made others aware of the\ncircumstances of this case, the fact that he committed the violations of company policy (Exh. 8) not\nonce but again less than a year later after having been warned and counseled with sanctions imposed\nafter the second offense leads me to the conclusion that he has not mitigated this allegation. \nUnder Guideline D of the Directive sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a\ncriminal offense, and may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG\u00b6 12).\nConditions that raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 13 (d) are if the sexual\nbehavior is of a public nature and reflects lack of discretion or judgment. Having established such\nreasons, Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence that refutes,\nmitigates, or extenuates the disqualifying conditions and demonstrates it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant a security clearance. \nMitigating conditions might include under AG \u00b6 14 (b) that the behavior was not recent and\nis unlikely to recur, or under AG \u00b6 14 (c) if the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion,\nexploitation, or duress. I conclude the allegations from 1983 and 1987 are mitigated by the passage\nof time and unlikelihood that such incidents would recur. While attending an adult club is not\ncriminal conduct, the fact that Applicant did so and continues to do so after the difficulties that have\narisen from past attendance does not speak well for his judgement and reflects on his lack of\ndiscretion and judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of the security concern under Guideline\nF because under AG \u00b6 18 an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations under AG \u00b6 19 (c), and evidence\nof inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts under AG \u00b6 19 (a). \nMitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply include under AG \u00b6 20 (c)the fact that there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. Applicant has shown that his\nfinancial situation has substantially improved since 2003 primarily through the sale of his home but\nalso by imposing financial discipline on himself. He will resolve the remaining current debts he has\nwithin 90 days of the hearing date and has no delinquent debts (Exh. C). The cited mitigating\ncondition is applicable. \n\n6\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nIn evaluating his behavior in terms of the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d(AG \u00b6 2), an applicant may\nmitigate security concerns by demonstrating the factors leading to the violation are not likely to\nrecur(\u00b6 9),), and evidence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes (\u00b6 6). The\nincidents that gave rise to this proceeding may not be likely to recur. However, the SOR allegations\nall relate to the security clearance process and his willingness to be candid in providing responses.\nThey also relate to an applicant who, in addition to his engineering responsibilities, has certain\nimportant security responsibilities about which he should have been acutely aware. His conduct\nbelied that awareness and responsibility. After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an\nintegrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude a security clearance should\nnot be granted to him. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On September 19,\n2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge was biased.\nApplicant argues that Judge was biased, essentially based upon the fact that the Judge did not\nfind Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence sufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nbiased or unfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that\nwould lead a reasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not demonstrated merely\nbecause the Judge made adverse findings or reached unfavorable conclusions.  Id.  Moreover, even\nif an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error, standing alone, does not\ndemonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudiced.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd.\nJul. 2, 2007).\nApplicant has not met the heavy burden of persuasion noted above, in that he fails to identify\nanything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable person to question\nthe fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-00740 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  She found in favor of Applicant under Guideline H\nand with respect to several of the factual allegations under Guidelines J and E.  However, she\nreasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep.\n4, 2007).  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her\ndecision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines J, Criminal Conduct, H, Drug Involvement, and E, Personal Conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 9, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 8, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on September 11, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 17, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted the allegations in SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g, and \ndenied all of the remaining allegations. His admissions, denials and explanations are \nincorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old instrumentation technician for a defense contractor. He \nhas worked for the defense contractor for almost 26 years and held a secret clearance \nfor approximately 25 years. He is a high school graduate and served in the Army for \nfour years before being honorably discharged. He is twice married and has been \nmarried to his second wife for 18 years and has two sons, 17 and 16 years old.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted in 1987 he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor \nassault on his first wife. He was arrested and charged again in October 1988 for \nmisdemeanor assault, again on his first wife. He pled guilty and was convicted of both of \nthe offenses. At his hearing he denies he did anything.1  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in January 1990 and charged with felony possession of \nmarijuana with intent to distribute. He was found guilty of misdemeanor possession of \nmarijuana and received a fine. Applicant stated he was sitting in a car with his friends \nand there was marijuana in the car. The police charged everyone in the car. Applicant \nadmitted he was in the car, but stated the drugs did not belong to him. He admitted he \nwas handcuffed and spent the night in jail. He was represented by an attorney and both \nthe court and his attorney explained to him that he was being charged with a felony and \nthat he could potentially receive up to a year in jail if found guilty of a felony. Applicant \ndid not list this felony arrest on his security clearance application (SCA).2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in October 1994 and charged with misdemeanor \npossession of marijuana and trespassing. He was found guilty of both charges and \nfined. Applicant admitted he was convicted of these offenses. He also discussed the \nfacts with the investigator when he was interviewed for his background investigation for \nhis security clearance. Applicant stated he was wearing a jacket, he gave it to his \ngirlfriend and then his girlfriend gave it back to him and it had marijuana in the pocket. \nHe had an altercation with the security guards at an apartment complex. He stated the \nsecurity guards beat him up for no reason. The police were called and Applicant was \narrested and they found the marijuana in his pocket. He admitted he went to court and \nwas advised of what he was being charged with and had a lawyer who explained the \n \n1 Tr. 35-37. \n \n2 Tr. 38-43. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ncharges to him. He was found guilty of possession of marijuana and trespassing. He \nreceived a suspended sentence. He failed to list this drug charge on his SCA.3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol \n(DUI) in August 1998. Although Applicant listed his DUI on his security clearance \napplication as occurring in 1996, it was determined that he was only arrested and \ncharged with DUI on one occasion and it was in 1998. He admitted he was pulled over \nby the police during a workers\u2019 strike against his employer. He was letting a passenger \nout of the car and apparently made an illegal stop on a highway. He took a breathalyzer \nand recorded a .10%. Applicant believed he was targeted by the police because he was \na striker, but does not deny he was drinking, driving and recorded a blood alcohol over \nthe legal limit. He was found guilty of DUI, fined and was required to attend an Alcohol \nSafety Program once a week for six months.4  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he was arrested around September 2000 and charged with \nfelony possession of a controlled substance, crack cocaine. He was represented by an \nattorney and was found guilty of the offense at trial. He was sentenced to five years of \nconfinement, which was suspended, and placed on one year of supervised probation \nand subject to random drug testing. This offense occurred after Applicant\u2019s DUI \nconviction. Applicant pled not guilty to the offense and was found guilty at trial.5  \n \n \nApplicant completed his SCA in March 2006. He does not remember ever \nproviding any other SCA except his original in 1982. He understood the importance of \naccurately completing the SCA to both the government and himself. He also understood \nthe importance of a government security clearance and that he was required to tell the \ntruth and provide completely truthful answers. It took Applicant several days to complete \nthe SCA. He filled it out at home and his answers were then transferred electronically by \na company official. He reviewed the final document before signing it. At his hearing he \nsaid he skipped around reading it, but understood he was swearing to its truthfulness \nand answered under criminal penalty.6  \n \n \nOn his SCA Applicant admitted he was convicted of a drug felony and a DUI. He \nfailed to report he had been arrested and charged with felony possession of marijuana. \nHe was later convicted of misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He failed to list he \nwas convicted of a second possession of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s explanation for failing \n \n3 Tr. 43-47. \n \n4 Tr. 47-55. It appears that the offenses alleged in SOR 1.e and 1.f are the same offense. The \nonly evidence of two offenses was provided by Applicant and it is clear that he confused the dates and \nthere is only one DUI offense. \n \n5 Tr. 56-70. It appears that the offenses alleged in 1.g and 1.h are the same offense. The only \nevidence of two offenses was provided by Applicant and it is clear that he confused the dates and there is \nonly one felony offense for crack cocaine possession. \n \n6 Tr. 73-83. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nto list his other drug offenses was because he believed he only had to go back seven \nyears.7  \n \n \nApplicant testified he has held a secret security clearance for 25 years. He was \nasked if he ever advised his employer that he had been arrested and convicted of a \nfelony for possessing crack cocaine. He admitted he never told his employer of his \nconviction. He stated he did tell his employer about his first misdemeanor conviction of \npossession of marijuana, but did not report the second arrest and conviction of \nmarijuana possession. He stated he did tell his employer about his DUI arrest and \nconviction. He admitted he did not report his criminal conduct because he was \nembarrassed.8  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and explanation for why he failed to provide accurate \nanswers in his SCA was not credible. I find he intentionally and deliberately failed to \ndivulge important and complete information about his past criminal conduct. Although I \nhave not considered for disqualifying purposes his omissions and failures to report his \ncriminal conduct to his employer while holding a secret security clearance, I have \nconsidered it when evaluating his honesty and veracity as a whole. It is clear that at the \ntime of his offenses, Applicant did not want his employer to know about them because \nhe understood that it could affect his job and security clearance.9  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has never used marijuana or cocaine. He stated he no \nlonger associates with those who use drugs. Applicant testified that he believes he is a \nhard worker, good family man, football coach and good with the military. He believes his \ncharacter is \u201cgreat.\u201d He testified that every time something happened with the police \u201cit \nwas always me.\u201d He denied he was responsible for the offenses he was convicted of. \nHe stated he appealed every conviction, but did not win any of them.10  \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters from friends and coworkers. Some of the \ncomments are provided. He is considered a good and trusted friend. He displayed a \nhigh degree of integrity, responsibility, and ambition. He is considered a leader with an \nexcellent work ethic. He is dependable and willing to assist others. He does quality work \nand is a committed team member who willingly takes on responsibility. He is considered \na loving and supportive father. Applicant is a long time coach for youth football and is a \npositive role model. He is considered a good person.11 No information was provided as \nto whether any of these people knew of Applicant\u2019s criminal convictions. \n \n \n \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Tr. 83-88, 93. \n \n9 Id. \n \n10 Tr. 92. \n \n11 AE A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the \nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, \ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other \nsimilar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\u201d \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \n(c) (\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, \nsale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d). I conclude the above \ndisqualifying condition applies. Appellant has one felony conviction for possession of \ncrack cocaine and two misdemeanor convictions for possession of marijuana. Although \nhe testified he has never used marijuana or cocaine, he clearly associated with those \nthat did, which created a heightened risk of vulnerability.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26 (a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened under \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and (b) (\u201ca demonstrated intent not to \nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (a) disassociation from drug-using associates \nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation\u201d). Applicant\u2019s was convicted of a felony for drug \npossession in 2000. He has other drug convictions that reflect a pattern of being \nassociated with drug users. He states he has never used marijuana or cocaine, but \nclearly he placed himself in situations that created risks. He stated he no longer \nassociates with drug abusers. Although Applicant\u2019s credibility was very questionable \nthroughout his hearing, the facts support that he has not had any additional drug \noffenses since 2000. I find an eight year period supports he has discontinued his \nrelationships with drug users. Therefore, I find (a) and (b) apply.  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG\u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: ACriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person=s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.@ \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 \n(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and (\u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted\u201d). I find both disqualifying conditions apply. Appellant was \narrested, charged, and convicted of misdemeanors and felonies for assaults, \npossession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of crack cocaine, \ntrespassing, and DUI.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for Criminal Conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 (a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under unusual circumstances that is it unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe person \nwas pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer \npresent in the person\u2019s life\u201d); (c) (\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\u201d); \n(d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement\u201d). Appellant was on probation for five years after his felony conviction for \npossession of crack cocaine. He denied he was responsible for all of the drug offenses \nand portrayed himself as the victim of circumstances or he was being targeted. He \ncontested the charges against him and was found guilty. He appealed all of his \nconvictions, but did not win on appeal. He failed to tell his employer about some of his \nmore serious offenses, which occurred while he was holding a security clearance. \nAlthough it has been three years since he completed his probation, it does not appear \nhe has come to grips with his criminal past. He is not remorseful, but wants to place \nblame elsewhere. He admitted he was drinking and driving and had a blood alcohol \ncontent over the legal limit, but thinks the police were out to get him. Appellant has a \nlong history of violating the law and although it appears he has not been arrested in the \npast few years, I do not find he has presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the \ncriminal conduct security concerns that were raised.   \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). Applicant only divulged his DUI and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis felony conviction for possession of crack cocaine on his SCA. He did not disclose \nhis prior felony arrest for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute or his \nmisdemeanor arrest and conviction of possession of marijuana. Appellant was well \naware of his past arrest record. He testified he had pled not guilty to the charges and \nwas found guilty. He did not divulge his felony conviction for possession of crack \ncocaine to his employer. He did divulge it on his SCA because it was obvious he could \nno longer hide it. His concealment of his crack cocaine possession goes to his credibility \nabout why he did not divulge his other offenses. I find Applicant was not believable and \nintentionally and deliberately omitted his past drug offenses.  \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under AG \n\u00b617 and specifically considered (a) (\u2018the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand dose not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); and (e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d) Applicant did not make an effort \nto promptly notify officials that he failed to divulge all of his past drug offenses. I find (a) \ndoes not apply. Applicant\u2019s offenses are serious, both the drug offenses and his failure \nto provide honest, complete and accurate information on his SCA. Because he \ndemonstrated a willingness to hide his criminal drug offenses from his employer, while \nhe held a security clearance, I can not find that his conduct is unlikely to recur. It casts \nserious doubts on his trustworthiness and good judgment. Applicant has not taken \nresponsibility for his omissions or his past drug and criminal conduct, all of which reflect \nnegatively on his personal conduct and causes security concerns.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a history of criminal \narrests, charges, and convictions for assaults, trespassing and drug possessions, both \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfelony and misdemeanor. He failed to divulge all of his past drug offenses on his SCA. \nHe seems to have moved away from associating with drug abusers, but does not take \nresponsibility for his involvement in violating the law. I have serious concerns about his \nhonesty, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant successfully mitigated \nthe security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, but he failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Guidelines E, Personal Conduct and J, Criminal Conduct.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline H: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a (1): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a (2): \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b (1): \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b (2): \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He calls his mother daily and visits\nher about once a year.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2001, but he continued to use his Russian\npassport to visit his mother.  He has destroyed his Russian passport and taken significant steps to\nrenounce his Russian citizenship.  He has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign\npreference, but he has not mitigated the concerns based on foreign influence.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 23, 2007, admitted all but one of the\nallegations, offered explanations, and elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of a\nhearing.  On June 22, 2007, he changed his election and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned\nto an administrative judge on July 11, 2007, and reassigned to me on July 25, 2007.  It was heard as\nscheduled on August 23, 2007.  I kept the record open until September 6, 2007, to enable Applicant\nto submit additional evidence.  I received his evidence on August 27, 2007.  Several documents were\nin Russian, and I requested Applicant to translate them.  I received the translations on September 5,\n2007.  Department Counsel did not object to the additional evidence (Hearing Exhibit (HX) II).  The\ndocuments have been admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) C, D, and E.  DOHA received the\ntranscript (Tr.) on September 12, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 59-year-old physics engineer for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his\ncurrent employer since December 2002.  He has never held a clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a statement on his behalf attesting to his professional\nqualities, maturity, and high level of integrity (AX B).  At the hearing, a retired military officer with\na top secret clearance, who has known Applicant since 2002 as a peer and a supervisor, described\nApplicant as \u201cextremely competent,\u201d a valued team member, and a trustworthy person (Tr. 39, 44).\nApplicant was born and educated in Russia.  He obtained a Ph.D. in March 1980 from the\nP.N. Lebedev Physical Institute, the largest and oldest research center in Russian, regarded as the\nflagship of Russian science (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at 11; GX 2).  While a student at the\nLebedev Institute, he worked as a junior research associate from February 1971 until his graduation,\nand then as a senior scientist until December 1992 (GX 1 at 28).  He worked on government\ncontracts and held a \u201clow level\u201d Russian clearance, roughly equivalent to a \u201cconfidential\u201d clearance\n(Tr. 42, 56-57).  Before attending the Institute, he worked as a junior research associate at the\nMoscow Institute of Electronics Engineering from July 1971 to January 1977 (GX 1 at 28).  \nAround 1992, Applicant concluded that Russian science was in disarray, and he came to the\nU.S. when he was invited by a U.S. university to join the faculty as a visiting scientist.  After two\n\n4\nyears he moved to another U.S. university, and he decided to stay in the U.S. because of the poor\nstate of Russian science at the time (Tr. 57-58). \nApplicant married a Russian woman in March 1977.  They have two children, born in Russia.\nHis son renounced his Russian citizenship at age 18, because he was concerned about his\nvulnerability to mandatory military service in Russia (Tr. 59).  Applicant, his wife and two children,\nnow ages 28 and 26, became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2001. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Russia.  He calls her almost every day (Tr. 68).\nHe visited her in 2000, and annually from 2002 to 2007, using his Russian passport (Tr. 65-66).  He\ntestified he used his Russian passport because Russia does not issue visas to Russian citizens who\nleft the country after February 1992, and because his use of the Russian passport enabled him to enter\nthe country without revealing anything about his work in the U.S. (Tr. 50).  \nApplicant intended to bring his 87-year-old mother to the U.S., but she was hit by a car in\n2004, and her disability made her unable to timely submit her visa application.  She also lost her\nbirth certificate and was unable to obtain a duplicate due to the inefficiency and corruption of\nRussian officials.  A friend is now helping his mother with the paperwork for her application (Tr.\n52, 70).  His mother is \u201cpractically recovered\u201d from her injuries and is willing to come to the U.S.\nand live with Applicant and his family (Tr. 69).\nApplicant\u2019s mother receives a pension and benefits from the Russian government (Tr. 63).\nDuring World War II, his mother was drafted and served in a medical unit for two years (Tr. 64). \nHis mother has never visited him in the U.S. (Tr. 65).  Neither Applicant nor any member of his\nfamily was a member of the Communist Party (Tr. 64-65).  \nApplicant does not consider himself a Russian citizen (Tr. 61).  He testified he does not like\nor trust the current Russian government (Tr. 72).  In July 2007, Applicant obtained the necessary\nforms to renounce his Russian citizenship.  At the time of the hearing, he had completed the forms\nand was awaiting documentation from the Russian Revenue Service confirming that he had no tax\nand property liability in Russia (AX C, D, and E; Tr. 60-61).\nIn August 2007, Applicant surrendered his Russian passport to his facility security officer,\nwho cut it into pieces and put the pieces in a burn barrel (AX A).  He testified he will not be able to\nvisit Russia again until he completes the process of renouncing his Russian citizenship (Tr. 66-67).\nAt the request of Department Counsel, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of relevant adjudicative facts about Russia (Tr. 24; HX II).  The government\nof the Russian Federation consists of a strong president, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature,\nand a weak judiciary.  The U.S. and Russian share common interests on a broad range of issues.  The\nU.S. and Russia are engaged in reduction of strategic arsenals, and they share a basic goal to stem\nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  They are allies in the war on terrorism.  Russia is\na participant in efforts to dismantle North Korea\u2019s nuclear program, and takes part in the Middle East\nPeace Process \u201cQuartet,\u201d along with the United Nations and the European Union.  \nOn the other hand, Russia has an active, ongoing economic collection program targeting U.S.\ntechnology.  It also has a strong intelligence organization retained from the Soviet Union, including\n\n5\nspecialized, technical intelligence activities targeting the U.S.  It has an intelligence service that\nworks outside Russia by targeting researchers involved in national security and the environment.\nIt operates a facility in Cuba targeting U.S. signal operations.  It sells technology for missiles and\nweapons of mass destruction, for money and diplomatic influence, to other counties including China,\nVenezuela, India, and Iran.  It has internal problems with terrorist activity including suicide\nbombings, assassinations, and kidnapings.  It has a poor human rights record, with problems\nincluding government corruption, media suppression, politically motivated abductions,\ndisappearances, poor prison conditions, and arbitrary arrest and detention.  Dual U.S.-Russian\ncitizens risk being viewed as Russian citizens and not allowed to leave Russia without a Russian\npassport.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\n\n6\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.a), she\ndecided to remain in Russia after Applicant had gained U.S. approval for her entry into the U.S.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b), and Applicant traveled to Russia on multiple occasions (SOR \u00b6 1.c).  It also alleges he\nworked at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow, Russian, from 1977 to 1992, before he came\nto the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  The concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and\ninterests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, a\ndisqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). Second, a disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a\nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  The evidence\nthat Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Russia raises the \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b67(a)\nand the \u201cpotential conflict of interest\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(b), shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\n\n7\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant obviously is very close to his\nmother.  His mother is dependent on the Russian government for her pension and other benefits.  The\ngovernment has a poor human rights record and actively targets the U.S. for industrial as well as\nmilitary espionage.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  Applicant is deeply committed to the U.S. and has little use\nfor the current Russian government, but he is also deeply committed to his mother and concerned\nabout her welfare.  I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of establishing AG \u00b6 8(b).  No\nother mitigating conditions are relevant to the facts of this case.\nApplicant presented uncontroverted evidence that his mother\u2019s decision to remain in Russia,\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, was the result of her injury and subsequent disability, and not due to any\nchange of heart on her part or Applicant\u2019s.  I conclude any security implications of his mother\u2019s\nfailure to follow through on the plan to move to the U.S. have been explained away, and I resolve\nSOR \u00b6 1.b in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nBecause Applicant\u2019s studies and employment at the Lebedev Physical Institute, alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d, occurred before he came to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen, and there is no evidence\nthat he has any continuing contacts with the Institute, I conclude his involvement with the Institute\nhas minimal security significance.  Although this conduct is alleged under Guideline B, the\nunderlying premise of AG \u00b6 11(c) (conduct occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen)\nunder Guideline C is relevant and is established by the evidence.  \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercised dual U.S.-Russian citizenship (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and used\nhis Russian passport after he obtained a U.S. passport (SOR \u00b6 2.b).  The concern under this guideline\nis as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that\nare harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG \u00b6 9.  A disqualifying condition may arise from\n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a\ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  Applicant\u2019s possession and use of a Russian passport after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen establishes this disqualifying condition.\n\n8\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Three mitigating conditions are relevant.  First, security\nconcerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on\nparents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(a).  Second, they also can be mitigated\nby evidence that \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n11(b).  Third, they can be mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  All three mitigating conditions are\nestablished.\nDual citizenship is not a disqualifying condition, unless it is exercised.  Thus, the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6 2.a have little security significance standing alone.  The allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b are\npremised on Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship, thus incorporating and duplicating SOR \u00b6 2.a.  When the\nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicate allegations\nshould be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at\n3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a. in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors are discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has lived in the U.S. for 15 years.  He and his family\nmembers have been U.S. citizens for six years.  He is loyal to the U.S. and has little use for the\ncurrent Russian government.  He has destroyed his Russian passport and taken significant steps to\nrenounce his Russian citizenship, even though it will make visits to his aging mother more difficult.\nNevertheless Russia\u2019s human rights record and its active intelligence activities targeting the U.S. are\nfactors that weigh heavily against granting Applicant a clearance.  If Applicant and his mother follow\nthrough with plans for her to move to the U.S., the security landscape may be significantly different\nfor Applicant.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a dual citizen of Serbia and the U.S. who actively exercised his foreign\ncitizenship by renewing and using a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport after he became a U.S.\ncitizen. He maintained his foreign citizenship in part to protect his ownership of property abroad.\nForeign preference concerns are not fully mitigated by his recent surrender of his foreign passport\nto his employer\u2019s facility security officer. His mother, a Serbian citizen, resides with him in the U.S.,\nbut Applicant remains at risk of foreign influence because of his co-ownership with her of an\napartment in Serbia and of a resort property in Montenegro, and his sole ownership of a second\nseaside apartment in Montenegro, which in the aggregate are valued at between 290,000 and 340,000\neuros. Clearance is denied.\n\nApplicant's answer is dated May 4, 2006 [sic], due likely to a typographical error.\n1\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on April 10, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (foreign preference) and\nGuideline B (foreign influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on\nMay 4, 2007.1\nOn June 25, 2007, the government notified Applicant that it was requesting a hearing in his\ncase and the case was assigned to me on August 3, 2007. I convened a hearing on October 16, 2007,\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. At the hearing, two Government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and one Applicant\nexhibit (Ex. A) were admitted. Testimony was taken from Applicant and two witnesses. DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 25, 2007.\nThe record was held open until October 30, 2007, for Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentation and for the government to amend a request for administrative notice to include\ninformation about Montenegro. By facsimile on October 22, 2007, Applicant submitted through his\nemployer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) a document confirming the FSO\u2019s receipt of Applicant\u2019s\nforeign passport. Department Counsel had no objection and I admitted the document as Exhibit B.\nThe government did not move to amend its request for administrative notice.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn July 26, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning Serbia. For source documentation the government relied on publications\nfrom the U.S. State Department: Background Note: Serbia, dated June 2007; Consular Information\nSheet-Serbia, dated February 21, 2007, and Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006-\nSerbia (Includes Kosovo), dated March 6, 2007.  Applicant filed no objections. After weighing the\nreliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and materiality of the facts\nproposed, I took administrative notice of certain facts as set forth below.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercises dual\ncitizenship with Serbia and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a); obtained his Serbian passport in July 1997\n(renewed August 26, 2000) after he had become a U.S. citizen in March 1996 and been granted his\nU.S. passport in May 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); maintains his Serbian citizenship because he owns three\napartments in Serbia valued collectively at about $350,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and used his Serbian\npassport in lieu of his U.S. passport to enter and exit Serbia in 2000, 2003, and 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\n\n3\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s mother is a dual citizen of\nSerbia and the U.S. living with him in the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.a); his two aunts are Serbian resident\ncitizens (SOR \u00b6 2.b); Applicant owns the three apartments in Serbia (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and he traveled to\nSerbia in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). Applicant admitted the allegations,\nbut indicated at his hearing that with the recent dissolution of the Serbia-Montenegro federation in\nJune 2007, it is no longer accurate to indicate that his properties are all in Serbia. Two of his\nproperties abroad are located in Montenegro and one in Serbia.\nAfter a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed\nto take administrative notice of relevant and material facts concerning Serbia, I make the following\nfactual findings.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old mechanical engineer employed by a small defense contractor since\nJuly 1997. He has served as principal investigator on more than 30 research projects and is a group\nleader of eight engineers on an autonomous intelligence program. He seeks a secret-level security\nclearance so he can participate in the implementation stage of projects.\nAn ethnic Serb, Applicant was born and raised in what was then the Socialist Republic of\nYugoslavia. His father was employed as an engineer for the federal patent bureau before his death\nin 1983, and his mother was an editor for an electric power systems journal. In December 1980,\nApplicant was awarded his diploma (equivalent to a bachelor of science degree) in mechanical\nengineering from a university in Belgrade. At the time, he was serving one year of compulsory\nmilitary service in the Yugoslav Army. He completed his obligation in about March 1981. In 1982,\nhe began working as a research and design engineer at a research and design institute affiliated with\na large manufacturing company in Belgrade. The company produced trains, coaches, and heavy\nequipment for civil engineering.\nIn September 1982, while continuing to work, Applicant began graduate studies in\nmechanical engineering at the same university in Belgrade where he had earned his undergraduate\ndiploma. On earning his master of science degree in mechanical engineering in June 1985, he was\nawarded a competitive stipend from Yugoslavia\u2019s science association to study abroad. Applicant\nelected to pursue a research fellowship at an Ivy League university in the U.S. and he came to the\nU.S. in about September 1986. He continued to receive a salary from the Belgrade company while\nconducting thesis-related research in the U.S.\nIn August 1988, Applicant married his first wife, who was a native U.S. citizen. A son was\nborn to them in May 1989. In late 1989, Applicant moved his spouse and child temporarily to\nBelgrade, as he had an obligation to his foreign employer who had made it financially possible for\nhim to pursue his research for three years in the U.S. Applicant and his spouse experienced marital\nproblems, and she returned to the U.S. with their son. They were divorced in the U.S. in August\n1991. Applicant\u2019s son lived with his mother until she died in June 2007. He visited Applicant two\nor three times monthly until he went to college in about September 2007.\nApplicant completed his obligation to his employer in Belgrade in about fall 1991. In January\n1992, he was awarded a doctorate of technical sciences degree from the Yugoslavian (now Serbian)\nuniversity. Applicant contacted the faculty member in the U.S. who had invited him to come to the\nuniversity in 1986, and he returned to the U.S. in 1992 to assume a faculty/research position at the\n\nApplicant testified he is not certain of when the two apartments in Montenegro were purchased (\u201cI think it was\n2\nin 2000, after 2000, after the year 2000, so was it 2001? 2003?\u201d). (Tr. 80)\nThere is no evidence contradicting Applicant\u2019s testimony that even before its recent independence from Serbia,\n3\nMontenegro had its own laws that allowed foreigners to own property within its territory. (Tr. 78) \n4\nuniversity. Applicant brought his mother to live with him in the U.S. in 1992. She had already retired\nfrom her job as an editor.\nIn March 1996, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, taking an oath to renounce all\nforeign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or\nperform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. His acquisition\nof U.S. citizenship did not affect his status as a citizen of Yugoslavia. Applicant was issued his U.S.\npassport in May 1996. In early January 2002, his mother became a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nApplicant left academia for his current employment in July 1997. In 1999, he met his current\nspouse who is a native U.S. citizen. In January 2002, Applicant and his current spouse were married.\nHis late father\u2019s two sisters came from Belgrade for his wedding. They stayed with Applicant and\nhis mother.\nIn late August 2000, Applicant renewed his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport for\nanother ten years. Applicant renewed his foreign passport, in part so there would be no problems\nwith his ownership of  property in Yugoslavia. To his knowledge, it was very difficult if not\nprohibited for non citizens to own property in what is now Serbia, and he co-owned with his mother\nan apartment in Belgrade that had been the family residence. It also did not feel right to Applicant\nto request the visa that would be required to travel to his native country on a U.S. passport.\nSometime after 2000, his mother purchased two seaside apartments in what is now\nindependent Montenegro.  She sold an apartment inherited from her parents, and used the funds to\n2\nbuy the properties. She listed herself and Applicant as co-owners on one and Applicant as sole owner\non the other. Applicant has since vacationed annually with his family (including his mother) on the\nMontenegrin seacoast, entering through Belgrade where he spent no more than a couple days visiting\nhis paternal aunts before proceeding to the seacoast. Following the defeat of the Milosevic\ngovernment in September 2000, non citizens could own property in Serbia, and visas were no longer\nrequired for U.S. citizens.  On subsequent trips to Serbia and Montenegro, Applicant carried both\n3\nhis U.S. and his Yugoslavian passports. He entered Serbia on his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\npassport in at least 2000, 2003, and 2004. Applicant renewed his U.S. passport for another ten years\nin May 2006, but also retained his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport for sentimental reasons\nand because he would have felt \u201cfunny\u201d to travel to his native land with just his U.S. passport. (Tr.\n32) \nOn March 6, 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) to apply for a security clearance.  He disclosed that he and his mother are dual\ncitizens of the U.S. and the Federation of Serbia and Montenegro, that he owns three apartments in\nSerbia and Montenegro, and that he holds a current Serbia and Montenegro passport. Applicant also\n\nThe record is inconclusive as to which passport he used in July 2005. Applicant\u2019s May 1996 U.S. passport was\n4\nnot available for review. His August 2000 Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport (Ex. 2) shows he used his\nYugoslavian passport to enter and/or exit Serbia in August 2000, July 2003, June 2004, and to exit in June 2006. It bears\nother stamps that are illegible. His latest U.S. passport, issued May 2006 (Ex. 2), bears a stamp from Serbia in June 2006.\nApparently, he entered Serbia on his U.S. passport. A check of the passport at his hearing revealed he used it to enter\nand exit Serbia in 2007. (Tr. 82)  \n5\nlisted his foreign travel to Serbia and Montenegro in August 2000, August 2001, August 2002, July\n2003, June 2004, and July 2005.4\nApplicant traveled to Serbia and Montenegro in June 2006. He gave little thought to which\npassport he was using. He entered Serbia on his U.S. passport and exited on his Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia passport.\n  \nIn late January 2007, Applicant responded to interrogatories from DOHA. He provided\ncopies of his current U.S. and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passports and denied any intent to\nrenew his foreign passport on its expiration (\u201cI have clear allegiance to the U.S. Serbia is my country\nof birth and I feel comfortable when I go there on vacation, but my life and home are here. This is\nwhy I am not planning to renew my Serbian passport when it expires in 2010.\u201d) (Ex. 2)\nAfter he received the SOR from DOHA, he realized his use of a foreign passport concerned\nthe government. Applicant went to Serbia and Montenegro for vacation from June 22, 2007 to July\n3, 2007. He used his U.S. passport exclusively on that trip.\nWhile attending church on October 16, 2007, Applicant heard  that all Serbian citizens would\nbe issued new passports in 2008 and that his passport, scheduled to expire in 2010, would not be\nvalid beyond December 31, 2008. He confirmed from a  Serbian media company\u2019s website that new\npassports are to be issued starting in March 2008 with a deadline of December 31, 2008, for\nchanging the current passports. The new passports are to meet European Union standards to ease\naccess to visas for its citizens traveling abroad. Applicant understands that the passport is not going\nto be issued automatically, but requires surrender of the old passport and an application, although\nthe available media report (Ex. A) neither confirms nor refutes that an application is required to\nobtain the new Serbian passport.\nApplicant is required to put in a vacation request with the FSO, who also serves as director\nof human resources. He reported his foreign travel to Serbia and Montenegro. She has known for\n\u201cquite a while\u201d that Applicant holds a foreign passport, but was unaware until late September/early\nOctober 2007 that there was a problem with dual passports. Informed by DOHA that another\nemployee of the company would have to surrender his foreign passport to her to hold while he held\na clearance, she discussed with Applicant the possibility of him turning in his passport to her as well.\nSince his hearing had been scheduled, they elected to wait to confirm if that was the proper way to\nhandle the passport issue. \nApplicant had both his U.S. and foreign passports with him at his hearing. He was uncertain\nhow best to handle his foreign passport as he did not want to renounce his Serbian citizenship, which\nhe feared would be the consequence of surrendering his passport to the Serbian Embassy. Applicant\nhas not seriously considered renouncing his Serbian citizenship (\u201cI couldn\u2019t do that to my mom.\u201d Tr.\n\nIt is not clear which of the two properties in Montenegro is solely owned by Applicant.\n5\n6\n60). He views it as dishonest to renounce citizenship for any material gain, such as  to obtain a\nsecurity clearance:\nSo I am just saying if I am loyal in the sense of being loyal to the fact that I was born\nthere, I have a citizenship, I\u2019m loyal to this country because it enabled me to achieve\nprofessional success and my family here, I also am going to be loyal, very loyal to\nthis country, but if someone renounced their citizenship in order to get a clearance,\nI think that\u2019s a person the Government should look at more carefully, I think, that\u2019s\nmy opinion. (Tr. 68-69)\nApplicant expressed his intent to surrender his foreign passport to his employer\u2019s FSO. On the\nafternoon of October 16, 2007, Applicant turned in his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport to\nthe FSO in front of three witnesses. (Ex. B)\nApplicant estimates that the apartment in Serbia is valued at 70,000 to 80,000 euros. The\nproperties in Montenegro have an estimated value of 180,000 to 200,000 euros and 40,000 and\n60,000 euros.  The properties are vacant until Applicant and/or his mother visit. His mother pays for\n5\na service to clean them in preparation for their arrival.\nApplicant owes an estimated $600,000 US on his mortgage for his home in the U.S. The\nhome is valued at $1.1 million. Applicant does not have a foreign bank account. When he travels to\nSerbia and Montenegro, he takes cash or withdraws funds from his U.S. bank accounts using an\nATM there. The balance on deposit in U.S. financial institutions was about $37,000 as of October\n2007. He has a 401(k) retirement account through his employer.\nApplicant and his current spouse have three children, a son born in March 2004 and twins\nabout 18 months old. As of October 2007, Applicant\u2019s mother was living with him and his family\nin the U.S., where she was helping to care for her grandchildren. She has a pension from the Serbian\ngovernment. Applicant\u2019s spouse works outside the home.\nApplicant\u2019s two paternal aunts are resident citizens of Belgrade, Serbia. They are his only\nconnection to his late father. One aunt is in her late 70s; the other is aged 84 or 85. They are retired\nand live off their state pensions (i.e., a social security type benefit). Applicant visits them before\nheading off to the Montenegrin seacoast for vacation annually with his family. Applicant brings them\nsmall gifts (pair of gloves, wallet, scarf) when he goes to Serbia. Once a year or less, Applicant gave\nhis aunts $50 to $100 when they needed it, such as for dental services. He has telephone contact a\ncouple times a year with his aunts on holidays.\n \nApplicant has been up-front with his FSO about his ownership of the apartments in Serbia\nand Montenegro. Over more than ten years at the company, Applicant has been diligent in following\nthe company\u2019s procedures regarding compliance with the regulations concerning international trade\nin armaments (ITAR). The president of the company has always worked very closely with Applicant.\nHe considers Applicant to be \u201cextremely well qualified\u201d in his field and a very good manager. (Tr.\n106). As a senior person in the company, Applicant is a principal investigator on several projects at\n\n7\nthe same time, including those involving unmanned vehicles. The lack of a clearance inhibits his\ncontributions.\nAt the request of the government, I take administrative notice of the following facts\nconcerning Serbia and its relationship with the United States. The Republic of Serbia is the self-\nproclaimed successor state to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) that was formed with\nMontenegro in April 1992 following the violent breakup along ethnic lines of the Socialist Federal\nRepublic of Yugoslavia. Led by Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia pursued a campaign of uniting ethnic\nSerbs in neighboring republics, which led to its ouster from the United Nations in 1992. In late 1998,\nthe Milosevic government unleashed a brutal police and military campaign against an ethnic\nAlbanian insurgency in the formerly autonomous Serbian province of Kosovo. The Milosevic\ngovernment\u2019s rejection of a proposed international settlement led to the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization (NATO) bombing of Serbia from March to June 1999, and the severance of diplomatic\nrelations between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the U.S. After 79 days of bombing,\nMilosevic capitulated and NATO-led forces moved into Kosovo. The U.S. reestablished a diplomatic\npresence and formally reopened its Embassy in Belgrade in May 2001 after mass protests led to the\ndefeat of the Milosevic government in September 2000 federal elections. With a broad coalition of\ndemocratic reformist parties in control, the country was once more accepted into the UN. In February\n2003, a new constitutional charter was adopted establishing a federation of two state republics,\nSerbia and Montenegro. Following Montenegro\u2019s declaration of independence in June 2006, Serbia\ndeclared itself a sovereign republic and the successor state to the union of Serbia and Montenegro,\nretaining Serbia and Montenegro\u2019s membership in all international organizations. As of June 2007,\nKosovo was legally part of Serbia but under the international protection of the U.N. and\npeacekeeping forces. Kosovo Albanians continue to advocate independence. The Serbian\ngovernment\u2019s position is that Kosovo should remain part of Serbia as an autonomous province. The\nU.S. supports the U.N. special envoy\u2019s call for Kosovo\u2019s independence subject to a period of\ninternational supervision.\nSince October 2000, Serbia has worked to stabilize and strengthen its bilateral relationships\nwith neighboring countries. Several warrants have been served for the arrests of persons indicted for\nwar crimes, but Serbia has not met all of its obligations to comply with the International Criminal\nTribunal for the former Yugoslavia as six persons indicted for war crimes remain at large. Admitted\nto the Council of Europe in 2003, Serbia is actively pursuing European Union (EU) and NATO\nmembership. In May 2006, the EU suspended talks toward accession because of Serbian inaction on\napprehending those indicted for war crimes, although talks resumed in June 2007 in the wake of\nSerbia\u2019s improved cooperation on the war crimes issue. In November 2006, NATO invited Serbia\ninto its Partnership for Peace, but  conditioned further progress on compliance with the International\nCriminal Tribunal. About $7 million in U.S. aid to Serbia for fiscal year 2006 was suspended\nbecause of Serbian lack of cooperation with the tribunal.\nSerbia and the U.S. have bilateral diplomatic relations and provide a full range of consular\nservices. U.S. citizens traveling with tourist, official, or diplomatic passports are not required to\nobtain a visa to enter Serbia and Montenegro for stays of up to 90 days. Visitors are required to\nregister with the police within 24 hours of their arrival. The Serbian government generally respects\nthe human rights of its citizens. Some problems persisted (including harassment of journalists,\nhuman rights workers, and others critical of the government, and limitations on freedom of speech\nand religion), but the government\u2019s increased efforts in addressing human rights violations brought\n\n8\nnotable improvements in 2006. There were no reports of arbitrary or unlawful killings by the\ngovernment, of politically motivated disappearances, or of government interference with peaceful\npublic protests. Complaints of excessive force by local police were under investigation. The\ngovernment generally observed the prohibition against arbitrary arrest or detention. Independent\nmedia organizations were active and expressed a wide range of views, although some media\norganizations experienced threats and reprisals for publishing views critical of the government.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960).

Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9) Applicant came to the U.S. in September 1986\non a graduate research fellowship. He moved his first wife and infant son temporarily to Belgrade\nin 1989 as he felt an obligation to work for the Serbian company that had continued to pay him while\nhe was performing his research in the U.S. In 1992, Applicant returned to the U.S. permanently. He\nbecame a naturalized citizen in March 1996, and a U.S. passport in May 1996. Yet he also  retained,\nand in August 2000 renewed, a Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport. Applicant used the Serbian\npassport in preference to his U.S. passport to enter and exit Serbia in at least 2000, August 2001,\nAugust 2002, July 2003, and June 2004, and to exit Serbia in 2006. While he used his U.S. passport\nexclusively on recent travel to Serbia and Montenegro in summer 2007, his foreign passport was still\nin his possession and valid for travel as of his October 2007 hearing for his clearance. Guideline C\nconcerns are implicated by Applicant\u2019s possession and use of a current Federal Republic of\n\nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s Serbian citizenship confers any property  ownership right or benefit (such\n6\nas lower property taxes) that would be unavailable to him were he solely a U.S. citizen. \n9\nYugoslavia passport. DC \u00b6 10(a)(1) (exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport) applies. Furthermore,\nsince he renewed his foreign passport so as not to jeopardize his property interest in the family\napartment in  Belgrade, \u00b6 10(a)(5) (using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interest\nin another country) also must be considered.\nApplicant clearly wants to retain his dual citizenship with Serbia and the U.S. (\u201cI couldn\u2019t\ndo that to my mom.\u201d Tr. 60).  He views it as dishonest to renounce citizenship for any material gain,\n6\nsuch as to obtain a security clearance. Retention of foreign citizenship acquired from birth out of\nrespect for one\u2019s ethnic heritage, for example, is not disqualifying in the absence of an exercise of\na right, privilege, or obligation of that citizenship. (See \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on\nparents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country)). Although renunciation of foreign citizenship is\nnot mandated for a clearance, there must be adequate assurances that Applicant will not in the future\nactively exercise his foreign citizenship. Applicant has exhibited a willingness to comply with DoD\nrequirements by surrendering his passport to his FSO following his hearing. (Ex. B). MC \u00b6 11(e) (the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated) applies. While Applicant is eligible to apply for the new Serbian passport that the\nSerbian government is planning to issue to its citizens in 2008, he testified credibly at his hearing\nthat he had no intent to renew his Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport when it expires. He is\nnot likely to seek one of the new passports when he does not physically possess the Federal Republic\nof Yugoslavia passport to provide to Serbian authorities, no longer needs a visa to travel to Serbia\nand Montenegro on his U.S. passport, and is accompanied on his vacations to Serbia and\nMontenegro by immediate family members (spouse and young children) who are solely citizens of\nthe U.S. and travel on U.S. passports.\n However, the surrender of the foreign passport to the FSO does not fully mitigate the foreign\npreference concerns. Applicant elected to surrender his foreign passport to the FSO rather than to\nthe Serbian Embassy because he feared it could have a negative effect on his Serbian citizenship.\nDespite significant ties to the U.S. (voluntary acquisition of U.S. citizenship, career in the U.S.,\nmarriage to a native U.S. citizen), he acted to protect a property interest in Serbia that is of less value\nthan his U.S. assets and even of his Montenegrin assets.  His affinity for Serbia goes beyond mere\nsentiment for his heritage. Under the totality of the circumstances, I am unable to predict with a\nreasonable degree of certainty that Applicant can be counted on to act solely with regard to the\ninterests of the U.S.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, foreign influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or\nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\n\nIn closing, Applicant argued unpersuasively that he does not have a substantial property in a foreign country\n7\n(\u201cFirst of all, the country in question is Serbia where I owe a single piece of property, while the other property is in\nMontenegro.\u201d Tr. 122). On his security clearance application, Applicant reported that he owned three properties in Serbia\nand Montenegro, and that he possessed a passport of Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia and Montenegro were not\nindependent when the properties were purchased, and Applicant did not distinguish that two of the properties were in\nMontenegro until his hearing. Applicant was clearly on notice that his three foreign properties were at issue.\n10\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). Applicant understandably feels close to his mother, who lives with him\nand remains subject to Serbian laws and authority because of her dual citizenship with Serbia and\nthe U.S. Applicant also has two paternal aunts, by his admission the only ties to his late father, who\nare resident citizens of Belgrade. DC \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure\nor coercion) and \u00b6 7 (d) (sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion) must be considered.\n Furthermore, Applicant co-owns with his mother the family apartment in Belgrade, with an\nestimated value of 70,000 to 80,000 euros, and a seaside apartment in Montenegro. Applicant is\nlisted as sole owner of a second apartment in Montenegro. Based on the most conservative estimate,\nhis financial interest in Montenegro could be worth upwards of 200,000 euros or, if he is sole owner\nof the less expensive property, about 130,000 euros. The Montenegrin assets are relevant and must\nbe considered despite the government\u2019s alleging mistakenly that all of the properties are within\nSerbian territory (see SOR \u00b6 2.c ).  Applicant has substantial property interests abroad that implicate\n7\nDC \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk\nof foreign influence or exploitation). He currently benefits from these foreign interests, in that he has\nvacationed in these seaside properties in Montenegro with his family about annually since they were\npurchased. En route to and from Montenegro, they stayed in the family apartment in Belgrade for\nabout a day and a half. His travel to Serbia (SOR \u00b6 2.d) is relevant to the extent that it confirms his\npersonal ties to his aunts ( \u00b6 2.b) and his enjoyment of his properties in Serbia and Montenegro (SOR\n\u00b6 2.c). But in the absence of any conduct while traveling that increased his vulnerability, \u00b6 7(i)\n(conduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country) does not\napply.\nConcerning Applicant\u2019s ongoing relations with his elderly aunts in Belgrade, he calls them\non holidays and visits them en route to his annual vacation in Montenegro. He also brings them small\ngifts and they attended his wedding in the U.S. His contact with them is infrequent, but it is not\nsufficiently casual in nature to be mitigated under \u00b6 8(c) (contact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation). Under \u00b6 8(a), even close ties with a foreign family member may be\nmitigated where the nature of the relationships with the foreign person, the country in which the\nperson is located, or the positions or activities or those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. Elderly\n\n11\npensioners of modest means, Applicant\u2019s aunts are not engaged in activities in Serbia which might\nbe of interest to those seeking U.S. sensitive information. Routine pension benefits as enjoyed by\nhis aunts as well as his mother do not heighten the risk. Applicant is not so close to his aunts that he\nwould jeopardize his immediate family members (spouse, children, and mother) who all enjoy the\nprotections of U.S. residency and citizenship. Although Applicant\u2019s mother vacations in Serbia and\nMontenegro annually, and she went to Serbia once or twice for some natural medicine treatment for\nher knees (Tr. 56), there is no indication of any untoward contacts during these trips.\nApplicant\u2019s foreign financial assets consist of real estate valued at more than 160,000 euros.\nIn determining whether his foreign property interests can be used to influence Applicant (see \u00b6 8(f)\n(the value or the routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that\nthey are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or\npressure the individual)), I must consider not only the dollar amount of the foreign financial interest,\nbut also its value in comparison to U.S. financial interests and the circumstances of the foreign\nfinancial interests and ties. (See ISCR Case No. 01-18860 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2003)). Even\naccounting for the diminished value of the dollar compared with the euro, the value of his U.S. assets\nexceeds his foreign assets. His home in the U.S. is worth about $1.1 million US and his mortgage\nbalance is about $600,000 (Tr. 43), which gives him about $500,000 in equity. In addition, he has\nhis salary, his 401K, and about $37,000 in bank deposits in the U.S.  Yet, after taking into account\nApplicant\u2019s emotional ties to Serbia, his plan to continue to vacation in Montenegro annually (see\nTr. 62), the financial benefit of staying in the apartments that are paid for (Q \u201cAnd is that cheaper\nthan staying in a hotel for a few nights?\u201d A \u201cOh, yes, much, much cheaper.\u201d Tr. 62), and his bonds\nwith his mother who owns two of the properties with him, the foreign property interests could well\nbe used to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. Applicant already showed a willingness to\ncomply with Serbian law by renewing his foreign passport in 2000 to protect his property stake in\nSerbia. \nThe political situation has changed considerably in Serbia since the institution of democratic\nreforms starting in late 2000. Serbia has not complied with the international mandate to turn over\nwar criminals for prosecution, but it also made significant improvements in the area of human rights\nin 2006. Despite its history of ethnic conflict and aggression, Serbia did not challenge Montenegro\u2019s\nindependence. It also has full diplomatic relations with the U.S. and is not known to target U.S.\ninterests. The government did not specifically request that I take official notice of any facts pertinent\nto Montenegro. What is of record concerning Montenegro is that non citizens were permitted to own\nproperty even before its independence from Serbia. Yet even friendly nations do not always have the\nsame interests. \nUnder the whole person analysis required (The adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible\nfor a security clearance, see AG \u00b6 2(a)), Applicant appears to be a person of considerable personal\nintegrity. He moved his first wife and then infant son to Belgrade in 1989 because he felt an\nobligation to the employer who had financially supported him while he pursued his research in the\nU.S. More recently, Applicant reported his foreign travel to his employer and showed that he can\nabide by ITAR and his employer\u2019s procedures. I am persuaded that Applicant would not knowingly\njeopardize his family in the U.S. However, his significant emotional and financial ties to Serbia and\nMontenegro (he even proposed to his current spouse at the Montenegrin seacoast) raise doubts as\n\n12\nto whether he can be counted on to act without regard to his foreign interests, particularly if he does\nnot perceive a conflict between the foreign interests and the U.S.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

The majority of\nthis use occurred while in college. He self-reported it on his security clearance application, and\nvoluntarily consulted with a counselor who concluded it was diagnostically insignificant, and that\nthe probability of future use was low. He has not smoked marijuana in more than a year. Applicant\nmitigated the security concern. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1992, as amended. Applicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2007 and requested a hearing.\nI was assigned the case on May 14, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 23, 2007,\nscheduling it for June 18, 2007. During the hearing, I received one government exhibit, four\nApplicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the transcript\non June 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 25-year-old single man who works for his employer as a manufacturing and\ndesign engineer. He graduated from college in May 2005 with a degree in mechanical engineering.\nHis supervisor, the chairman, chief financial officer, and president of the company, describes him\nas \u201cexceptionally mature beyond his years,\u201d and \u201cthe go-to-guy\u201d at work.  Also, he characterized\n1\nApplicant as an outstanding engineer with an innate ability to quickly comprehend abstract\nengineering concepts, and apply them to everyday tasks.  Applicant recently earned a raise equal to\n2\n50 per cent of his salary.3\nFrom age 16 to 25, Applicant smoked marijuana approximately twenty times.  The majority\n4\nof the use occurred in college. Since graduating from college he used it four times, twice during the\nsummer of 2005, once in December 2005, and once in July 2006. The most recent use occurred after\nhe had begun working with his current employer, and had completed a security clearance application.\n\nExhibit 1, Security Clearance Application, dated April 11, 2006, at 39.\n5\nExhibit D, Counselor\u2019s Report, dated June 8, 2007. Testimony of Counselor\u2013Tr. 89-90.\n6\nTr. 20, 90.\n7\nTr. 20; Tr. 91.\n8\nExhibit A, Statement of Intent, dated June 18, 2007.\n9\nTr. 15.\n10\n3\nApplicant reported his marijuana use on his security clearance application.   Later, he\n5\nvoluntarily consulted a chemical dependency counselor who concluded he did not meet the\ndiagnostic criteria for marijuana abuse or dependence, and that the probability that he was \u201cgoing\nto have a problem or going to use\u201d was low.  Consequently, he did not recommend Applicant attend\n6\ncounseling or receive any treatment. He did recommend that Applicant attend a 12-hour marijuana\neducation course, \u201cthe lowest level\u201d of intervention.  He has begun the course.\n7\n8\nApplicant has executed an affidavit promising not to use marijuana, and agreeing to subject\nhimself to random drug testing from his employer.  His supervisor is aware of his past marijuana use.\n9\nHe has not used marijuana since July 2006.10\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible  rules of law.\nInstead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in\nconjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2.,\nEnclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching impartial,\ncommon sense decisions.\nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these\nare: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the\nextent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\n\nSee Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n11\nExhibit A, Statement of Intent, executed June 18, 2007.\n12\n4\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline H - Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules and regulations.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n11\nthat are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe government is responsible for producing evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have\nbeen controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the government, and has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nDrug Involvement\nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement from 1997 to 2006 triggers the application of Drug\nInvolvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) 19(a): any drug abuse. Applicant voluntarily reported\nit. He has only used it four times in the past two years, and the last use occurred in July 2006. He\nexecuted an affidavit in which he promised not to use marijuana in the future, and agreed to undergo\na minimum of 12 screenings for illegal drugs for the next year.12\nAlso, Applicant voluntarily sought counseling. His counselor concluded his past use was\ndiagnostically insignificant, and that the probability of future use was low.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible and introspective. He recognized the bad judgment\ndisplayed by smoking marijuana after completing the security clearance application, and appeared\ngenuinely committed to abstinence. His testimony in conjunction with his supervisor\u2019s testimony\nconvinced me that he is a talented, mature individual. \nDrug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC) 26 (a): the behavior . . . does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and DI MC 26(b)(4): a\n\n5\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation, apply. Applicant has mitigated the drug\ninvolvement security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s use in the past two years has been sporadic, it cannot be characterized\nas remote. The last two times occurred while working at his current job, and the most recent use\noccurred after he completed his security clearance application. Conversely, averaging the sporadic\npost-college use with the more frequent college and high school use, it never exceed three to four\ntimes per year. Also, he has no clinical problems with marijuana abuse or dependence, and the\nprobability of him using it again is low according to the counselor. \nBased upon the counselor\u2019s observations, I conclude Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was more\nindicative of immaturity rather than any physical or psychological compulsion. He is now a more\nmature person who is dedicated to staying drug free. Both the potential for coercion and the\nlikelihood of recurrence is minimal.\nEvaluating these whole person factors in tandem with Applicant\u2019s credible testimony, and\nhis outstanding work ethic, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement security\nconcern. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT As to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR except \u00b6 1.b. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 5 complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old. He received a bachelor of science degree majoring in 6 information systems and a Ph.D in philosophy from a Chinese university. He was awarded a second Ph.D in ancient philosophy from a U.S. university in August 1994. He has no prior U.S. military service. He has never been married.

He does maintain a relatively close relationship with his younger brother, who is a citizen\nresident of China and maintains a relationship to a lesser extent with his elderly parents and older\nbrother, who are citizen residents of China. Applicant did not mitigate security concerns pertaining\nto foreign influence. Clearance is denied.\n\nG overnment Exhibit (G E) 1 (Electronic Standard Form (SF) 86, Security Clea rance\n1\nApplication). \n(Statement of Reasons (SO R), dated February 22, 2007).\n2\nO n A ugust 3 0, 2 006, the U nder Secretary of D efense (Intelligence) published a memorandum\n3\ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative G uidelines to all adjudications and other determinations\nmade under the D irective and D epartment of Defense (D oD ) R egulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security\nProgram  (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SO R was issued on or after\nSeptem ber 1, 2006. Applicant\u2019s case is resolved und er the revised Adjudicative G uidelines.\n(Applicant\u2019s response to SO R, notarized on January 2, 2 0 0 7 , received at D O H A on January\n4\n4, 20 07).\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 26, 2006, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).  On\n1\nFebruary 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to him,  pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\n2\nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  \n3\nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence). The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on March 12, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing.  On April 5, 2007, the case was assigned to me. His\n4\nhearing was held on May 16, 2007. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAdministrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Exhibit (Ex.)\n2 through 8. Tr. 9-11. Department Counsel also provided a supporting document (Ex.\n1) to show the basis for the facts in Exs. 2 through 8. Applicant did not object to my\ntaking administrative notice. Tr. 11. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd.

The most common basis for administrative\nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from\ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006)\n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took administrative notice of\nvarious facts derived from Exs. 2 through 8 as indicated under subheading \u201cPeople\u2019s\nRepublic of China\u201d of this decision.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR\nexcept \u00b6 1.b.  His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\n5\ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings\nof fact.  \nApplicant is 53 years old.  He received a bachelor of science degree majoring in\n6\ninformation systems and a Ph.D in philosophy from a Chinese university. He was\nawarded a second Ph.D in ancient philosophy from a U.S. university in August 1994. He\nhas no prior U.S. military service. He has never been married. He does not currently\nhold a security clearance. He has never been fired from a job, and he began his current\nemployment with a government contractor as a software application engineer in\nNovember 2004. There is no derogatory information concerning his police or financial\nrecords. He has never used illegal drugs.\nApplicant was born in China in 1954, and he moved to the United States in 1989.\nHe became a U.S. citizen in January 2001. He was issued a U.S. passport in February\n2003. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is approximately 81 years old, and she is a citizen resident\nof China. During her working life, she was a member of the Communist party and was\nemployed by the Chinese opera as \u201ckind of in charge of some parts of the opera.\u201d  Tr.\n25.  Applicant\u2019s father is approximately 91 years old, and he is a citizen resident of\nChina. During his working life, he was the deputy secretary of the communist party at\na Chinese university where he was employed.  Tr. 24-25.  Both of his parents have been\nretired \u201cbefore 1988, about 18 years ago.\u201d  Answer to SOR.\nApplicant communicates with his parents by telephone approximately two or three\ntimes a year, usually around a Chinese holiday.  Answer to SOR, Tr. 25.  His parents\nhave never visited the U.S.  \n\nT he contents of the PR C section are from Exs. 2 through 8.\n7\n4\nApplicant has two brothers, who are citizen residents of China.  His older brother\nis employed as a mathematician and his younger brother owns a workout shop, \u201ckind of\ngym.\u201d  Tr. 26.  Neither brother is a member of the Communist party.  \nApplicant communicates with his older brother by telephone \u201cabout twice a year\u201d\nand communicates with his younger brother by telephone \u201cabout 7 or 8 times a year.\u201d\nAnswer to SOR, Tr. 26-27.\nApplicant has a Chinese-born sister who came to the U.S \u201cin 1987 or 1988\" and\nlater became a U.S. citizen.  Answer to SOR,  Tr. 28.  She is currently married to a U.S.\ncitizen, and has a former husband she left behind in China.  She and her first husband\nhave an adult daughter and that daughter is attending a U.S. university.  His sister has\na medical degree, which she earned in China, but has never practiced medicine.  His\nsister is not currently working.  Applicant reports that he saw his sister one time in 1995\n\u201cfor a few days\u201d and communicates with her by telephone \u201conly briefly and at most once\na year.\u201d  Answer to SOR, Tr. 30-32. She goes back and forth to the PRC for lengthy\nvisits and at hearing date was currently visiting the PRC.  Tr. 32-33.  She is not a\nmember of the Communist party.\nIn 2005, Applicant visited the PRC for approximately two weeks and stayed with\nhis younger brother.  He reported his visit consisted of visiting his parents and brothers,\nsight seeing, and shopping.  Answer to SOR, Tr. 27.\nApplicant did not provide any character or reference statements nor did he call\nany witnesses on his behalf.  \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China  \n7\nChina has an authoritarian, Communist government. China has a poor human\nrights record, suppresses political dissent, and practices arbitrary arrest and detention,\nforced confessions, torture, and other prisoner mistreatment.\nChina is a nuclear power with a large Army. China is geographically vast, and has\na population of over one billion people. It has significant resources, and an economy\nthat in recent years has expanded about 10% per year. China aggressively competes with\nthe United States in many areas. China\u2019s competitive relationship with the United States\nexacerbates the risk posed by Applicant\u2019s Chinese connections.  \nChina actively collects military, economic and proprietary, industrial information\nabout the United States because of the following circumstances: (1) its position as a\nglobal superpower; (2) its military, political, and economic investments in the Pacific\nRim and Asia; (3) its leading role in development of advanced technology that China\ndesires for economic growth; and (4) China considers the large number of Americans\nof Chinese ancestry as intelligence targets. China\u2019s active intelligence gathering\nprograms focus on sensitive and protected U.S. technologies.\n\n \u201cSu b stantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n8\nad equate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary record.\u201d  ISC R Case N o. 04 -11 4 6 3  at 2\n(A p p . B d. Aug. 4, 200 6) (citing D ir evidence in the ective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cT his is something less than\nthe weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the\nevidence does not p revent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo\nv. Federal M aritim e Com m \u2019n, 38 3 U .S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSub stantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. W ashington M etro. Area Transit Auth., 3 6 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 19 94).\nth\n5\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge\nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to\nClassified Information\u201d (Guidelines). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s over-\narching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nGuideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the\nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial\nevidence.\u201d  The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish\n8\na case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly\n\n\u201cT he Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence a s a whole, both favorable and\n9\nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of\nthe D irective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under D irective \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case N o. 04-10340 at 2 (App. B d. July 6, 2006). \n6\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of a\ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses and other\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven\nby Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving\na mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at\n5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail\na certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual,\nrisk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in\npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or\npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and\ninterests\u201d stating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests,\n[he or she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization,\nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the\nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information\nand/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\n\n7\nGuideline \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and\nmay be disqualifying in this case, including:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire\nto help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is\nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative\nlives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor\nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially\nresult in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5\n(App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant\nhas infrequent contact with his parents and older brother.  He has more frequent\ncontact with his younger brother and maintains a relatively close relationship with\nhim. These contacts whether out of affection or obligation with his immediate family\nmembers create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. His\nrelationship with these immediate family members also creates a potential conflict of\ninterest because it is sufficiently close to raise a security concern about his desire to\nhelp his parents and brothers by providing sensitive or classified information. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying\nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a\nmitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating\ncondition never shifts to the Government.\nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are\npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense\nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n\n10ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003));\nISCR Case No.05-02833 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007) (citing Raffone v. Adams, 468 F.2d 860 (2nd Cir. 1972) (taken together, separate\nevents may have a significance that is missing when each event is viewed in isolation).\n See ISC R Ca se N o . 0 2 -2 4 5 6 6 at 3 (App. B d.

Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting\ncontention that eighth AP F is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence\ncases).\n8\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation;\nGuideline \u00b6 8(a) does not apply to his relationships with his parents and\nbrothers. His contacts with these immediate family members are not casual and\ninfrequent. If he does not contact these family members out of affection, he certainly\ndoes so understandably out of obligation. Applicant could be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between his parents and brothers and the interests of the United\nStates.\nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) does not apply because Appellant has not demonstrated in the\nevidence he presented a sufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S. that he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Although he\nlived in the United States since 1989, and became a U.S. citizen in 2001, he has not\ndemonstrated that he has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the\nU.S. such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest. The only immediate family member he has in the U.S. is a sister with\nwhom he has minimal contact. The facts presented by Applicant are insufficient to\novercome the security concerns as discussed in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra.  \nGuideline \u00b6 8(c) does not apply because of the regularity and consistency of his\ncontact with immediate family members in China.  \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to\nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept,\nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life\nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and\ncircumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are\n10\nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve\nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the\neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6\nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.  In addition to the\n11\n\n9\neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense\ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the\nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the\nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at\n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for 18 years, and he has been a\nnaturalized citizen for four years. When he became a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance\nto the United States. His sister is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. There is no evidence\nhe has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States.\nApplicant does appear to take his loyalty to the United States very seriously, and he has\nworked diligently for a defense contractor for almost three years.  \nFive circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis. First,\nChina is a nuclear power and China\u2019s government is a rival of the United States. China\nis an authoritarian, Communist state. More importantly for security purposes, China\nactively seeks classified and industrial/economic information. China may attempt to use\nhis parents and brothers who live in China to obtain such information. Second, he had\nsignificant connections to China before he emigrated to the United States in 1989. He\nwas born in China, and spent his formative years there. Third, his parents and two\nbrothers are citizen residents of China and his parents were members of the Communist\nparty. Although his contacts with his parents and older brother are minimal, he still\nmaintains a sense of loyalty and obligation to them which continues. Fourth, he has\nfrequent and non-casual contact with his younger brother as evidenced by his\nmaintaining telephone contact with him seven to eight times per year. He visited China\none time in 2005 for two weeks to visit his family since he arrived in the U.S.\nIndividually, these contacts may appear minimal, but collectively they demonstrate a\nsense of obligation and a connection with family members in China. Fifth, he has no\nknown ties with family members or persons with whom he maintains a close relationship\nwith in the U.S.  \nApplicant has demonstrated that his younger sister is a U.S. citizen and not a citizen resident\nof the PRC.  She does, however, maintain a close connection with China as evidenced by her\nfrequent return visits. \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong\npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it\nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by\ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir.\nth\n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the\n\nSee ISCR Case N o. 04-06242 at 2 (App. B d. June 28, 2006). \n12\n10\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. This is a close case, but ultimately the\nevidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d  and\n12\nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has\nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he\nis not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant, except for \u201cand sister\u201d\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security\nclearance for Applicant.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant is a native of Iran who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1989.  In 1996, he\nobtained and used an Iranian passport to visit his parents and participate in seminars in Iran.  He\nrenewed his Iranian passport in May 2005.  He is unwilling to surrender his Iranian passport because\nhe needs it to settle his father\u2019s estate in Iran.  His oldest brother is a citizen and resident of Iran.\nSecurity concerns based on foreign influence and foreign preference are not mitigated.  Clearance\nis denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn May 21, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and C (Foreign Preference).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 1, 2007, admitted one allegation, denied\nfour, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on July 25, 2007, and heard as\nscheduled on August 21, 2007.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on August 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 57-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor, for whom\nhe has worked since May 2003.  He holds a doctorate in mechanical engineering.  He has never held\na security clearance (Tr. 7).\nApplicant was born in Iran.  He came to the U.S. in 1975 to attend graduate school.  He\ncompleted his education in 1981, receiving a masters and a doctorate in mechanical engineering (Tr.\n39).  After the revolution in Iran, he decided to stay in the U.S., and he became a U.S. citizen in July\n1989.  His wife also was born in Iran.  They were married in the U.S. in December 1988, and she\nbecame a U.S. citizen in September 1994.  They have two children, both native-born U.S. citizens\n(Tr. 41).\nApplicant has two brothers and two sisters who were born in Iran.  His oldest brother worked\nfor the Iranian Ministry of Transportation as a low-level manager, responsible for scheduling\nintercity commercial transportation (Government Exhibit (GX 2) at 3).  He retired in 1999, received\nhis retirement in a lump sum (Tr. 52), and has no connection with the Iranian government.  This\nbrother lives in Iran but would like to come to the U.S. to be closer to his son (Tr. 61).  Applicant\nand his brother had regular conversations about the welfare of their parents until their parents died,\nwhen regular conversations stopped.  They now converse five or six times a year about settling the\nestate (Tr. 59).\nApplicant\u2019s other brother and one sister are citizens and residents of the U.S. His other sister\nhas a U.S. \u201cgreen card\u201d but lives in Greece (Tr. 44).\nApplicant obtained an Iranian passport in 1996, after becoming a U.S. citizen, and he used\nit to visit his parents in Iran and participate in two seminars.  He does not consider himself a dual\ncitizen of Iran and the U.S., but he used his Iranian passport to enter and leave Iran because it was\n\n4\nmore convenient (AX A at 1-2); AX B).  The passport expired in 2001.  He obtained a new Iranian\npassport in May 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s mother died in March 2005, and his father died in September 2006.  He used his\nIranian passport when he gave his oldest brother a power of attorney to settle his father\u2019s estate (GX\n3 at 1).  He testified the Iranian courts would not accept any documents unless he submitted his\nIranian passport along with the documents (Tr. 71).  In response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated\nhe intended to surrender his Iranian passport after his father\u2019s estate is settled (GX 2 at 12).\nApplicant has no interest in sharing in his father\u2019s estate, and he does not know what the\nestate is worth (Tr. 47).  He executed an affidavit declaring his desire to give his interest in the estate\nto his brother (Attachment to Answer to SOR), but he is unwilling to surrender his Iranian passport\nuntil the estate is closed and all property distributed. He fears that the government will find some\nway to invalidate his power of attorney and require it to be revised.  If they do, he would not be able\nto submit a revised power of attorney to the courts without a passport, and the courts would not\nrelease the inheritance to his siblings as long as he is alive (AB B at 2). \nAt Department Counsel\u2019s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took\nadministrative notice of relevant adjudicative facts about Iran (Hearing Exhibit (HX) I; Tr. 14).  Iran\nis a theocratic Islamic republic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political authority\nvested in a learned religious scholar. Current U.S. concerns about Iran are based on its efforts to\nacquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction; support for and involvement in\ninternational terrorism; support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process; and its\nhuman rights abuses, including summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and\nrestrictions on civil liberties.  Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to Shia political\nand militant groups in Iraq.  It also provides encouragement, training, funding, and weapons to anti-\nIsraeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process (HX I at 1-5).\nThe U.S. has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism.  The U.S. broke diplomatic\nrelations with Iran in April 1980, prohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and\ndiplomatic pressure to contain the threats posed by Iran (HX I at 3). \nIran does not recognize dual citizenship. Iranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens are\nconsidered solely Iranian citizens by the Iranian authorities, and they are subject to surveillance,\nsearch, harassment, arrest, and imprisonment while traveling or residing in Iran (HX I at 5).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\n\n5\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Iran and a former\ngovernment employee (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that Applicant will inherit property from his deceased father\nwhen the will is probated (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  The concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign\ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or\ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited\nto, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to\nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019s\ncontacts with his brother in Iran raise these two disqualifying conditions.\n\n6\nA disqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property\ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could\nsubject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e).  Although\nApplicant has declared his intention to give his share of their father\u2019s estate to his brother, he wants\nto ensure that the estate will be distributed to his siblings.  His interest in his father\u2019s estate and his\ndesire to control its disposition raise this disqualifying condition.   The record does not reflect the\nvalue of the estate, but its proper distribution is a matter of concern to Applicant.  I conclude this\ndisqualifying condition is established.\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S. \nFamily ties with persons in a foreign country are not, as a matter of law, automatically\ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, such ties raise a prima facie security concern sufficient\nto require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet\nthe applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for the applicant.  See Directive\u00b6 E3.1.15; ISCR Case No. 99-0424,\n2001 WL 675725 at *12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  Iran\u2019s hostility to the U.S., repressive government, and\nabysmal human rights record place a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on Applicant to\ndemonstrate that his family member and financial interests in Iran do not pose a security risk.  See\nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug 4, 2006).\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  Applicant\u2019s brother wants to live in the\nU.S., but as long as he lives under the repressive and hostile government of Iran, Applicant may be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of his brother and the interests of the\nU.S.  This mitigating condition is not established.\n\n7\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is no conflict\nof interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in\nfavor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).  Applicant has deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., but he also has loyalty to his brother and is deeply concerned that his siblings\nreceive their inheritance.  His reluctance to surrender his passport, even though he knows it raises\na security concern, demonstrates his dilemma.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not\nestablished.\nSecurity concerns can be mitigated by showing \u201ccontact or communication with foreign\ncitizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an\nimmediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App.\nBd. Feb. 1, 2002).  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption.  Applicant talks with his brother less\nfrequently than he did when their parents were alive, but they still converse regularly about their\nfather\u2019s estate, a matter of serious concern.  This mitigating condition is not established. \nSecurity concerns based on foreign property interests also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe\nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are\nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure\nthe individual.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(f).  The value of Applicant\u2019s father\u2019s estate is not established, but the record\nclearly reflects that its disposition is a matter of importance to Applicant.  I conclude Applicant has\nnot met his burden of establishing this mitigating condition.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.a), he obtained\nan Iranian passport in 1996 after becoming a U.S. citizen and used it to visit his parents in Iran (SOR\n\u00b6 2.b), and he renewed his Iranian passport in order to resolve matters related to his father\u2019s estate\n(SOR \u00b6 2.c).  The concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way\nas to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone\nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  AG\n\u00b6 9.  A disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a\ncurrent foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).  Applicant\u2019s possession and use of an Iranian passport\nraise this disqualifying condition.\nDual citizenship is not a disqualifying condition, unless it is exercised.  Thus, the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6 2.a have little security significance standing alone.  The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c\nare premised on Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship, thus incorporating and duplicating SOR \u00b6 2.a.  When\nthe same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicate\nallegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep.\n21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a. in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Security concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by\n\n8\nevidence that \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 11(a).   This mitigating condition is established.  Security concerns based on possession or use\nof a foreign passport can be mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). This condition is not\nestablished.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Some of these factors have been discussed above, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult who has spent all his professional life in the U.S.  He was sincere,\ncandid, and credible at the hearing.  His loyalty to the U.S. is not an issue.  Nevertheless, his\nbrother\u2019s Iranian citizenship and residence and his concern about the distribution of his father\u2019s\nestate make him vulnerable.\nI have weighed the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C\nand B; considered the nature of the Iranian government, its human rights record, its involvement in\ninternational terrorism, and its efforts to foster instability in neighboring countries; considered the\ntotality of Applicant\u2019s family ties as well as each family tie; and evaluated all the evidence in the\ncontext of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on\nforeign  influence and foreign preference.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of\nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from high school in 1978. Shortly after that she was employed with an army depot from 1978 until 1980 and held a secret clearance. She is married and has four children. Applicant has been with her current employer 2 since April 2004.3 Applicant and her husband both worked during their marriage until Applicant\u2019s husband was severely injured in an automobile accident in October 1997. As a result of that accident, her husband is permanently disabled, and has never been able to return to work.

On May 4, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR on May 30, 2007, and elected to\nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 29, 2007. I\nscheduled a hearing for September 12, 2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on September 12, 2007, via a video teleconference\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Government exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A-\nG) were admitted into the record without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant. Applicant\nhad one witness testify on her behalf as reflected in the hearing transcript. The transcript (Tr.)  was\nreceived on September 20, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from high school\nin 1978. Shortly after that she was employed with an army depot from 1978 until 1980 and held a\nsecret clearance.  She is married and has four children. Applicant has been with her current employer\n2\nsince April 2004.3\nApplicant and her husband both worked during their marriage until Applicant\u2019s husband was\nseverely injured in an automobile accident in October 1997. As a result of that accident, her husband\nis permanently disabled, and has never been able to return to work.  Although Applicant continued\n4\nto work, she could not pay all the medical bills and other normal bills because her husband received\nno disability for two years, and they were living on Applicant\u2019s income. She filed for Chapter 13\nBankruptcy in October 1998. Under that plan she made payments successfully and the case was\ndischarged in 2002.5\n\nTr. 19.\n6\nAE B (Newspaper Article, dated February 2003).\n7\nAE C (Newspaper Article, dated September 2006).\n8\nTr. 26.\n9\nGE 5 (Credit Bureau Report); Tr 31.\n10\nGE 4 (Answers to Interrogatories).\n11\nTr. 76.\n12\nTr. 52.\n13\n4\nFrom 1983 until August 2002, Applicant was engaged in steady employment. However she\nwas laid off from her employment, and remained so until the end of 2003.  In February 2003, her\n6\nthree children were involved in a very serious automobile accident. Two of the children suffered very\nserious injuries.  Her son required extensive facial surgery.  Since she was unemployed, Applicant\n7\nhad no medical insurance to cover any medical or hospital costs. \nIn the middle of 2003, Applicant\u2019s other son developed spinal meningitis. He was gravely\nill for two years.  She could not obtain health insurance for him due to the pre-existing condition.\n8\nHe remained at home and was home schooled. Despite the severe injuries and illness her three\nchildren are now in college. Applicant has supported them and her husband by living on food stamps\nand unemployment insurance.9\nApplicant has $27,770 in delinquent debt.  The majority of the debt is for unpaid medical\n10\nbills. (Allegations 1.b-bb, with the exception of 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i which are paid). Applicant did\nnot receive notices for the medical bills until she looked at a credit report after her security clearance\napplication. The alleged debts in the SOR were listed as \u201cmedical provider.\u201d She immediately\nresearched her credit and called to find out what the debts were for and if they were with a collection\nagency. Applicant learned that $11,491 was owed to a particular hospital and that $12,876 was to\nanother hospital for surgery that her son had in 2003.  \n11\nApplicant contacted a company for debt consolidation. However, she was referred to another\norganization. When she contacted them, she learned that they required a fee before a repayment plan\ncould be developed. She could not afford the fee.12\nIn 2003, Applicant and her husband separated and divorced in 2004.  However, they\n13\nremarried shortly after. One of the telephone bills in allegation 1.f is disputed because she was not\nliving at the address where the bills were sent.\nApplicant started a financial counseling course and is almost finished. She has developed a\nbudget and was advised not to do a repayment plan, but rather to pay off her smallest debts first. She\nhas already paid the following debts: allegation 1.d for a television service ($189); allegation 1.e for\na credit account ($655); allegation 1.h for an electric bill ($363); and allegation 1.i. for a land line\n($162).\n\nTestimony of witness at Tr. 97.\n14\nTr. 87; AE A (Financial Statement).\n15\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n19\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n20\n5\nIn 2004, Applicant started her current employment. She is described as a very hard working\nand honest person. She needs a security clearance to retain the employment. Her colleague, who has\nknown Applicant since the 1990's attests to Applicant\u2019s character and ability to handle situations.\nShe takes pride in her work, and is intelligent.  She has never had any difficulty maintaining her\n14\npositions of responsibility during the last 20 years.  \nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income, which includes her husband\u2019s disability pay, is\n$2,770. After expenses, she has a net monthly remainder of $170.85. She is current on her mortgage\nand car payments. Her vehicle will be paid in full soon and she will have more income to pay her\ndelinquent debts.15\nIn 2005, when Applicant answered Section 28 (a) and (b) concerning any delinquent debts\nmore than 90 or 180 days overdue, she answered \u201cno.\u201d She did not know that she had any at that\ntime. In fact, she did list in Section 27 her bankruptcy and an unpaid bill from 2004. Applicant was\ncredible in her explanation at the hearing that she had no intent to deceive the government. She\nhonestly had not seen a credit report and did not realize that any medical accounts were listed. She\ndid not receive any notice for the telephone or utility bill because she had moved to a different\naddress during her separation and divorce from her husband. I found her answers reasonable and her\ntestimony credible.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n16\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n17\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n18\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n19\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n20\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n21\n6\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n21\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts, resulting in bankruptcy, establishes Financial\nConsiderations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Her admissions and credit reports\nconfirm the delinquent debts since the bankruptcy discharge in 2002.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20 (a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with creditors does not cast doubt on her current\nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. She has shown sufficient unusual circumstances to\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors\n22\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\nSee ISCR 04-07360 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (stating partial credit was available under FC MC 6 for\n23\ndebts being resolved through garnishment). \n7\nestablish that her financial problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201dApplicant suffered a period of\nunemployment, loss of her husband\u2019s income due to a severe injury in a car accident and two\nindividual incidents of injuries/ illness for her three children. These were all beyond her control and\nshe acted in a responsible manner. I find that FC MC 20(a) is partially applicable. FC MC 20(b) is\napplicable for the reasons stated above. \nFC MC 20(c) applies due to the counseling course that Applicant is attending. She also\npursued information on a repayment plan prior to her new decision to pay only the smaller debts\nfirst.  She has paid some of the debts listed in the SOR. She also merits some credit for using\n22\nbankruptcy, which is a legal means for resolving his debts.  Bankruptcy substantially reduced her\n23\ndebts, and accordingly reduced her potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements.      \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nOn July 20, 2005, Applicant, in response to Section 28 (a) and (b) concerning financial\ndelinquencies answered \u201cno.\u201d When she responded to the questions, she did not know that the\nmedical bills or any other accounts were overdue. She had never received any notices of these\naccounts. She listed her bankruptcy and another unpaid bill in Section 27.\nUnder DC 16 (a), the government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from her\nanswer to Section 28. She denied that she deliberately or knowingly falsified an answer to her\nsecurity clearance application. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has\nthe burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\nApplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence regarding an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC\n\n8\n16 (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from an\npersonnel security questionnaire.....) To apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\nomission was deliberate. I do not find that this was a deliberate falsification. I find in favor of\nApplicant for personal conduct.\nGuideline J Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy it\u2019s very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nBased on my conclusion that Applicant did not falsify her answers on her security clearance\napplication, as discussed under Personal Conduct. There is no basis for a Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition. The allegations under Criminal Conduct are found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nA series of unfortunate events led to Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and ultimately to her\nfiling bankruptcy. Applicant used a legally available option to address her debts. As stated above,\nbankruptcy eliminated Applicant\u2019s debts, and accordingly reduced her potential vulnerability to\nimproper financial inducements. In 2003, Applicant suffered more loss. Her children were in a\nserious car crash and later her son developed meningitis. She lost her steady employment and her\nhusband was not able to return to work due to his permanent disability. Applicant did the best she\ncould to raise her family and pay her bills. The stress of these conditions resulted in a short divorce\nfor Applicant and her husband. They are now together. Applicant had successfully completed her\nChapter 13 repayment plan which attests to her commitment to pay her debts. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her financial issues, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. She is eligible for a security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:-1.bb:\n            For Applicant\nParagraph 2.

J (Agreement for Consulting Services, Certified Foreclosure Consultant, dated January 8, 2003).\n9\n4\n1.1  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in April 2007 levied upon your earnings\nfrom your employer [employer\u2019s name] for past due federal income tax for the year\n2001. In May 2007 the IRS commenced collecting past due income taxes by\ngarnishment from your [employer\u2019s name] earnings.\nIn the absence of an objection, the Government\u2019s request to amend the SOR was granted.\nAccordingly, the SOR is amended as stated above.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e through 1.l.\nThose admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the allegations in\nsubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is 42 years old and works as a technical librarian/editor for a defense contractor.\nShe has worked at the same job, minus 15 months, since 1989. She has an associate\u2019s degree in\nscience and chemistry, a bachelor\u2019s degree in English, and is completing a master\u2019s degree in\nprofessional writing. Her employer is funding her graduate education.  She was in the Air National\n5\nGuard part-time from 1989 until her resignation in 2004. Applicant admits that her secret clearance\nwas revoked on September 9, 2004, due to financial issues.6\nApplicant has three children, aged 18, 14, and 6. The two older children are from her first\nmarriage in 1988, which ended in divorce in 1994. Since 1995, a child support order for the two\nolder children in the amount of $496 per month has been in effect. In 2007, her ex-husband was in\na serious car accident related to work. On May 30, 2007, he ceased paying child support because he\ndid not believe he would recover and because he was unemployed.  She is trying to modify the child\n7\nsupport order for a reduced payment while he recuperates.8\nAfter her divorce, Applicant purchased a home in 1994 for $89,000, with a Veteran\u2019s\nAdministration loan. She owned the house four years before she remarried. The property was\nforeclosed in June 2003. Prior to the foreclosure, she worked with a foreclosure consulting service\nto resolve her mortgage issues.  After the foreclosure, she worked with a federal credit union and\n9\nthey assisted her in streamlining her personal debts and car loan.\n\nTr. 30.\n10\nId. at 43-44.\n11\nEx. 3, note 2, supra.\n12\nTr. 29.\n13\nId. at 30.\n14\nEx. L (Letter, dated April 14, 2007).\n15\nTr. 58.\n16\nEx. L (Consent Order, Case No.: 07-1714 CIV).\n17\n5\nIn 1998, Applicant remarried, and her youngest child is a result of this marriage. When they\nmarried, he was the bread winner, earning more than her.  With two incomes and a stable financial\n10\nsituation, in 1999, Applicant borrowed $30,000 from her profit-sharing plan to invest in a music\nstudio in the basement of the house for her husband.  He wanted to start his own business, so she\n11\nthought it would be a good investment. Their family was forbidden to enter his music studio. After\nthe birth of their child in December 2000, they agreed that Applicant would stay home and they\nwould financially be provided for with the use of her profit-sharing, his full-time job, and her miliary\nmonthly drill checks. In January 2002, he was laid off from his full-time job. The Air National Guard\nwas able to put her on active duty with intermittent orders.  Eventually, they were both re-employed,\n12\nand their lives stabilized. In 2004, Applicant learned that her husband was using alcohol and drugs.\nTheir pastor counseled them but her husband refused to go through any treatment program. \nIn August 2000, March 2002, and October 2002, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection\nunder Chapter 13. The bankruptcies were dismissed for failure to make payments. In June 2004, she\nfiled for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. The bankruptcy was dismissed for failure to\ncomplete the required filing. Applicant stated that she filed these bankruptcies based on the advice\nshe received from her attorney.  All bankruptcies reflected the same debts.\n13\n14\nOn October 14, 2005, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7. Her debts\nwere discharged on January 25, 2006. Her liabilities totaled $46,796. Her assets totaled $3,350.\nOn April 4, 2007, Applicant and her husband separated after he sold off most of the\nequipment in the studio.  Her divorce will be final in 2008. She was obligated to pay back the loan\n15\nshe received from her profit sharing through payroll deductions shortly after it was approved. She\nfiled for child support for their youngest child.  Applicant provided a copy of consent order for child\n16\nsupport filed against her estranged husband.  Effective September 1, 2007, he was ordered to pay\n17\n$336 per month for his now six-year-old daughter.\nThe SOR lists five outstanding delinquent debts totaling $13,220. The debts are as follows:\n\nTr. 50.\n18\nId. at 52.\n19\nId. at 53; Ex. 13 (Bankruptcy Petition, Schedule F).\n20\nId. at. 54; Ex.

D (Character letter, dated August 9, 2007).\n25\n6\n!Tax lien for $1,115 was filed against her for unpaid state income taxes. Tax lien for\n$8,546 was filed against her for the tax years 1999 and 2000. Both of these debts are\nbeing paid through a payroll deduction of $224 per month.18\n!Two medical debts for $272. Applicant is contesting these charges with the three\ncredit bureaus.19\n!Telephone debt for $1,304 in collections. This debt was covered in the 2005\nChapter 7 bankruptcy.20\n!Student loan for $1,983 in collections. She has a payment plan for this loan, which\nis $50 a week, starting September 2007.21\n!IRS levied a garnishment on Applicant\u2019s earnings in April 2007 for past due federal\nincome tax for the year 2001. A payment of $100 a month is deducted directly from\nher pay for this debt.\nApplicant stated this about her financial situation: \u201cI\u2019ve been honest with all of my immediate\nsupervisors and coworkers, and my ministerial staff at my church about my financial challenges and\nhave remained loyal and honest to my employer. And my integrity has never had need to be\nquestioned.\u201d22\nApplicant submitted five character reference letters from colleagues at work.  They\n23\nenthusiastically endorsed her security clearance application. They commented that Applicant \u201chas\nshown a high degree of integrity, responsibility, resourcefulness, and leadership.\u201d  Another stated\n24\n\u201cAlthough she has had to struggle to make ends meet \u2013 she maintains an upbeat and positive attitude.\nShe is a faithful member of her church, attending regularly with her children. She helps with many\noutreach programs sponsored by her church.\u201d25\n\nEx. F (Character letter, dated August 8, 2007).\n26\nTr. 38.\n27\nEx.

He stated:\n26\nI counseled [Applicant] through all of these months and continue to meet with her\ntwice a week to discuss her finances, her mental state and her plans, and she remains\npositive and working on a plan to become credit worthy again. She has separated\nfrom her husband as a result of his drug and alcohol use and has purposed [sic] to file\nfor divorce next year and move on with her life. \nApplicant earns $60,000 a year. She also does freelance writing, which amounts to about\n$300 to $500 per month.  She also accepted a part-time administrative position beginning August\n27\n30, 2007, working 10-15 hours per week. She will be paid $100 weekly, not to exceed $400 a\nmonth.28\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n29\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n30\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n31\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n32\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n33\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n34\n8\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.34\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in listed\nin the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all facts in evidence and the legal standards, and I reach the\nfollowing conclusions.\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems. \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d\nThe Government has proved a prima facie case for financial considerations. Applicant has\na long history of financial problems going back to 1998. In January 2006, her debts were discharged\nin bankruptcy. Subsequently, she accumulated five delinquent debts, totaling $13,220. Accordingly,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply.\nVarious factors can mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Applicant lost her\nhouse to foreclosure. Her two marriages assisted in unraveling her finances. She divorced one\nhusband and plans on divorcing her second husband in 2008. Her second marriage included her\nunemployment caused by birth of a baby and her spouse was laid off from work. She bounced back\nfrom a bankruptcy discharge in 2006. She has paid the outstanding tax debts and student loan that\nwere not dischargeable in bankruptcy. She challenged two debts are on her credit report with three\ncredit bureaus. Moreover, Applicant has demonstrated that her financial problems are unlikely to\nrecur. She continues to do freelance writing and earns an additional $300 to $500 each month.\nMoreover, she had found a part-time job and will continue to enhance her financial coffers. Hence,\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances), \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling\nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol), \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts), and \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\n\n9\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) apply.\nI now turn to the general factors of the whole person concept. Applicant is 42 years old and\nhas obviously had some financial setbacks in her life starting around 1998. She is keenly aware of\nher delinquent debts and sought both financial and pastoral counseling. She credibly testified that\nshe works in an environment where she excels. This is evidenced by her job paying for her master\u2019s\neducation. Applicant has matured during her financial downturn. She did not always get the best\nadvice when seeking it from professionals, when dealing with the foreclosure of her house or filing\nnumerous bankruptcies that were dismissed for failure to make payments. Yet, she persevered. She\nenhances her finances by doing freelance writing and she recently found a part-time job. She is well\non her way to becoming financially solvent. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable\nfor access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nJacqueline T. Williams\n Administrative Judge\n",
