Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 24, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\n\n2\nrequested a hearing.  On November 12, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H.\nMogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge considered all the\nrecord evidence; and (2) whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFor the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant has experienced financial difficulties as evidenced by\nnumerous outstanding and overdue consumer credit card and medical debts.  Applicant testified that\nthe majority of her debts are the result of medical bills that her family has accrued over the years,\nincluding a medical condition of her husband that left him unemployed for a time.  Notwithstanding\nApplicant\u2019s assertions, the Judge found that the majority of the debts listed on the SOR were for\ncredit card debt rather than medical bills.  Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant does not\nattribute most of her financial difficulties to the fact of her husband\u2019s unemployment.  The Judge\nconcluded that there was little evidence introduced to establish that Applicant has resolved most of\nthe overdue debts, and a great deal of her debt is from overuse of credit cards.  Because of this and\nApplicant\u2019s lack of a stable economic outlook, the Judge resolved Guideline F against her. \nApplicant argues that she provided evidence that she had made payments toward her debt and\nthat she and her husband were engaged in financial counseling, and this evidence was ignored and\nnot taken into consideration.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge has considered all the\nrecord evidence unless he or she indicates otherwise.  That presumption is not overcome here.  A\nreview of the evidence, including a post-hearing submission proffered by Applicant, reveals that the\nJudge specifically references Applicant\u2019s efforts at debt repayment and her attempts to obtain debt\ncounseling.    \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He discussed the applicability of Guideline F mitigating conditions and\ncogently explained why there was insufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns, stressing the facts that Applicant\u2019s debts are largely unresolved and her current financial\nprofile does not suggest that she is in a position to meaningfully resolve her overdue indebtedness.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1.  In her brief, Applicant states that she is a DoD civilian employee and was formerly a\n1\ngovernment contractor.\n3\nApplicant states that her current job requires only a confidential clearance and does not\nunderstand why she was processed for a secret clearance.  The level of clearance currently held, or\nthe level of clearance applied for do not affect the Judge\u2019s analysis or the Board\u2019s review.  Directive\n\u00b6 3.2 makes no distinction concerning basic clearance levels in its procedures for deciding whether\naccess to classified information is clearly in the national interest.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at\n3 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007).    \nApplicant states that her case should have been seen under different circumstances due to her\nfederal contractor employment status.  Applicant fails to state with sufficient specificity how the fact\nof her employment status established error in the Judge\u2019s analysis.  To the extent that Applicant may\nbe raising a jurisdictional issue, it is not dispositive in this case.  There is no record evidence that\nsuggests that Applicant was anything other than a contractor employee at the commencement of the\nsecurity clearance application process or that her status changed prior to the hearing.   According to\n1\nthe Directive, \u00b6 4.4, the DOHA security clearance adjudication process is not normally terminated\nonce a hearing has commenced.  \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 12, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn March 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR), in writing on May 6, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on June 3, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 8,\n2009, and the hearing convened on July 23, 2009, in Honolulu, Hawaii. \nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without\nobjection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, and she submitted Exhibits A through\nR, which were entered into evidence without objection. The transcript (Tr) was received\n\n2\non August 12, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until August\n7, 2009, to submit additional documents. She timely submitted additional documents,\nwhich have been identified and entered into evidence collectively as Exhibit S. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 29 years old. She is married, and she and her husband have two\nchildren. Applicant is employed as a supply clerk by a defense contractor, and she\nseeks a DoD security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nsector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 15 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.o., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as\nthey were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,047. At the\nhearing, Applicant testified that she believed that she made two online payments on this\ndebt in the amounts of $75 and $50 (Tr at 31-33). While Exhibit I has a hand written\nnotation from Applicant showing a payment of $50 on this debt, it does not establish that\nany payments have been made. Exhibit S includes a further notation from Applicant that\nindicates she made a payment of $100 on July 27, 2009, to this creditor. I find no\nevidence that a payment was made, and the majority of this debt is still outstanding.\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $226. Applicant\ntestified that she has made some payments to a collection agency on this debt, and on\nother debts that she owes to this creditor (Tr at 33-35). Exhibit E shows Applicant has\nmade payments of $148.84 and $225.98 to this creditor, but there is no evidence as to\nwhich debts these payments were applied.  I cannot find that this debt has been\nresolved. \n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $409. Applicant\ntestified that she has not paid this debt (Tr at 35-36). I find that this debt has not been\nresolved. \n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $83 with a total\nbalance of $683. Applicant testified that she has not paid this debt (Tr at 36-38). I find\nthat this debt has not been resolved. \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,319.  Applicant\ntestified that she has not paid this debt (Tr at 38). I find that this debt has not been\nresolved. \n1.f. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $121 with a total\nbalance of $546. Applicant testified that this debt has not been paid (Tr at 38). I find that\nthis debt has not been resolved. \n1.g. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $24 with a total\nbalance of $574.Applicant testified that she has not paid this debt (Tr at 38-39). I find\nthat this debt has not been resolved. \n1.h. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $733. Applicant\ntestified that she has not paid this debt (Tr at 39-40). I find that this debt has not been\nresolved. \n1.i. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,933. Applicant\ntestified that she has not paid this debt although she plans to include it as part of a\npayment plan through her consumer credit counseling service (CCCS) (Tr at 40).\nHowever, during her later testimony, Applicant claimed that this had been a debt of her\nhusband before they were married, and it had been resolved, so in either case the debt\nshould not be assessed against her (Tr at 51-53). No evidence was introduced to show\nthat this debt was either resolved or was not hers. Therefore, I cannot find that this debt\nhas been resolved. \n1.j.  This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $147. Applicant\ntestified that she has paid this debt (Tr at 40-41). Exhibit D is a notation from Applicant\nin which she writes that she has made a payment of $123.20 to pay this debt in full. I do\nnot find that any independent evidence has been submitted to establish that this debt\nhas been resolved. \n1.k.  This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,766. Applicant\ntestified that she has made some payments to a collection agency on this debt and on\nother debts that she owes to this creditor (Tr at 33-35,41-43). As reviewed in 1.b.,\nabove, Exhibit E shows Applicant has made payments of $148.84 and $225.98 to this\ncreditor, but there is no evidence as to which debts these payments were applied. I\ncannot find that this debt has been resolved. \n1.l.   This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $404. This is the\nthird debt, with 1.b. and 1.k, above, to which Applicant has made some payments to a\ncollection agency. Again, because there is no evidence as to which debts these\npayments were applied. I cannot find that this debt has been resolved. \n1.m. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $118. Applicant\ntestified that she has paid this debt along with 1.n., below (Tr at 44-45). Attached to\nApplicant\u2019s RSOR is a notation by Applicant that she made a payment of $231, which\nshe testified was to resolve this debt and 1.n., below. Exhibit S includes a letter from\n\n4\nthis creditor, dated April 17, 2009, which indicates that they received a payment of\n$137.07 and that the current balance is $0. However, based on Exhibit 3, it appears that\nthis applies to 1.n, below. I find that this debt has not been resolved. \n1.n.  This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $113. While\nApplicant claimed she paid this debt along with 1.m, above, Exhibit S only establishes\nthat one of the debts has been paid. I find that this debt has been resolved.\n1.o.  This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,175. Applicant\ntestified that she has made one payment towards this debt, but the amount now owed\nhas actually increased to $1,446.90 (Tr at 45-46).\nApplicant testified that the majority of her debts are as a result of medical bills\nthat her family has accrued over the years. These have included multiple knee surgeries\nfor her husband, and hospital bills because her older daughter had severe stomach pain\nand had to spend a few nights in the hospital. She contended that they had always had\nmedical insurance, and she has never received an proper explanation for why the\nmedical bills of her family were not covered adequately. Applicant did concede that\nsome of her debt was as a result of credit cards (Tr at 54). I find that the record\nindicates that the majority of the debts listed on the SOR were actually for credit card\ndebt, rather than medical bills. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s husband has been unemployed\nsince May 2009, although Applicant does not attribute most of her financial difficulties to\nthat fact (Tr at 63). \nApplicant testified that on April 28, 2009, she and her husband consulted a\nCCCS advisor, but they were told that since the plan she and her husband had created\nput them seriously over their budget, they should try to reduce their debts by\nthemselves, over the next 90 days, and then they should return when they can consult\nwith the CCCS advisor (Tr at 55-57). In Exhibit S, Applicant indicated that she plans to\ndevelop a Debt Management Plan in the near future, but at this point she has not yet\ndone so.  Currently Applicant and her husband do not have any credit cards in an\nattempt to be more fiscally responsible. In Exhibit B, the records generated from\nApplicant\u2019s consultation with the CCCS, there is a budget created for Applicant and her\nhusband, which shows that after their expenses are deducted form their net income,\nthey have a net remainder of minus $230 a month. \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted two very positive character letters from co-workers (Exhibit\nA). Applicant is described as \u201cintelligent, capable, dedicated, and personable\u201d and \u201ca\nvaluable asset to [Applicant\u2019s] organization.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n    \n        The Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts. The guideline notes several conditions that could raise\nsecurity concerns. Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is\npotentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d may raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent\ndebt and has been unable to pay most of her obligations for a considerable period of\ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 there are certain conditions that can be considered mitigating.\nHowever, since Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties, and there was little\nevidence introduced to establish that Applicant has resolved most of these overdue\ndebts, plus a great deal of her debt is from overuse of credit cards, I do not find that any\nmitigating condition is applicable to minimize the Government\u2019s concern with Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial situation.  Based on Applicant\u2019s financial history and her current lack of a\nstable economic outlook, I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline F, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above regarding Applicant\u2019s history of overdue debts, her failure\nto resolve the majority of her debts, and her current tenuous financial situation, I find\nthat the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -.1.m., 1.o.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application, Standard Form 86, on May \n13, 2008. On December 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nOn January 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 23, 2009. On \nFebruary 6, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for February  \n26, 2009. The case was heard on that date. The Government offered three exhibits \nwhich were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 3. Applicant testified and \noffered one exhibit which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The record was \nheld open until March 12, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. No \nMarch 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadditional documents were submitted. The transcript was received on March 10, 2009.  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. He \nadmits the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.f.  \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old field engineer employed with a Department of Defense \ncontractor seeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his company since May \n2008. From August 1991 to November 2000, he served on active duty with the United \nStates Air Force. He separated at the rank of E-5 with an honorable discharge. He held \na security clearance from 1993 to 2006. He is married. He has two children from his \nsecond marriage, a daughter age 9, and a son age 8. His wife has four children. Two \nadult sons, a daughter, age 19 and a son, age 8. (Tr at 4-5, 14, 16-17; Gov 1.)  \n \nOn May 13, 2008, Applicant completed an electronic questionnaire for \ninvestigations processing (e-QIP), in order to apply for a security clearance. (Gov 1.) A \nsubsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had six delinquent \naccounts, an approximate total balance of $43,811.  The delinquent accounts included:  \na $163 medical debt placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 1); a $11,935 personal \nloan from a credit union that was charged off in September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 2 at \n1; Gov 3 at 8, 10); a $10,477 delinquent credit card account that was charged off in \nSeptember 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 5); a $4,105 personal loan from a \ncredit union that was charged off in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 1; Gov 3 at 10); \na $6,715 spousal support account that was placed for collection. (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at \n2; Gov 3 at 4); and a $10,416 personal loan with a bank that was charged off in July \n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 3 at 10). \n \nWhen he separated from the military, Applicant obtained a well paying job at an \noverseas location. He was able to meet all of his expenses. In November 2004, his wife \nat the time left Applicant and his children after encountering some legal trouble. She \nmoved back to the United States. She has not seen the children since. (Tr at 13, 16, 19-\n20, 32) \n \nIn May 2006, Applicant decided to leave his overseas job and move back to the \nUnited States. His children were being educated in the foreign country\u2019s educational \nsystem. He believed his children were not getting a proper education because they \nwere not being taught to read and write English. (Tr at 34-36) Applicant met his current \nwife while overseas. Applicant admits that part of his decision to move back to the \nUnited States was to be near and eventually marry his current wife. Upon moving back \nthe United States, Applicant and his children moved in with his current wife. She is an \nactive duty E-6 in the United States Navy. His divorce from his second wife was final in \nApril 2007.  He married his current wife in June 2007. (Tr at 17, 33 \u2013 34, 39) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after he moved back to the United States. \nHe was unemployed between May 2006 and July 2007. He found employment in July \n2007, but was laid off after six months in February 2008. He was unemployed for three \nmonths until he was hired in his current position in May 2008. (Tr at 36-38; Gov 1) \n \nIn his answer the SOR, Applicant indicates that both of his parents suffered from \nacute life threatening illnesses during the year he returned from the United States. It is \nnot clear whether this impacted his financial situation. Applicant did not testify about his \nparents\u2019 illnesses at hearing.  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s second wife moved back to the United States, she obtained a \nspousal support agreement in the local jurisdiction where she resides. Applicant was \nordered to pay $500 a month spousal support until the divorce was final. Applicant owes \napproximately $6,515 in arrearages. He made his first payment on December 5, 2008. \nHe intends to send monthly payments until the debt is resolved. The record was held \nopen, in part, to allow Applicant submit proof of additional monthly payments. (Tr at 21-\n22, 49-50) At the close of the record nothing was submitted.  \n \nWith respect to the medical debt is SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant denies knowledge of \nthis debt. It is a $163 medical debt which he believes his wife\u2019s military health insurance \nshould have paid. He tried to locate the medical facility where this debt was incurred but \nhas not been able to contact them. (Tr at 23-26) \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b -1.f remain outstanding. In May 2008, he \nentered into an agreement with a company who agreed to resolve and/or settle his \ndebts for him. He paid the company a couple thousand dollars up front and $375 \nmonthly. In February 2009, he terminated the agreement because they took his money \nbut were not paying on his delinquent accounts. The record was held open to allow \nApplicant to provide a copy of the agreement he made with the company and \ndocumentation of the payments made to the company. (Tr at 26-29) At the close of the \nrecord nothing was submitted.  \n  \nApplicant has not filed his federal income taxes since 2005. He claims he has not \nfiled because he is not familiar with the exact forms he needs. He believes he filed his \nfederal income tax returns for 2005. He has not filed federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2006 and 2007. He does not believe he owes any taxes. He anticipates refunds.  \nHe has not contacted the Internal Revenue Service. (Tr at 44-46) Applicant\u2019s income tax \nissues were not discovered until the hearing. Although not alleged in the SOR, \nApplicant\u2019s income tax issues are considered for determining whether or not any of the \nfinancial considerations mitigating conditions apply. (See ISCR App. Bd. Dec. 00-0633, \nOct. 24, 2003, at 3-4) \n \nApplicant intends to pay all of his debts. He has not attended financial \ncounseling. He does not maintain a monthly budget. He is apprehensive about seeking \nthe assistance of another debt solution company as a result of his recent experience. \n(Tr at 40-41, 50)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant and his wife live in different cities. She lives near the military installation \nwhere she is assigned on active duty. He lives in the area where he works. All of the \nchildren live with his wife. His wife is on terminal leave. Approximately 28 days after the \nhearing, she will separate from active duty. She and the children will move to where \nApplicant resides. She is interviewing for jobs in the area where Applicant resides but \nhas received no firm employment offers as of the date of the hearing. (Tr at 17-18) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Since 2006, Applicant accumulated \napproximately $43,811 in delinquent debt. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant continues to have financial problems. Although he made one payment \ntowards his past due spousal support payments, he provided no evidence that he is \nmaintaining his monthly payment even though the record was held open to allow him to \ndo so. The majority of his delinquent accounts remain unresolved.  In addition, it was \ndiscovered at hearing that Applicant has not filed income tax returns for 2006 and 2007. \nHe may owe income taxes for tax year 2005.  This raises further questions about his \njudgment and reliability.   \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s November \n2004 marital separation and divorce in April 2007, have had some impact on his \nfinancial situation. However, his decision to leave a well-paying job overseas prior to \nsecuring employment in the United States had the most adverse impact on Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfinancial situation. After his move, he was unemployed for over 14 months. Better \nplanning could have prevented this issue. Applicant testified that he was taken \nadvantage of by an unscrupulous debt resolution agency. However, I cannot consider \nthis fully without some corroborating evidence. The record was held open to allow \nApplicant to submit additional evidence, including a copy of the agreement he entered \ninto with the debt resolution company, and verification of the payments made to the \ncompany. Nothing was submitted. Most of Applicant\u2019s financial situation was the result \nof poor planning on his part as opposed to circumstances that were beyond his control.  \nFor these reasons, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight. He has no plan in place to \nresolve his delinquent accounts. It was also discovered at hearing that Applicant has \nsignificant tax problems. His financial problems have been aggravated as a result of \npoor planning and neglect. I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.   \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. While Applicant consulted a debt resolution company and \nentered into an agreement, he has not attended any formal financial counseling.  \nFinancial counseling would assist Applicant in controlling his finances. Although he \nmade one payment towards one of his debts, it is unlikely that his financial problems will \nbe resolved in the near future due to the extent of the delinquent debt.   \n  \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. One payment towards one of the \ndebts does not indicate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. While Applicant \nclaims he had entered into a contract with an unscrupulous debt resolution company, he \nprovided no evidence to corroborate his story even though he was given the opportunity \nto do so. Although Applicant promises to pay all of his debts off in the future, a promise \nto pay in the future does not mitigate the concerns under financial considerations.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s nine years \nof honorable service in the United States Air Force. I considered his marital issues over \nthe past five years. I considered his periods of unemployment. However, Applicant has \nnot demonstrated that he has taken sufficient action to resolve his delinquent accounts. \nThe government expects persons who are entrusted to access to classified information \nto fulfill their responsibilities as United States citizens. One of the more important \nresponsibilities is to file and pay taxes in a timely manner. It was discovered at hearing \nthat Applicant has federal tax issues for tax years 2005, 2006 and 2007. Concerns \nremain under financial considerations because of Applicant\u2019s failure to uphold his duty \nto file and pay federal income taxes as well as his unresolved financial problems. A \nsecurity risk remains because of Applicant\u2019s history of financial irresponsibility and the \nlack of action taken towards resolving his delinquent accounts. He has not met his \nburden to mitigate the concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She holds a security clearance for her duties, which includes estimating funds and employee work hours (Ex. 1, Tr. 91). After fewer than four years of marriage, Applicant was granted a divorce from her first husband in May 1989 (Exs. 1, M). Applicant was adjudged responsible for the debts in her name, including a $1,500 credit union debt and a $900 MasterCard debt (Ex. M). Applicant remarried in May 1990. Following the death of her father in September 1998, Applicant took her mother into her home. Applicant\u2019s mother had significant health problems, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and cancer.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant fell behind on several consumer credit card accounts before 2006\nwhen she had to maintain a household on her income as a bookkeeper. Since her\ndivorce in June 2005, she has paid an unexpected $10,000 federal tax debt and\nsatisfied two of her delinquent consumer credit accounts. She has retained a law firm to\ninvestigate her responsibility for the remaining debt on her credit record, and she\nintends to resolve those debts that are verified. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 15, 2008. On February 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its preliminary decision\nto deny her a security clearance and to refer the matter to an administrative judge. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\nNovember 27, 2009\n\nThere was no \u00b6 1.n alleged in the SOR.\n1\n2\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn March 16, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and indicated that she did not\nwant a hearing. She subsequently elected a hearing and the case was assigned to me\non May 15, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to determine whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On\nJune 2, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for July 2, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Four government exhibits (Ex. 1-4) and 13\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-M) were admitted without any objections. Applicant also\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 10, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owed\n14 delinquent debts totaling $42,649 (SOR 1.a-1.m and 1.o)  as of June 2008. In her\n1\nAnswer, Applicant admitted only the debt in SOR 1.i, which she had settled. She\nindicated she had retained a law firm to investigate the validity of the other alleged\ndebts, and she would resolve those determined to be legally valid. After considering the\npleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old office manager who has worked for her present\nemployer, a defense contractor, since late April 2008. She holds a security clearance for\nher duties, which includes estimating funds and employee work hours (Ex. 1, Tr. 91).\nAfter fewer than four years of marriage, Applicant was granted a divorce from her\nfirst husband in May 1989 (Exs. 1, M). Applicant was adjudged responsible for the debts\nin her name, including a $1,500 credit union debt and a $900 MasterCard debt (Ex. M).\nApplicant remarried in May 1990. Following the death of her father in September 1998,\nApplicant took her mother into her home. Applicant\u2019s mother had significant health\nproblems, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and cancer. Her mother incurred medical costs\nthat were not covered by Medicare. At one point, Applicant paid about $600 per month\nin prescription drug costs for her mother (Tr. 39) on her salary as a bookkeeper. From\nMarch 2000 to February 2002, Applicant worked as a bookkeeper full-time for one\ncompany and part-time for another (Ex. 1).\nAround 2002, Applicant\u2019s spouse moved to a nearby state to start a business\nwith his father (Ex. 1). Applicant could not join him because of her mother\u2019s illness.\nApplicant found it difficult to pay her and her mother\u2019s living expenses from her salary as\na bookkeeper. She obtained consumer credit counseling in 2002/03 for assistance in\npaying off credit card debt through a debt consolidation plan (Tr. 126-27). She paid\nabout $500 a month to the debt resolution firm for three or four months (Tr. 127), which\nwent mostly for fees (Tr. 128). She had to discontinue her debt repayment plan because\nshe could not afford the monthly payments (Tr. 141). After her mother died in early\n\nApplicant testified that she located her ex-husband about four to six months after they separated.\n2\nAfter she told him about the debt, he had his phone disconnected (Tr. 106-07).\n3\nOctober 2003 (Ex. A), Applicant assumed responsibility for repaying medical costs\nincurred by her mother that were not covered by Medicare (Ex. 1, Tr. 35, 116-17).\nAvailable Medicare summaries indicate Applicant\u2019s mother incurred about $2,200 in\nnon-covered institutional and professional provider medical costs in 2003 (Ex. A).\nApplicant listed her home for sale on the death of her mother, and it eventually\nsold in the spring of 2004. In March 2004, Applicant relocated to be with her spouse.\nShe found work as a bookkeeper. Her spouse\u2019s business started failing (Tr. 129), and in\nOctober 2004, Applicant took on a second job as a part-time cashier in the layaway\ndepartment of a discount retail department store (Ex. 1). She worked about 70 hours\nper week in an effort to cover their expenses (Tr. 93), but debts continued to\naccumulate (Tr. 129).\nApplicant\u2019s marriage failed, and in their June 2005 divorce, she and her ex-\nspouse were held solely responsible for the debts incurred in their respective names.\nApplicant retained a 1997 model-year vehicle that was free of any encumbrance. Her\nspouse retained several vehicles, including two with outstanding loan balances (SOR\n1.d and 1.m) (Ex. L).\nJust before her divorce was final, Applicant relocated to her present locale,\nwhere she moved in with her sister and sister\u2019s husband (Ex. 1, Tr. 36). Applicant\nworked full-time as a bookkeeper for a marine company for a few months at an annual\nsalary of about $40,000 while continuing part-time duties for her previous employer via\nVPN out of her new home (Tr. 95, 138). In July 2005, she began employment as a full-\ntime office manager for a defense contractor at an annual salary of $43,000 (Ex. 138).\nIn September 2005, her part-time work for her former employer ended (Ex.1). \nIn July 2006, Applicant financed the purchase of a used vehicle, taking out a loan\nof $14,638 (Ex. 2). She has made her loan payments on time (Ex. 2, Tr. 98). In about\nNovember 2006, Applicant was notified by the Internal Revenue Service that she and\nher former spouse owed about $10,042.41 in federal tax debt for tax year 2004 (Exs. 1,\nB) due to a late report of income for her former spouse (Tr. 104). Applicant took sole\nresponsibility for repaying the tax debt.  She made monthly payments from November\n2\n2006 until October 2007, when she made a lump sum payment of $6,000. She\nborrowed the sum from her brother-in-law so that she could satisfy the IRS and avoid\nfuture interest and penalty charges. As of December 2007, she had paid her delinquent\nfederal tax obligation in full. Between October 2007 and September 2008, Applicant\npaid her brother-in-law $500 per month to satisfy her personal loan with him (Ex. B, Tr.\n36, 104-06).\nIn late April 2008, Applicant started her current job at an annual salary of about\n$58,000 (Tr. 138). She also stayed on with her previous employer part-time through\nJune 2008, helping to close the office location where she had worked (Ex. 1, Tr. 91-92).\nNeeding a security clearance for her new employer, Applicant executed an e-QIP on\n\n4\nMay 15, 2008. She responded affirmatively to question 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have\nyou been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and listed the IRS debt and 15\nother debts that were listed on a May 8, 2008, credit report. She denied any knowledge\nabout the debts on her credit record with the exception of two vehicle loans (SOR 1.d\nand 1.m) that were to be paid by her ex-husband after their divorce. Applicant indicated\nthat after she finished repaying her sister and brother-in-law for the money loaned to her\nto satisfy the IRS, she intended to begin paying off the outstanding debt that could be\nverified (Ex. 1).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 3, 2008, revealed several delinquent\naccounts (Ex. 2). In July 2008, Applicant met with a government investigator about the\ndebts. She made no payments at that time because she was repaying her sister and\nbrother-in-law for the money loaned to her to pay the IRS debt (Tr. 114-15). In\nNovember 2008, Applicant paid $750 to settle the debt in SOR 1.j (Ex. C). She\nsubsequently obtained a credit report and was confused by multiple listings for several\naccounts. On March 10, 2009, Applicant retained the services of a law firm to verify her\ndebts and dispute them where appropriate (Ex. K, Tr. 107). She paid an initial retainer\nfee of $99 and then $79 per month for its services (Tr. 102). Applicant was advised to\nmake no payments on her debts pending verification. The financial histories of those\ndebts in the SOR and a flooring debt not alleged are set forth in the following table.\nDebt as alleged in SOR\nDelinquency history\nStatus as of July 09\n1.a. $1,114 credit card\ndebt \nHigh credit $1,023, past\ndue as of Feb. 04, $1,114\nbalance as of May 08,\ndisputed Mar. 09 (Ex.

Her monthly\nobligations include $500 in rent to her sister, $100 towards the cable television costs,\n$282 for her car payment and $100 to $150 in cellular telephone services (Tr. 97-99).\nHer vehicle insurance is $900 a year (Tr. 97-98). As of July 2009, she was current in her\nliving expenses and had been \u201cbanking\u201d about $1,000 each month for the past four\nmonths in a money market account that she planned to put toward her old debts. She\nintends to continue to set aside at least $1,000 each month, pending verification of her\ndebts, and then to make lump sum payments of the verified debts (Tr. 100-02, 131).\nApplicant had an additional $1,000 in checking account funds that she had planned on\ndepositing into her money market account. She had to use the money for car repairs in\nlate June 2009 (Tr. 145).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\n\n7\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\nW hether or not Applicant sought out the medical care covered in SOR 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, such\n4\nexpenses are not considered discretionary.\n8\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant incurred in her name, and in some cases jointly with her then spouse,\ncredit card and personal loan debt during her second marriage that she was not able to\nrepay after he relocated to start a business with his father. Neither she nor her spouse\nmade payments on two joint car loans that fell delinquent in the respective amounts of\n$6,168 (SOR 1.d, duplicated in 1.i) and $11,203 (SOR 1.m), or on a loan for a\nmotorcycle that she bought in her name (SOR 1.j). Three of her medical debts totaling\n$881 (SOR 1.f-1.h) and several non-vehicle consumer credit debts totaling about\n$11,690 were charged off or referred for collection (SOR 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.k, and 1.l). AG \u00b6\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d applies. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d is also implicated to the extent that she did not have the\nfunds to make timely payments on those obligations.\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation, there are no accounts that have\nrecently fallen delinquent. Most of the debts became past due in or before 2005. Yet,\nwith limited exception, they have not been resolved. Under the circumstances, AG \u00b6\n20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nHowever, the evidence supports application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstance.\u201d Although\nmost of the debts were incurred voluntarily,  Applicant\u2019s ability to remain current in her\n4\nobligations was negatively affected by the failure of her spouse\u2019s business, which was\noutside of her control. She fell further behind despite working a second job for the\nadditional income to pay expenses. Applicant also had to cover some $2,000 in medical\nexpenses of her mother\u2019s after her mother died. Then, after she acquired defense\ncontractor employment, she was notified by the IRS that she and her ex-spouse owed a\njoint tax debt of about $10,000 for tax year 2004. She was forced to pay the obligation\nherself with no help from her ex-spouse. After several months of payments, she\nborrowed $6,000 from her sister and brother-in-law so that she could satisfy the debt\nand avoid further fees in interest and penalties. I cannot find that Applicant was\nfinancially irresponsible in repaying that personal loan before her collection debts, in\nlight of her dependence on her sister for her living quarters and her lack of full\nawareness of her debt situation. She obtained a credit report in May 2008 which\ncontained multiple entries for some accounts. Of the several debts on her credit record,\nApplicant recognized only two automobile loans, and they were supposed to be paid by\nher ex-spouse following their divorce.\n\n9\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d is implicated in part. Available evidence indicates that SOR \u00b6 1.e is an updated\ncollection balance for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. Similarly, SOR \u00b6 1.d is an updated balance\nof the $6,168 charge off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. So, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.o are not additional\ndebt balances. Furthermore, with respect to the automobile loans in SOR \u00b6 1.d and 1.m,\nher ex-spouse agreed to take responsibility for the car loans that were outstanding as of\ntheir divorce. Irrespective of whether the creditors hold her liable for the balances, her\nfailure to make payments on those debts after June 2005 is extenuated. Her ex-spouse\ntook physical control of the vehicles, and she had no reason to know that he was not\nmaking his payments. \nAs for efforts to repay debts, Applicant attempted to resolve some debts with the\nassistance of a consumer credit counseling services firm in 2003/04, but she made only\nthree or four months of $500 payments that went toward fees. Within the past year,\nApplicant paid $100 to satisfy in full the medical debt in SOR 1.f, and $750 to settle the\n$3,771 motorcycle installment loan in SOR 1.j. She otherwise made no payments\ntoward her other delinquent debts, including SOR 1.a, which had been validated by\nEquifax as of April 16, 2009 (Ex. J). However, she retained the services of a law firm to\ninvestigate the debts and determine her liability, if any, for the balances. She saved\nabout $4,000 in an account that she planned to put toward those debts that are her\nlegal responsibility. Apart from being advised to refrain from making payments on her\ndebts pending their verification, there is no evidence of any financial advice or\ncounseling. Since most of her debts have yet to be resolved, it is premature to apply AG\n\u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d\nIn her favor, Applicant has demonstrated a credible intent to resolve her debts by\nsettling the motorcycle loan in November 2008 before the SOR was issued, and by\nobtaining professional assistance to rectify her financial situation within days of\nreceiving the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiate a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies. She has demonstrated recent\nfinancial responsibility as well in making timely payments on her living expenses and in\nnot incurring any new delinquent debt.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n10\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant took on financial obligations during her second marriage that she could\nnot repay when she was placed in a situation of having to provide for herself and her\nailing mother on her salary as a bookkeeper. After her mother died and she joined her\nspouse, she worked two jobs, about 70 hours per week, but it was still not enough to\nsatisfy both their daily living expenses and their overdue credit obligations. Since her\ndivorce in 2005, her income has increased substantially to where she is now earning\nabout $60,000 annually. However, an unforeseen $10,000 federal income tax obligation\nprevented her from taking timely efforts to address her old consumer credit debts.\nAvailable credit information reflects outstanding balances totaling from about $15,000\n(including the flooring debt in collection that was not alleged) to almost $35,000 if she is\nheld responsible for the two car loans. But nothing in the Directive requires that an\napplicant be debt free before she can be granted access.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person\nanalysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of\nlaw, to establish that [she] has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is\nrequired is that an applicant demonstrate that [she] has \u2018 . . . established a plan to\nresolve [her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant intends to repay those debts that are verified, and she is currently setting\naside about $1,000 per month to pay off the debts. She has retained the services of a\nlaw firm for assistance in resolving her debts. Moreover, she has lived within her means\nsince 2005, electing to reside with her sister at a lower cost so that she will have the\nfinancial assets to address her debts. Since most of the debts have not been paid, the\nrisk of financial pressure must be considered. Applicant has worked two jobs in the past,\nwhen financially necessary. She is seen as unlikely to succumb to financial pressures to\nresolve her delinquent debts.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 17, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on December 20, 2007 (Government Exhibit 1).  On November 10, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by\nPresident Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on December 1, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on January 5, 2009.  I received the case assignment on January 7, 2009.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 17, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on March 24, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through\n\n2\n6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf,  and\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through L, which were received without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing on April 16, 2009.  The record closed on\nthat date. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 38 and single.  She has been offered employment by a defense\ncontractor, and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with this proposed\nemployment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because she is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations in\nthis paragraph of the SOR. \nThe Applicant submits that the majority of her financial problems began when\nshe left a well-paying job in 2005 to take a job with a start-up company that collapsed\nsoon after she was employed there.  She has not been fully employed since that time.\n(Transcript at 38-40.) \nThe Applicant repeatedly stated that her desire is to pay off all of her debts.  She\npresented a spread-sheet with projections on how she would pay off the debt based on\nher possible income.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)  In all situations it would take at least three\nyears to pay all the debts back, and presumes that she has the job that was offered to\nher by the defense contractor.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and C; Transcript at 27-34.)  It is\nalso worthwhile to note that, until the 2007-2008 school year, the Applicant\u2019s child\nattended private schools.  After she lost her job at the start-up, the Applicant used credit\ncards to continue to pay for the tuition.  (Transcript at 35-37.)  \n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to American Express in the\namount of $14,000.00.  The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and\nhas no current plans to make payments on this debt.  (Transcript at 24-26.)    \n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to AMS-SG in the amount of\n$1,596.00.  This is a student loan that went delinquent.  The Applicant has made no\nrecent payments on this debt, and has no current plans to make payments on this debt.\n(Transcript at 24.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Chase in the amount of\n$23,000.00.  The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and has no\ncurrent plans to make payments on this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)    \n\n3\n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that she is indebted to Citi in the amount of\n$19,000.00.  The Applicant has made no recent payments on this debt, and has no\ncurrent plans to make payments on this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.)\n1.e.\nThe Applicant admits that she was indebted to Time/Warner Cable in the\namount of $251.00.  That debt has been paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B; Transcript at\n23.)\nMitigation\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit E is a letter from the Applicant\u2019s boyfriend.  He states that he\nis helping the Applicant financially, and that they are in a committed relationship.  From\nthat I assume that he will be willing and able to continue to assist her.\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits F through L are personal and professional references.\nThese people, who include past employers as well as respected business people in her\ncommunity, all state that the Applicant is a truthful and trustworthy person.  They\nrecommend her for a position of trust.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by her own admission, has over $57,000.00 in past\ndue debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2005 and 2007.  However, she does\nnot have a reasonable plan to pay the past due indebtedness.  Her plans depend on\ncertain actions happening over which the Applicant has no control.  An earnest desire to\npay debts is not a reasonable substitute for action.  The Applicant has paid a $251.00\nbill out of a total indebtedness of over $57,000.00.  It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit\nevidence showing that her financial situation has improved.  She has not done so.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  The Applicant took a chance and left a good paying job for one with a\nstart-up company.  She then compounded the debt by using credit cards to pay for her\ndaughter\u2019s school tuition at a time when the Applicant did not have full-time\nemployment.  With the available record, I cannot find, under these particular facts, that\nthe Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances.\nThe Applicant has barely initiated a good-faith effort to pay off her creditors.\nBecause she paid the debt, subparagraph 1.e. is found for the Applicant.  There is no\ntrack record of her making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6\n20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that she is $57,000.00 in debt, I cannot\nfind that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a respected person\n\n6\nwho is under financial strain, and has been for several years.  She has not made a\nsufficient showing that her debt situation is under control.  Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find that there\nhave been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly, at the\npresent time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)), or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nconsiderations at this time.  If she can resolve her debt situation in a reasonable\nfashion, she may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  She is not eligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly,\nthe evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e:\nFor  the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is legally separated, pending divorce, and has an adult son and a 20-year-old daughter attending college. In his answer to the SOR, he denied all allegations. At the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel formally withdrew the Guideline E allegation against Applicant because it was improperly charged. (Tr. at 4, 46.) Applicant had been working in healthcare management for 17 or 18 years when he agreed to a one-year contract in the early 1990s to manage operations at a medical clinic. The clinic had been closed by the county for providing substandard care. The owners of this clinic were four attorneys from a distant major city. Applicant corrected the problems and reopened the clinic in about six months. He spent the remaining six months of his contract managing the ongoing operation while a full time administrator was recruited and hired. He left the position at the end of the one year contract.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nAfter the owners and financial manager of a medical clinic, where Applicant\nworked as the operations manager for one year in the early 1990s, failed to make\npayroll tax deposits, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed tax liens against all the\nowners and managers, including him. He was advised by counsel that the he did not\nowe any debt to the IRS and should not pay his former employers\u2019 tax obligation. The\nIRS never contacted him seeking payment, and has refunded income taxes to him since\nthen. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on July 22, 2008. On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nApril 28, 2009\n\n2\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 26,\n2008. He answered the SOR in writing on December 1, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\nJanuary 5, 2009, and DOHA assigned the case to me on the following day.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 4, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on February 24, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf, and offered no Applicant\u2019s Exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on March 4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 68-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where he has worked\nfor one year as a truck driver. He is legally separated, pending divorce, and has an adult\nson and a 20-year-old daughter attending college. In his answer to the SOR, he denied\nall allegations. At the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel formally withdrew\nthe Guideline E allegation against Applicant because it was improperly charged. (Tr. at\n4, 46.)\nApplicant had been working in healthcare management for 17 or 18 years when\nhe agreed to a one-year contract in the early 1990s to manage operations at a medical\nclinic. The clinic had been closed by the county for providing substandard care. The\nowners of this clinic were four attorneys from a distant major city. Applicant corrected\nthe problems and reopened the clinic in about six months. He spent the remaining six\nmonths of his contract managing the ongoing operation while a full time administrator\nwas recruited and hired. He left the position at the end of the one year contract. (Tr. at\n28-30.)\nThe owners of the clinic encountered some serious financial difficulties and their\nfinancial manager, located in the lead attorney\u2019s office, failed to make timely deposits of\npayroll taxes that were withheld from the clinic\u2019s employees\u2019 pay. Applicant had no\nresponsibility for handling the clinic\u2019s finances, and had no knowledge of these problems\nat the time. When the IRS discovered the failure to make the required deposits, they\nfiled a demand for payment of $32,923.63, that included a 100% penalty. Identical\ndemands for the entire amount, and associated tax liens, were filed against all\nadministrative employees of the facility, including Applicant. Liens were also filed\nagainst each of the four attorneys, the local representative of their partnership, the\naccountant, the bookkeeper, and the director of nursing services, who also had no\ninvolvement with the financial aspects of clinic operations. Applicant found out about the\nproblem when the IRS notified him of the filing of their collection action and lien, some\nthree or four months after he left that job. (Tr. at 29-32.)\n\n3\nApplicant did not have sufficient funds to personally pay the demand and satisfy\nthe lien, nor did he consider it to be legitimately his personal debt. He consulted an\nattorney who agreed to handle the matter for him. The attorney filed some papers for\nhim, and later advised him that the issue was resolved and he need not worry about any\nproperty or tax refunds being attached, or other collection action being taken. He was\nadvised that the lien could remain on credit reports for some time, however. Over the\npast 15 years, the IRS has never contacted Applicant concerning this lien or the\nunderlying debt, nor have they filed a lien against any of his property including the home\nhe owns with his wife. He has filed all of his annual income tax returns, and when due a\nrefund the IRS has paid it to him. He has never been denied credit as a result of this\nlien, including a 2003 first mortgage and a 2008 second mortgage on his home. (Tr. at\n33-36; GE 6 at 2.)\nApplicant has more than sufficient income to meet his regular living expenses,\nand continues to provide financial assistance to his daughter in college. He is current on\nall debt payments, and has never had an account placed for collection or charged off.\n(Tr. at 25-26.) The tax lien appeared as a Trans Union entry on Applicant\u2019s July 29,\n2008 full data credit report (covering all three major reporting agencies). (GE 4 at 3.) It\ndoes not appear on either of his subsequently obtained Equifax credit reports dated\nOctober 3, 2008, and February 19, 2009. (GE 5 and 6.) Based on all the evidence of\nrecord in this case, I find as a fact that the tax lien recorded against Applicant in July\n1993 does not represent a debt that he owes. I further find that Applicant\u2019s testimony\nand demeanor throughout his hearing were entirely forthright and credible. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\n\n4\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted the applicability of two of these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d (Tr. at 13-14.) One other disqualifying condition\ncould also be implicated by the existence of a tax lien: \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal,\nstate, or local income tax returns as required, or fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d Applicant\n\n5\nadmitted the existence of the tax lien, but it does not correspond to any debt that he\nlegally owes. The undisputed evidence demonstrated Applicant\u2019s ability and willingness\nto satisfy all of his debts, so no security concerns arise under AG \u00b6 19(a). The evidence\nalso failed to establish any history of not meeting financial obligations that might support\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c). Finally, the lien did not result from any personal\nfailure by Applicant to comply with his Federal tax obligations and was unrelated to his\nincome taxes. Accordingly, no security concerns arise under AG \u00b6 19(g). The evidence\nof record raises no questions about Applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and willingness\nto abide by rules and regulations under which people are expected to fulfill their lawful\nobligations.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns should any be\nfound to arise from the mere existence of this tax lien, independent of any legitimate\ndebt. The two applicable conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nAG \u00b6 20(a) supports mitigation because the lien was filed more than 15 years\nago, and there has been no effort by the IRS to pursue any collection action in\nconnection therewith. It arose under unique circumstances entirely unrelated to\nApplicant\u2019s present employment or living circumstances. Applicant had neither\ninvolvement in nor responsibility for the failure to deposit payroll tax withholdings that\ncaused the lien to be filed, so it supports no doubt at all about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) also applies since the lien resulted from\nevents of which he had no knowledge. Once he learned of the problem, he followed the\nadvice of a tax attorney, who helped absolve him of any underlying debt obligation, but\ncould not prevent its presence on one of the three credit bureau reports. \n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves the presence of a 15-year-old Federal tax lien on his Trans Union\ncredit report. This lien does not correspond to any underlying personal tax obligation on\nhis part, and arose due to actions of others about which he had no knowledge. This\none-time incident, viewed in context of his life-long record of meeting his financial\nobligations, creates no potential for pressure, coercion or duress. The unique\ncircumstances under which the lien arose make recurrence most unlikely.\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate any\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness security concerns arising from the appearance of\nthis tax lien on one of his credit reports. His willingness and ability to satisfy his debts,\nand his history of consistently meeting his financial and tax-related obligations are\nclearly established. The record evidence leaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has\nmitigated security concerns related to his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted\n                                  \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn May 5, 2008, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86). \nOn October 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 6, 2008. He answered \nthe SOR in writing after that date, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on November 19, 2008. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on January 14, 2009, and I received the case assignment that \nsame day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on January 21, 2009, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on February 3, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A \nthrough Q, without objection. I gave him permission to submit other exhibits after the \nhearing, and he submitted one document without objection by Department Counsel, \nwhich I then marked as Exhibit R. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nFebruary 11, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice within 13 days \nof the hearing date. (Tr. at 7.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the \nDirective to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant was given notice by telephone \nby the Department Counsel on January 21, 2009, of the hearing date.  Applicant \naffirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice, and agreed to proceed with the hearing \nas scheduled. (Tr. at 8.)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.b \nthrough 1.l of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.a of \nthe SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for \na security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old, unmarried, and works as a security guard for a defense \ncontractor at an hourly wage of $10.42 per hour.  He has a part-time job which pays him \n$9.00 per hour, totaling about $145 weekly.  Applicant\u2019s net monthly income is $1,277 \nfrom his primary job.  His part-time job should net him about $600 monthly.  His VA \ndisability payment adds $114 to the total net income.  Therefore, his total net income is \n$1,991. His total monthly expenses are $1,349.79.  The difference is $642, which he \nwants to use to pay his debts.  He owns his house (and has since 1986) and his car.  \nHe has a first mortgage on his house.  He was discharged from the Army in 1983 with a \ndisability, and receives $114 per month from the Veterans Administration (VA) for \ndisability.  He relies on the VA for his medical care.  Some months the costs of \nmedicines and other services result in the VA keeping his disability payment to cover \nthose costs. (Tr. 21-28, 65, 66, 80; Exhibits 1, O, P)  \n \n \nBefore August 2001, Applicant had excellent credit and his debts were paid \nregularly.  His girlfriend, with whom he lived for 17 years, departed their jointly-owned \nhome three weeks after he refinanced his mortgage in August 2001.  She was disabled \nand received disability payments.  If they were married, she would have had the \npayments reduced or eliminated.  That dual income helped Applicant afford his home \nand other purchases during the 17-year relationship.  Before she left him, Applicant\u2019s \ngirlfriend incurred about $4,551 in new debts, which she has refused to pay  He wanted \nher to sign a Quit Claim deed for whatever legal interest in the home she may have, but \n\n \n3 \n \n \nshe refused to do so.  The proposed deed shows her as having a joint tenancy with \nrights of survivorship in the property.  Later, in December 2001, she filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy.  In February 2002, he sued her in small claims court for the money she \nowed him for the debts she incurred in his name and using his credit.  His lawsuit was \ndismissed after the bankruptcy stay became effective.  His former girlfriend has never \npaid him for these debts.  If she were to sign the Quit Claim deed, he would refinance \nthe house again, as he planned to do, and use any equity to repay his debts. (Tr. 30-32, \n35, 75, 80, 83; Exhibits 1-4, A-H) \n \n \nApplicant has 12 delinquent debts totaling about $21,674, listed on the SOR..  \nHis latest credit report shows $13,241 in debt.  (Tr. 60) \n \n \nApplicant denied he owed $5,000 to creditors as set forth in subparagraph 1.a of \nthe SOR. His former girlfriend\u2019s parents sued both of them to recover a loan they \nallegedly made to Applicant and their daughter.  Applicant thought at the time it was a \ngift to both of them.  After their relationship broke apart, he learned her parents \nconsidered it a loan because he signed a promissory note for the amount.  Applicant \nclaims he only would owe half the amount, $2,500, because his former girlfriend owes \nthe other half.  The father has since died, and the judgment remains unpaid. (Tr. 41-43; \nExhibits 2-4, I) \n \n \nApplicant owes $1,938 to a dentist for major dental work done in December 2006 \n(subparagraph 1.b).  He has an installment payment agreement for $20 monthly on the \ndebt.  The dentist filed a small claims lawsuit against Applicant, which he settled with \nthe agreement.  Applicant had already paid $1,500 on that debt until he was not able to \nmake further payments 10 months earlier. (Tr. 43-45; Exhibits 2-4, A, R) \n \n \nThe $2,449 owed on a department store credit card was incurred by Applicant\u2019s \nformer girlfriend in 2001 (subparagraph 1.c).  He has not paid that debt.  He never used \nthe credit card. (Tr. 45, 46; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant owes $147 to a collector.  He does not know the basis of the debt.  He \nhas not paid it (subparagraph 1.d).  (Tr. 46, 47; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nThe delinquent debt set forth in subparagraph 1.e. is for $280 owed to a bank.  \nApplicant owed this debt since July 2003.  Applicant intends to repay this debt, the \nprevious listed debt, and the next two listed debts from the money he earns at his part-\ntime employment. (Tr. 47, 48; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant owes $513 on a credit card (subparagraph 1.f).  He tried to work out a \npayment plan with this creditor, but the company wanted the entire amount paid at one \ntime. (Tr. 50; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant owes $242 on a gasoline credit card (subparagraph 1.g).  He does not \nhave the income at present to pay this debt. (Tr. 51; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant owed $626 on his mortgage payment, but he has brought this account \ncurrent in February 2009 (subparagraph 1.h).  He was one month behind in his \npayments.  He signed a note to cure the attempted foreclosure last year, pursuant to the \nHOPE program with his bank.  He is paying the $2,300 in arrearages on an installment \npayment agreement at $18 monthly.  His new part-time employment income helped him \nbecome current on his payments. (Tr. 51-54, 64, 65; Exhibits 2-4, A, B, C, L, O) \n \n \nThe next debt for $1,341 is owed to a bank for a loan taken out in 2001 \n(subparagraph 1.i).  It became delinquent in 2003.  Applicant understood the debt was \ncharged off by the bank, and thought the bank meant he did not have to repay it.  It \ncontinues to show as a delinquent debt on his credit reports.  He has not repaid the \ndebt. (Tr. 55, 56; Exhibits 2-4, A) \n \n \nApplicant owes a jeweler $1,615 for an engagement ring and a watch he \npurchased (subparagraph 1.j).  Applicant has not made payments on it for a long time.  \nHe bought the engagement ring for his second girlfriend, with whom he lived from 2002 \nto 2006.  She also had her three children living in Applicant\u2019s house.  Applicant was \nsupporting her and her children, the expenses for which deprived Applicant of money \nwith which to pay his debts.  The girlfriend, according to Applicant, was an alcoholic, \nand her family damaged his house before they departed, necessitating him spending \nmoney to repair the damage. (Tr. 56-58; Exhibits 2-4, A) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s next debt for $70 is owed to a collector (subparagraph 1.k).  Applicant \ndoes not recall this debt.  He would pay it if he had the income to do so. (Tr. 58; Exhibits \n2-4) \n \n \nThe final debt listed in the SOR (subparagraph 1.l) for $7,453 is owed to a bank \non a credit card he and his first girlfriend had.  He was trying to refinance his home in \n2001 to repay this debt when his girlfriend left him.  This debt is unpaid. (Tr. 58, 59; \nExhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant pays his monthly bills on time.  His tax returns are filed on time and the \ntaxes paid with the returns.  He submitted evidence of his regular monthly payments.  \nHe also pays on a wireless telephone service he had with his third girlfriend and her \ndaughter.  He got them phones, which he has recovered, but cannot cancel the service \nbecause of the cancellation fee.  Therefore, he continues to pay the monthly rate while \nnot using the phones. That relationship lasted from July 2007 to October 2007.  \nApplicant currently lives alone. (Tr. 59-68; Exhibits N and O) \n \n \nApplicant has several periods of unemployment, but has always worked hard to \nfind replacement employment.  In November 2001 he was unemployed for a short time.  \nIn February 2003 he lost his job, and then found another job.  All his jobs were working \nat hourly rates in security officer positions.  In May 2006 he had a heart attack.  He was \nunemployed in October 2007, and got another job in December 2007.  In October 2008 \nhe got his part-time job, but was laid off it in December 2008.  He has been reemployed \n\n \n5 \n \n \nwith that company only recently. Applicant does not have any savings, living from \npaycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 38, 39, 59-68; Exhibits A, N, O) \n \n \nApplicant submitted character statements from his former employer in 1994 \nabout his work product.  He also submitted a 1995 character statement from a \nsupervisor, and an undated statement.  Applicant submitted a local newspaper article \nabout a security officer at the city airport greeting people, and claims he was the person \nabout whom the article was written.  Finally, he submitted a 2002 promotion letter of his \nwhen he became a sergeant in the local police reserves.  He worked in the police \nreserve forces from 1994 to 2008, hoping to get a full-time job as a policeman.  He was \nnever able to get on the police force. (Tr. 35-37; Exhibit Q)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n6 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt from 2001 to 2007, and has \nbeen unable to pay most of the obligations for several years. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concern. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising under this guideline. \n  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant=s financial worries \nstarted in 2001. He accumulated delinquent debt when his long-time girlfriend took \nadvantage of him, charged purchases and cash advances in the amount of $4,551.16.  \nApplicant attempted to sue her to recover this amount, but she filed bankruptcy to \nprevent him from recovering money to repay these debts.  The debts incurred after his \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsuccessive two relationships were at least two years ago.  He has not paid for the \nengagement ring and watch from the second relationship, but he is paying for the \ntelephones leased during the third and last relationship.  He is paying his current debts, \nalthough he is sometimes delinquent with his mortgage payments.  He is current on \nthem because of the HOPE program and his personal initiative to keep his home he has \nhad for the past 23 years.  These circumstances with his girlfriends are no longer \nextant. I find the behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances with these \nrelationships which caused Applicant to spend money he could have used for debt \nrepayment that it is unlikely to recur because he has learned to avoid such situations, \nand they do not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \n  \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of \nthe financial problems arose from his failed personal relationships, akin to a divorce in \nthe first and second situations, and a separation in the third relationship. His periods of \nunemployment in 2001, 2003, and 2007 were minimal because he worked hard to \nobtain new employment immediately.  His heart attack in May 2006 lost him some work \ntime and income.  For all these reasons, I find this potentially mitigating condition is a \nfactor for consideration in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c).  There is no evidence of counseling \nsubmitted by Applicant, and it is not a factor to be considered.  Applicant does \nrecognize his financial obligations and tries, within the limits of his income, to meet \nthose obligations. \n \nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nresolved two of the delinquent debts, his dental bill and his mortgage arrearages, by \ninstallment payment plans. The remaining debts he is unable to repay because he \ncannot refinance his house without the Quit Claim deed from his first girlfriend using that \nmoney to repay the debts.  Or he does not have sufficient income monthly to repay the \ndebts and continue to pay his mortgage and regular monthly obligations. I conclude this \npotentially mitigating condition applies partially because of the efforts Applicant made on \ntwo debts, and his sincere desire and credible assertion to pay the remaining debts from \nhis income.  His part-time job provides him with additional income to repay the six \nsmaller debts first, then the next five debts in ascending order of magnitude, leaving the \njudgment from his girlfriend\u2019s parents to be paid last at half the amount sought, because \nshe owes the other half to her parents.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nFinally, AG & 20(e) concerning affluence from a legal source is not a factor in this \ncase.  Applicant lives from pay check to pay check, and has no affluence he needs to \nexplain.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts are a \nserious problem.  But he has worked continuously for many years, and not been idle \nabout his financial obligations. He had good credit before 2001.  He made poor \ndecisions about his personal relationships in three situations, but that became obvious \nonly in hindsight.  He has always paid his mortgage, or caught up on the payments as \nquickly as possible.  He has diligently sought second jobs to supplement his primary \nincome.  His hourly wage security positions do not pay him enough to make his monthly \nfinancial obligations, and repay debts incurred during his relationships.  \n \n His first girlfriend left him with substantial debts when she secretly charged credit \ncards and took cash advances. Then she tied his hands financially by refusing to \nrelease any interest in his house which she might have after their 17-year relationship \nended. She lived in the house with him for 17 years, and apparently has a joint tenancy \ninterest in the property with survivorship rights, according to the Quit Claim Deed.)   \n \nApplicant has not incurred new long-term debt, and lives very simply.  The \ndelinquent debts were incurred from 2001 to 2006. The last debt he incurred, which \nremains unpaid, was for the engagement ring in 2006.   \n \nApplicant acts responsibly in all aspects of his life.  He was a reserve police \nofficer for 14 years, with aspirations of obtaining a full-time position on the force.  He \n\n \n9 \n \n \ntries to timely repay his debts, and is only hindered by his lack of better paying \nemployment.  He has lived in his community for 23 years and in the same house for \nthose years.  He has not moved frequently, causing creditors to lose track of his location \nand his debts to become delinquent. The primary issue is whether his financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance.  Applicant \nhas shown over two decades he can live within his means, and has not incurred any \nlong-term delinquent debt, except during his first two failed relationships when his \ncompanions incurred debts for which he became obligated. Applicant has demonstrated \nin a credible and persuasive manner, with his character statements, his employment \nhistory, his community stability, and his responsible attitude, that he is a reliable and \ntrustworthy person, and is not inclined to generate funds through illegal acts.  He is not \na threat to national security because of his long-time employment in the security officer \nemployment field.  He has a great interest in police work, and has spent many years in \nsuch work in his community as a security officer and reserve police officer.  There is \nnothing derogatory about his life in the file.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.l: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Clearance is denied.\nOn February 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nthe sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct guidelines. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on March 5, 2009, admitting that the conduct raised\na sexual behavior security concern, as set forth in Paragraph 1, but denying that the\nconduct constituted criminal conduct, as set forth in Paragraph 2. The case was\nJuly 13, 2009\n\n2\nassigned to me on April 2, 2009. On April 7, 2009 a Notice of Hearing was issued\nscheduling the case for April 30, 2009. \nAt the hearing, I received two government exhibits, eight Applicant exhibits, and\nApplicant\u2019s testimony. Also, at department counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative\nnotice of relevant state law defining prostitution, sexual acts, and solicitation of sexual\nacts (Exhibit I). The transcript was received on May 8, 2009.\nProcedural Ruling\nDepartment counsel moved to amend the SOR by cross-alleging the sexual\nbehavior allegation, set forth in SOR Paragraph 1, under an additional paragraph for\npersonal conduct. Applicant did not object, and admitted that his sexual behavior also\nraised a personal conduct security concern. I granted the motion.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old, married man with two teenage children. He has been\nmarried for 22 years. He earned a bachelor of science degree in computational science\nin 1979, and has been working in the software engineering field since graduating (Tr.\n20). He has spent the majority of his career working for defense contractors (Id.).\nCurrently, Applicant develops signal intelligence technology for a defense\ncontractor (Exhibit A at 2). According to his supervisor, he is a strong, innovative leader\nwho communicates well with customers (Exhibit D). Applicant is active in the community\ndonating blood to medical charities (Tr. 42).\nBetween 1998 and 2008, Applicant paid for, and received sexual massages from\nseveral females whom he solicited through the Internet (Tr. 32). The sexual activity did\nnot involve vaginal, oral, or anal intercourse, and was limited to use of the hands\n(Exhibit 2 at 5; Tr. 32). Applicant engaged in this activity twice per year, and the last\nepisode occurred in early 2008. He always paid cash for the services, and never left any\nidentifying information with the women (Tr. 37). \nSoliciting sexual massages constitutes a misdemeanor in the state where\nApplicant engaged in this activity (Exhibit I). He understands that soliciting prostitution is\nillegal, but did not know that soliciting sexual massages was illegal (Tr. 34). \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed this behavior during a June 2008 interview with an\nagent from the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM; Tr. 38). He\nrecognizes that the activity was wrong and immoral, and he has no intentions of\nengaging in this activity in the future (Tr. 10). He has never informed his wife of this\nactivity, and she is unaware of it (Tr. 32). He does not want to disclose it because of\n\u201cthe pain that it would cause her\u201d (Tr. 34). \n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 12). Applicant\u2019s solicitation of women for sexual massages\nconstituted criminal behavior under state law. His wife is unaware he indulged in this\nconduct. Consequently, AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or\nnot the individual has been prosecuted,\u201d 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an\nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and 13(d), \u201csexual\nbehavior . . . that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has not engaged in this activity for approximately 18 months. His\ntestimony reflected sincere remorse. However, he remains vulnerable to coercion\nbecause he never told his wife of the behavior, and acknowledges that he is afraid of\n\n4\nthe pain it would cause her if she were aware of it. The fairly recent nature of the\nconduct, and the vulnerability to coercion it poses renders all of the mitigating conditions\ninapplicable.\nApplicant has not mitigated the sexual behavior security concern.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) \u201c . . . multiple lesser\noffenses,\u201d and 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\nApplicant has a good employment record, and is active in his community. His\nstated remorse and his intention not to engage in any future such activity were credible.\nAG \u00b6 31(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining, or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement,\u201d applies.\nThe minor nature of Applicant\u2019s crime is outweighed by the presence of\nrehabilitation. He has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e),\n\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities\nwhich, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing .\n. .\u201d \nNone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply for the same reasons\nthat none of the sexual behavior mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has not mitigated\nthe personal conduct security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\n\n5\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was fairly recent, and he never informed his wife.\nConsequently, his vulnerability to coercion is unacceptably high. Upon evaluating this\ncase in light of the whole person concept, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On February 2, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant,\nwhich detailed security concerns under Guidelines F and E stating why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005,\nand effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \n\n2\nThe Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 2, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non March 23, 2009. This case was assigned to me on March 26, 2009.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 8, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 21,\n2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were received\nwithout objection. The Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through J, also without objection. The record was left open at the Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for the submission of additional documentation. The Applicant submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit K on June 2, 2009.  This exhibit was also received without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing on May 29, 2009. The record closed on\nJune 2, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 43, married, and has an Associate\u2019s degree. He is employed by\na defense contractor and seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment\nin the defense industry. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a.,\n1.b., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n. under Paragraph 1 of the SOR. Those admissions\nare hereby deemed findings of fact. He denied allegations 1.c., 1.e., 1.h., 1.i., i.j., 1.m.,\nand allegation 2.a. under Paragraph 2. He also provided explanations with his\nresponses.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he in financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in\nillegal acts to obtain funds.\nThe Applicant is a retired chief petty officer in the United States Navy. He retired\nin November 2004. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) The Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties began\nafter he married his current wife in 1998. The Applicant and his family were living in\nState One. His wife was from State Two, which is where her ex-husband lived. The wife\nbrought her children from her prior marriage to State One after the marriage, but one of\nthe children was actually supposed to be with her ex-husband. The ex-husband\nthreatened to sue to get his child back in State Two. To keep the entire family together,\nthe Applicant elected to move his wife and children to State Two, while he finished his\ntour in State One. Part of the reason for doing this was because the Applicant owned a\nhouse in State One. He quickly found the cost of maintaining two houses was\nimpossible, and he declared bankruptcy in 2000. (SOR 1.n.) (Transcript at 21-23, 68-72;\nGovernment Exhibit 3 at 12.)\nAs stated earlier, the Applicant retired from the Navy in November 2004, to help\nhis family stay together. From then until August 2007, the Applicant attempted to make\na living as a commission mortgage broker.  He found the work difficult, and the earnings\n\n3\nslim. Eventually, he decided the work was not for him and found salary work, first as a\ncredit analyst assistant, and then a field service representative. He then began working\nfor his current employer in October 2008, making more money. However, because of\nhis extended period of underemployment, the Applicant had a lot of past due debts. It\nwas in October 2008 that he began to make payments on his past due indebtedness.\n(Transcript at 24-27; Government Exhibit 3.)  \nThe Applicant\u2019s debts will be discussed in the order they are alleged in the SOR:\n1.a.  The Applicant admitted that he owed $2,500 for a used car to a collection\nagency.  He has also consistently disputed the validity of the debt. According to the\nApplicant, the driver\u2019s side door would not work on the car, and after several attempts to\nfix it, he returned the car due to this safety issue. He filed a dispute with the credit\nreporting agencies and, after an investigation, they have deleted this item from his credit\nreport. (Transcript at 31-33; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 3.)\n1.b.  The Applicant admitted this allegation, which stated he owed another\n$2,500 debt to the same collection agency. However, he also states that it is a duplicate\nof the debt set forth in 1.a., above.  This allegation is for the same amount, to the same\ncreditor, though the account numbers are different.  The Applicant filed a dispute with\nthe credit reporting agencies concerning this debt as well and, after an investigation,\nthey have also deleted this item from his credit report. (Transcript at 37-38; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E at 3.)\n1.c.  The Applicant denied that he owed a debt to a collection agency in the\namount of $530 for a utility bill. The Applicant showed that he paid $358.13 to this utility\nin November 2008. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 5.) The Applicant filed disputes with the\ncredit reporting agencies concerning two accounts allegedly owed to this utility,\nnumbers 5293606 and 5894430. After the required investigation these accounts were\ndeleted with the notation, \u201cNo record of account.\u201d (Transcript at 38-39, 67; Government\nExhibit 4 at 9, 13; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 4.)\n1.d.  The Applicant admitted that he owes a collection agency at least $2,503 for\na past due credit card bill.  This debt had not yet been paid as of the date of the hearing.\nThe Applicant indicated that his financial situation would allow him to begin paying this\ndebt in June 2009. (Transcript at 41-42, 50-51; Government Exhibit 3 at 10.)\n1.e.  The Applicant denied that he owed a past due debt to a collection agency in\nthe amount of $250. He submitted evidence showing that this debt was settled in full in\nJanuary 2008.  (Transcript at 51-52, 75-76; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Exhibit E at 4.)\n1.f.  The Applicant admitted that he owed a collection agency $1,418 for a past\ndue debt. He testified that he was negotiating with the creditor and would have them\npaid off before the end of May 2009. Subsequently, the Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit K, which shows on page 3 that the Applicant paid $882.50 on this account on\nMay 28, 2009. (Transcript at 52.)\n\n4\n1.g.  The Applicant admitted that he owes this account, but not for the reason\nstated in his Answer. The evidence shows that this was a returned check for $2,500.\nThis check was used as the down payment for the automobile loan set forth in\nallegation 1.h., below. The Applicant has not paid this debt, but intends to pay it as soon\nas possible, hopefully by January 2010 if not sooner. (Government Exhibit 4 at 8;\nTranscript at 53-55.) \n1.h.  The Applicant denied that he is indebted to Ford Motor Credit Company in\nthe amount of $5,740 for an automobile that was repossessed. The documentary\nevidence in the record confirms that this debt is actually with Triad, the creditor in 1.i.,\nbelow. The Applicant has not paid the debt in this subparagraph, but intends to pay it in\nthe near future. (Transcript at 35-36, 55-56; Government Exhibit 4 at 15.) \n1.i.  Th Applicant denied owing a debt to Triad in the amount of $250. A review of\nall of the available credit reports fails to show a debt of this amount to this creditor.\n(Transcript at 56-57; Government Exhibit 3 at 15-40, Exhibit 4, Exhibit 5, Exhibit 6,\nExhibit 7; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.)\n1.j.  The Applicant denied owing a debt to a collection agency in the amount of\n$2,043.  He supplied evidence that this debt was paid on or before February 23, 2009.\n(Transcript at 57-59; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\n1.k.  The Applicant admitted owing this debt to a collection agency in the amount\nof $1,721.  He testified that his plan was to pay this debt off before the end of June\n2009. (Transcript at 59-60.)\n1.l.  The Applicant admitted owing a credit union $10,064 for a charged off\naccount. He has not paid anything on this debt, but hopes to pay this debt through a\ndebt resolution company in the near future. (Transcript at 60-62.)\n1.m.  The Applicant denied owing a utility company $311 for a past due account.\nHe provided documentary evidence that this debt was paid in full in December 2008.\n(Transcript at 62-63; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 4.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He provided evidence that he\nhad paid other past due debts that, while referred to in the Financial Interrogatory he\nreceived from DOHA, were not part of the SOR. (Transcript at 64-67; Government\nExhibit 3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has made false statements to the Department of Defense during\nthe clearance screening process.\n\n5\nThe Applicant filled out a questionnaire for sensitive positions in March 2008 in\nwhich he stated that, within the past seven years, he had not been over 180 days\ndelinquent on any debts.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 28(a).)  This answer was\nincorrect, as all the debts set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.m., above, were\nover 180 days delinquent.\nThe Applicant testified at length on this issue.  (Transcript at 72-75, 79-82.)  He\nwas apologetic for not discussing these debts on his questionnaire, but also consistently\nand credibly testified that he did not intentionally provide false information about them.\nThe Applicant did not know the extent of his debts when he filled out the questionnaire,\nbut he also knew that his credit report would be part of the investigation. He stated that,\nas a Sailor with a 20 year career and a security clearance:\nI wouldn\u2019t seriously consider insulting anybody by thinking I could\nput \u201cno\u201d and that wouldn\u2019t have any - - I mean, that\u2019s not a good - - that is\nabsurd. . . . It was a mistake. A genuine mistake. It wasn\u2019t meant to\nmislead anybody involved in the security process. (Transcript at 81.)\nSupporting the Applicant\u2019s statement that he did not intend to deceive the\nGovernment regarding his debt situation is the fact that, in question 27, he did admit\nthat he had filed for bankruptcy in 2000. This put the Government on notice that he had\nfinancial issues. Under the particular facts of this case, I find that while his answer was\nincorrect, he did not intend to mislead the Government.  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant\u2019s current position mirrors the one he held in the Navy.  He\nsubmitted documents from his career that show he is a highly respected person in his\nfield.  (Transcript at 26-27; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G, Exhibit H, and Exhibit J.) \nThe Applicant also submitted a statement from his current supervisor, the\noperations manager. This person states, \u201c[The Applicant] has always displayed\npersonal accountability in our interactions.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K at 5-6.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\n\n6\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own common\nsense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the applicant's conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation,\nor mitigation that is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The\n\n7\napplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial\nevidence that the Applicant had financial difficulties (Guideline F), and that the Applicant\nmade false statements in the clearance screening process (Guideline E.)  The\nApplicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:     \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.  The Applicant failed to pay many debts for a period of years.  The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Mitigating Condition \u00b6 20(a) states that the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good\njudgment. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment. . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. The Applicant retired from the Navy for important personal reasons. He\nfound the transition difficult, as he attempted to work in a field outside of his expertise.\nOnce he returned to the field of his expertise, and was making good money, he began\nimmediately working to resolve his debt situation. The evidence raises these potentially\nmitigating conditions. \nThe Applicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable, in that he can pay his current\nindebtedness and work steadily at reducing his past due debts. This brings his conduct\nwithin the purview of AG \u00b6 20(c), the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control. Evidence that the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\n\n8\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts is also mitigating under \u00b6 20(d).  The Applicant\nshowed that he has successfully paid off or otherwise resolved over $9,800 of the debts\nalleged in the SOR. Adding in the payments to past due bills not alleged in the SOR, the\namount rises to $11,259. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions apply.\nAs shown above, the Applicant has been paying many of his bills.  Where he\nthere has been a legitimate question concerning the validity of a debt, he has been\nproactive in filing disputes with the credit reporting agencies.  This conduct brings him\nwithin the purview of AG \u00b6 20(e), which states it is mitigating where \u201cthe individual has a\nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d\nThe Applicant began working on his debts long before the SOR was issued, he\ncontinues to work on them diligently. The Applicant realizes the importance of resolving\nhis debt situation, and has the ability and drive to make sure he accomplishes this task.\nMost of all, he realizes that he must do this to retain his security clearance. For all the\nforegoing reasons, Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Applicant did provide incorrect information on his questionnaire concerning\nthe past due debts alleged in the SOR. However, the evidence is clear that the\nApplicant did not intentionally falsify his questionnaire. He is a knowledgeable retired\nSailor and his credible testimonial evidence on this point was very persuasive. He made\na bad assumption about how the investigation would go, but in the prior question he had\nput the Government on notice about his financial difficulties. As stated earlier, he freely\ndisclosed that he had filed for bankruptcy in 2000. Here, the Applicant made a mistake,\nbut was not intentionally deceptive.  Guideline E is found for the Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) in making such a decision:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n9\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, in particular the extent of his past\ndue indebtedness, his payment or resolution of eight of the debts alleged in the SOR,\nthe fact that he credibly testified he will continue to make payments on his other debts,\nand his unintentionally false statement to the Government.  Three of the factors have\nthe most impact on this case.  First, I find that there is the \u201cpresence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes,\u201d as set forth under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nThe Applicant has shown that his failure to pay his debts was a temporary situation\nbrought about by his employment situation and that it is being corrected.  Under the\nparticular facts of this case, there is little or no \u201cpotential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress\u201d as set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)(8).  Finally, there is little to no\n\u201clikelihood of continuation or recurrence\u201d as discussed in AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n.:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor the Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.b. He admits all of the other SOR allegations. Applicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has been employed as a maintenance person with his company since January 2008. In 2007, he was laid off for one year, but he has worked for the same company for approximately seven years. He requires a security clearance 3 in order to perform maintenance work in three rooms that are considered secure facilities. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. His highest level of education is the 10th grade. He states that he is able to read and understand the SOR allegations. He is single and has no children. (Tr at 4-7, 30-31; Gov 1.) Financial Considerations Applicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he had a significant amount of delinquent medical debts.

On January 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn March 3, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On July 30, 2009, Department Counsel amended the SOR \ndetailing additional concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct. Applicant answered the Amendment to the SOR on August 14, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on October 9, 2009. The case was assigned \nto me on October 16, 2008. On November 20, 2009, a Notice of Hearing was issued, \nscheduling the hearing for December 8, 2009. The case was heard on that date. The \nFebruary 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered six exhibits which were admitted without objection as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 6. The Applicant testified, called one witness, and offered two \nexhibits which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - B. The \nrecord was held open until January 19, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments.  He timely submitted four additional documents that were admitted as AE C \n\u2013 AE F. The transcript was received on December 14, 2009.  Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel noted that there is no SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, 1.s, and 1.t. (Tr at 13) \n \n \nIn the Amendment to the SOR dated August 4, 2009, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b - 2.d were \nadded under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. A new paragraph three was added raising \nsecurity concerns under Criminal Conduct. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.i were added.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel motioned to amend the SOR on several \noccasions pursuant to paragraph E.3.1.17 of the Directive in order to conform with the \nevidence. Applicant had no objection to the motions. The amendments include: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.rr was added which reads:  \n \nYou are indebted to AFNI Bloom-Verizon in the amount of $481. As of \nNovember 4, 2008, this debt had not been paid. (Tr at 36-37) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.rr replaced SOR \u00b6 1.w. SOR \u00b6 1.w is found for Applicant. (Tr at 38) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b was amended by changing paragraphs 1.h, 1.e, and 1.f to paragraphs \n3.h, 3.e, and 3.f.  (Tr at 77-78) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c was amended by changing paragraphs 1.h, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f to \nparagraphs 3.h, 3.d, 3.e, and 3.f. (Tr at 71-72) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d was amended by changing paragraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c to \nparagraphs 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. (Tr at 80-81) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n3.b. He admits all of the other SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has been employed as a maintenance person with his \ncompany since January 2008. In 2007, he was laid off for one year, but he has worked \nfor the same company for approximately seven years. He requires a security clearance \n\n \n3 \n \n \nin order to perform maintenance work in three rooms that are considered secure \nfacilities. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. His highest level of \neducation is the 10th grade. He states that he is able to read and understand the SOR \nallegations. He is single and has no children. (Tr at 4-7, 30-31; Gov 1.)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance background investigation revealed that he had a \nsignificant amount of delinquent medical debts. The SOR alleges 37 delinquent medical \naccounts, an approximate total of $54,633. Of that amount, five of his medical creditors \nhave obtained judgments against him. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.q, 1.u \u2013 1.mm, 1.oo \u2013 1.qq: Gov \n2; Gov 3; Gov 4) Applicant also has a $856 telephone account that was placed for \ncollection in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 2 at 5; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 4 at 19); a $772 \njudgment entered against him in October 2002 by the County Board of Supervisors for \nan unpaid fine (SOR \u00b6 1.nn: Gov 2 at 14; Gov 4 at 3) ; and a $481 telephone account \nplaced for collection in December 2007. (SOR \u00b6 1.rr: Gov 2 at 9; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 4 at 5) \nThe total amount of the consumer debt is $2,109. The total amount of delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR is $56,742.  \n \nApplicant has had significant health problems over the past few years. He has \nasthma and kidney stones. He has been hospitalized approximately 6 times related to \ncomplications from his asthma. He has had eight kidney operations within the past five \nyears related to his kidney stones. In 2009, he was hospitalized when he had \npneumonia. In 2006, he had appendicitis. In 2007, he suffered from herniated disks. His \nmedical debts became delinquent because he did not have health insurance and does \nnot earn enough income to pay the medical bills. Applicant estimates that he owes \napproximately $60,000 in medical bills. He has not been able to pay any of the medical \nbills. (Tr at 25-26, 35, 45, 49-51,91)  \n \nWith regard to the $856 telephone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant claims \nthat a friend of his niece\u2019s opened a cell phone account in his name without his \npermission. He discovered the account about a year and a half ago. He has not formally \ndisputed the account. The account has not been resolved. (Tr at 32-34) \n \nThe $481 telephone debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.rr is a telephone account that he \nopened for his sister. The account has not been resolved. (Tr at 36-37, AE C; AE D) \n \nApplicant believes the county garnished his paycheck in order to collect the $772 \njudgment entered against him which is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.nn. He believes it is for an \nunpaid fine related to one of his criminal convictions. (Tr at 58) His paycheck is also \nbeing garnished by a hospital. (Tr at 58-60; AE F) \n \nApplicant lives with his sister, her ex-husband, and her 27-year-old son. His \nsister owns a home and Applicant pays one half of the mortgage. His sister is on \ndisability because of congestive heart failure and kidney failure. She is on kidney \ndialysis. She is behind on the mortgage. She has not been able to pay the mortgage \n\n \n4 \n \n \nsince March 2009. She recently was awarded $2,300 a month in disability payments. \nShe hopes to refinance the mortgage but is concerned that she will lose the house. She \ntestified during the hearing that Applicant gives her most of his money in order to pay \nthe bills. They struggle to pay the bills. Her son does not work because he has mental \nhealth issues. Her ex-husband lives with them but only works sporadically. She trusts \nher brother. She believes he is dedicated and honest. (Tr at 30, 51, 106, 112-127) \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $1,530. He used to pay his \nsister $800 for rent. He now pays her $1,200 because of her illness. Other expenses \ninclude groceries, $200; utilities, $250; medical, $60; miscellaneous/transportation \ncosts, $50. His monthly expenses total $1,760. He sporadically pays $20 a month \ntowards a dental bill which has a $180 balance. He has a negative monthly balance of \n$230 a month. (Tr at 97-102) \n \nApplicant has not attended financial counseling. He applied for a loan to pay his \nbills but it was denied. He looked into filing for bankruptcy but cannot afford the attorney \nfees. (Tr at 96-97, 105; Gov 2) He did not file federal income taxes in 2007 because he \ndid not earn any income. His employer laid him off in 2007 because of his absenteeism \nand tardiness which was related to his health issues. His employer called him back to \nwork a year later. (Tr at 93 \u2013 97, 105; Gov 2) \n \nAt hearing, Applicant indicated that he still owed the $5,500 debt resulting from \nan automobile repossession in 2000. This debt was not alleged in the SOR. (Tr at 95; \nGov 4 at 7) Applicant does not have a driver\u2019s license because he cannot afford to get \nhis license back. He rides a bike to work. (Tr at 57)  \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nApplicant has been arrested eight times since October 1985. The arrests \nbeginning with the most recent include: \n \nOn August 12, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with Grand Larceny, a \nfelony. He pleaded to Petit Larceny, a misdemeanor. He received a 30-day suspended \njail sentence and was fined $522. Applicant states that he was accused of stealing $800 \nworth of hardwood flooring from Home Depot. His brother-in-law told him to start loading \nup the equipment and he would pay for it. Applicant started to walk out of the store with \nthe material. His brother-in-law ran away and had not paid for the materials. Applicant\u2019s \nsister claims that it was a misunderstanding. She was in the store with her ex-husband \nwhen Applicant was arrested. (Tr at 63 \u2013 65, 113; Gov 5) \n \nOn September 5, 2004, it is alleged Applicant was arrested in Richmond, Virginia \nand charged with Contempt of Court. Applicant denies this arrest. He does not \nremember it. He does not believe that he was ever arrested in Richmond, Virginia. The \ngovernment\u2019s evidence consists of an FBI Identification Record. It states that the FBI \nreceived from the Criminal Record Exchange in Richmond a charge of Contempt of \nCourt for a person whose name is similar to Applicant\u2019s but the first and middle name \n\n \n5 \n \n \nare different. There is insufficient record evidence to conclude Applicant was arrested \nfor Contempt of Court on September 5, 2004, The allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.b is found for \nApplicant. (Tr at 61-63) \n \nOn June 10, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Hit and Run and \nDriving on a Suspended License. He received a 90-day sentence (suspended) and a \n$500 fine for the Hit and Run charge. He received a 10-day sentence for the Driving on \na Suspended License charge. While the government presented no evidence pertaining \nto this arrest, Applicant admits the offense. He backed into another car in a parking lot. \nHe was driving on a suspended license and was afraid what might happen so he left the \nscene of the accident. His jail sentences were suspended. He made some payments \ntowards the fine but is not sure whether he paid the fines off. (Tr at 55-57)  \n \nOn January 13, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of \nMarijuana. Applicant pleaded guilty. He does not recall the sentence because it has \nbeen so long. The record evidence does not provide the sentence. (Tr at 48; Gov 6) \n \nOn October 15, 1992, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession of \nCocaine, a felony. On July 1, 1993, he was found guilty and sentenced to eight years in \nprison, suspended, with five years probation. He was also ordered to attend drug \ntreatment. (Gov 5; Gov 6) Applicant states that he has not used illegal drugs for 17 \nyears. His court-ordered drug treatment helped him to become sober. The drug \nallegations occurred when he was in his 20s. (Tr at 46-48, 53) \n \nOn February 28, 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with Narcotic \nCocaine with intent to sell; possession of narcotic equipment-processing. He was found \nguilty and sentenced to six years in jail, suspended, and two years supervised \nprobation. (Tr at 47; Gov 5) \n \nOn October 23, 1985, Applicant was arrested and charged with Concealment of \nMerchandise. The charge was dismissed. Applicant was caught shoplifting a walkman. \n(Tr at 54; Gov 5) \n \nApplicant disclosed on his security clearance application in response to question \n23 that he was arrested in 1985 for possession of drugs and received three years \nprobation. (Gov 1, question 23) This arrest is alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.h. I find for Applicant \nwith regard to SOR \u00b6 3.h because the government presented no record evidence of the \narrest. More than likely it is the same offense as the offense alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e or \n3.f. It is reasonable to conclude that Applicant confused the dates of his arrest. SOR \u00b6 \n3.h is found for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant has not been arrested since 2006. He is not sure whether all of the \nfines have been paid for his court sentences. He believes his wages have been \ngarnished for unpaid fines owed to the court. (Tr at 55-58, 67)  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application on March 24, 2008, \nhe answered, \u201cNo\u201d to question 27(d) which asks: \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any \njudgments against you that have not been paid?\u201d He did not list the judgments alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.ll \u2013 1.qq. Applicant answered, \u201cYes\u201d in response to question 28a, \u201cIn the \nlast 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He also \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d in response to question 28(b) \u201cAre you currently over 90 days \ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He listed a $5,500 debt owed as a result of an automobile \nrepossession in March 2000 and indicated it was satisfied in July 2003. He also listed a \n$15,000 medical debt incurred in December 1990 (Gov 1.)  \n \nOn the same security clearance application, dated March 24, 2008, Applicant \nanswered, \u201cYes\u201d in response to question 23(a), \u201cHave you ever been charged with or \nconvicted of any felony offense (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice)?\u201d In the remarks section of section 23, Applicant listed an arrest in October \n2006 which he lists as a misdemeanor but did not list the offense, and an October 1985 \nfelony arrest for possession of drugs. He was sentenced to three years probation. (Gov \n1) The SOR alleges he intentionally omitted the felony arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.e \nand 3.f. \n \nOn the March 24, 2008, security clearance application, he answered, \u201cYes\u201d to \nquestion 23(d) which asks, \u201cHave you ever been charged or convicted of any offense(s) \nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d The SOR alleges he intentionally omitted the drug offenses \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.d, 3.e, and 3.f. In response to question 23(f) \u201cIn the last 7 years, \nhave you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in \nresponse to a, b, c, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the \nviolation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d, Applicant answered, \u201cyes\u201d and listed his 2006 \nconviction for Petit Larceny which is alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a. The SOR alleges he \nintentionally omitted the arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b and 3.c.  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he did not intend to falsify his security \nclearance application. He does not know how to use a computer. His sister helped him \ncomplete the security clearance application. He did not list some of his arrests because \nhe did not know that he had to list detailed information. He did not understand the \nquestion. He did not intend to withhold information about his arrests and judgments on \nhis security clearance application. In the future, if he files a security clearance \napplication he will contact someone who is knowledgeable about completing security \nclearance applications.   (Tr at 24, 67-83) \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister testified that she helped Applicant complete his security \nclearance application because he cannot read and write very well. She described him \nas being illiterate. She may have misunderstood some of the questions when \ncompleting the application. She has a tenth-grade education. (Tr at 117, 128-129) \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nReferences \n \nThe Director of Operations of Applicant\u2019s employer wrote a letter stating that \nApplicant is an excellent employee who is well-liked by his co-workers and peers. \nApplicant \u201cwould give anyone the shirt off his back\u201d and has a good attitude towards his \njob and company. Applicant has a good attendance record. He is always willing to help \neven when it is not his responsibility. Based on his past performance, he does not \nbelieve Applicant is a security risk. (AE E) \n \nApplicant\u2019s co-worker states that she has worked with him for five years. He has \nalways been professional. She enjoys working with Applicant because he has a positive \nattitude and is very kind-hearted. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \n\n \n8 \n \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC & 19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has encountered financial \ndifficulty since 2000. The SOR alleged 40 delinquent accounts, an approximate total \nbalance of $56,742. \n \nThe government\u2019s substantial evidence and applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. September 22, 2005)).  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems continue. His income is not sufficient to allow him to \nresolve his delinquent accounts.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Most of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \naccounts are medical accounts. Applicant has numerous health problems. He incurred \nmost of the delinquent debt because he had no health insurance. He does have three \ndelinquent accounts that consist of two telephone accounts and a judgment for fines \nowed to a local jurisdiction. Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant indicated that he \nstill owes $4,500 for an automobile repossession in 2000. He does not have an \nextensive amount of delinquent consumer debt considering his limited income.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant has not attended financial counseling. His financial \nproblems are unlikely to be resolved in the future. He is not only responsible for \nsupporting himself but also his sister who is unable to work because of health problems. \nHer ex-husband and 27-year-old son also live with them. Neither of them work which \nadds an additional financial burden.   \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply. While Applicant acknowledged his \ndebts, he is unable to repay his delinquent accounts. Without even considering the \ndelinquent debts, Applicant\u2019s monthly expenses are greater than his monthly income.  \nHe looked into filing for bankruptcy but is unable to afford the attorney fees.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) potentially applies with respect SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. Applicant claims that his niece\u2019s \nfriend opened up a telephone account in his name without his permission. He has not \ntaken steps to dispute the debt. For this reason, I find FC MC \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s income is insufficient to resolve his delinquent accounts and his \nfinancial responsibilities. The concerns under Guideline F are not mitigated.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n10 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal Conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list judgments \nin response to question 27(d) and all of his criminal arrests in response to questions \n23(a), 23(d), and 23(f) on his security clearance application, dated March 24, 2008.  \n \n  \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies in \nApplicant\u2019s case. For PC DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission of his judgments and \ndelinquent accounts must be done with a deliberate intent to deceive. I find Applicant \ndid not deliberately intend to falsify his security clearance application. Applicant asked \nhis sister to help him fill out the security application because he did not know how to \noperate a computer. His sister testified that Applicant cannot read and write very well. \nThe highest level of education Applicant and his sister have achieved is the 10th grade.  \n \n \nApplicant did not understand that he had to list each arrest in detail. He \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to all of the questions that he allegedly falsified under section 23. He did \nnot list all of the arrests. While he answered, \u201cno\u201d to question 27(d) regarding whether \nhe had judgments, in response to questions 28(a) and 28(b), he listed that he had \n$15,000 in medical debts and owed $5,500 from an automobile repossession. He put \nthe government on notice that he had financial problems and a criminal history. \nConsidering his level of education, I find his explanation that he did not understand the \nquestions on the security clearance application credible. I also believe his sister may not \nhave completely understood the questions. I find for Applicant under the personal \nconduct concern. \n  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 30 of \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are several Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). From 1985 to 1993, \nApplicant was arrested on four occasions. Three of the arrests were drug-related \ncharges. Two of the arrests were felony arrests for cocaine-related offenses. In 2001, \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for Hit and Run and Driving on a Suspended License. In August \n2006, he was arrested for Grand Larceny, a felony. He pleaded to misdemeanor Petit \nLarceny.  \n \nThe following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. \nMore than three and a half years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last arrest. While \nApplicant was not certain that he had paid all of his court fines, his paycheck has been \ngarnished in order to recover the fines. His inability to pay his fines is the result of his \ncurrent financial situation as opposed to additional criminal conduct.    \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies. Applicant has turned his life around since his drug-\nrelated offenses in the early 1990s. He was ordered by the court to attend inpatient drug \ntreatment and appears to have remained drug free after completing treatment. He has \nhad no drug-related arrests for over 17 years. He has had no additional criminal arrests \nsince 2006. He is highly thought of by his employer. For this reason, the criminal \nconduct concern is mitigated. \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \n\n \n12 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nemployment record and the favorable comments of his co-worker. I considered his \nextensive delinquent debt and that most of the delinquent accounts are medical \naccounts caused by Applicant\u2019s health problems and a lack of health insurance. I also \nconsidered that Applicant\u2019s expenses are more each month than his income. While he \ndoes not live extravagantly, he provides support for his sister who is unable to work and \nis on disability as well her ex-husband and adult son who do not work full-time. He is \nunable to resolve his delinquent accounts and is likely to incur additional delinquent \ndebt in the future. While Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in order for the court to \nretrieve Applicant\u2019s court-ordered fines, his inability to pay his fines is more an issue \nunder financial considerations as opposed to additional criminal conduct. It has been \nover three and a half years since Applicant\u2019s last arrest. Concerns under criminal \nconduct are mitigated. Personal conduct concerns are found for Applicant because I \nfind that he did not intentionally falsify his security clearance application. Doubts remain \nunder the financial considerations concern because of Applicant\u2019s extensive debt and \nhis limited income. Mindful of my responsibility to rule in favor of national security in \ncases where there is doubt, I conclude that concerns under financial considerations \nremain.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r - 1.t: \n \n \nNo allegations \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u - 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.x - 1.rr:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nOctober 13, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn January 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nG, H, and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn February 12, 2010, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on March 8, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 9,\n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 5, 2010. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted Exhibit A at the time of hearing, which was also\nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\nApril 19, 2010, to submit additional documents. He timely submitted a cover letter and\n\n2\nfive character letters, which have been identified collectively and entered into evidence\nwithout objection as Exhibit B. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on April\n13, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of\nApplicant, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.d., under\nGuideline G, 2.a. through 2.c., under Guideline H, and 3.a. under Guideline E. He\nindicated that he did not know if 1.e. was correct. The admitted allegations are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 54 years old. He is married, but legally separated from his wife since\n2004.  Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the five allegations as\nthey are cited in the SOR, and as reviewed above, 1. a. through 1.d. have been\nadmitted by Applicant in his RSOR :\n1.a. In approximately 1977 or 1978, Applicant was arrested and charged with\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI).  He pled guilty to the charge of Reckless\nDriving and was sentenced to pay a fine of $500. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this\nallegation.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that on the day of this event he had consumed\napproximately a case or three six packs of beer, and he drove home from a wedding\nanniversary party when this arrest occurred. (Tr at 31-33.)\n1.b. In approximately July 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.\nHe was convicted and found guilty of DUI and was sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000,\nand to attend an outpatient alcohol treatment program. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted\nthis allegation. In his RSOR and during his testimony, Applicant admitted that he was\nguilty. He thereafter plead No Contest to the charge and  paid a fine of approximately\n$1,000. He testified that as part of the sentence, he attended two months of outpatient\ntreatment, two times a week, and then attended two months of Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA) meetings. During the outpatient treatment, he was advised to abstain completely\nfrom alcohol consumption, which he did for six or eight months, but then he resumed his\nalcohol consumption. (Tr at 33-35.) \n\n3\n1.c. The SOR alleges that despite receiving recommendations from three alcohol\ntreatment programs that he attended to abstain from alcohol consumption, Applicant\nhas continued to consume alcohol until at least January 18, 2009. Applicant testified\nthat presently he continues to drink in an amount from three or four beers to two six-\npacks, on approximately five occasions during the last year before the date of the\nhearing. He continues to drink simply as a form of socializing. (Tr at 35-39.) When he\nwas questioned later about an answer he gave on an interrogatory (Exhibit 4), Applicant\nconceded that on one occasion in January 2009, he consumed 10 beers during one\nday. (Tr at 69.) He also testified that a domestic disturbance that he had with his wife in\n2004, was at least partially due to alcohol consumption. (Tr at 69-70.) Finally, in Exhibit\n4, Applicant indicated that he did not intend to consume alcohol in the future. He clearly\nhas not followed this plan. \n1.d. In approximately April 2006, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated for\nfailing a urinalysis test, which detected excessive alcohol in his system.\nApplicant testified that he had consumed too much alcohol on the previous night,\nand it resulted in a positive urinalysis the next day at work. He estimated that he had\nconsumed three shots of vodka and a six pack of beer. He received the urinalysis test\nbecause that was his first day employed by that company.  After his termination, he was\ninformed that he should receive rehabilitation, if he had any hopes of being rehired at a\nlater date by this company. (Tr at 39-41.)\n1.e. On or about May 8, 2009, Applicant was diagnosed by a licensed\nindependent substance abuse counselor as \u201cAlcohol dependent with Psychological\nDependence.\u201d Applicant testified that he had never received the report from the\ncounselor, and the first time he viewed it was after it was sent to him from Department\nCounsel. Exhibit 3 contains the report from the counselor. Among the findings on the\nreport is that Applicant is Alcohol Dependent, which is based on three factors: 1) A need\nfor markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication of desired\neffect, 2) the substance is often taken in larger amounts or over longer periods than was\nintended, and 3) there is a persistent desire of unsuccessful efforts to cut down or\ncontrol substance abuse. Based on these findings he was found to have a \u201cHigh\nProbability for Substance Abuse Disorder.\u201d\nUnder cross examination, Applicant justified his continuing to consume alcohol,\ndespite all of the problems it has caused him by saying, \u201cI really like the taste of beer.\u201d\nHe conceded that he could be an alcoholic, and he continues to consume alcohol, in\nspite of the fact that all of the counselors he has seen have advised him to abstain\ncompletely from alcohol. (Tr at 55-59.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists three allegations regarding illegal drug involvement under\nAdjudicative Guideline H. As stated above, all of these allegations were admitted by\nApplicant in the RSOR., although his testimony, as will be reviewed below, differed from\n\n4\nthe SOR in terms of dates of usage. They will be discussed in the same order as they\nwere listed in the SOR:\n2.a. The SOR alleges that Applicant used Crystal Methamphetamine\napproximately five times during the period from 2001 to 2008. At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that he was not certain what the period of usage was. He purchased the Crystal\nMethamphetamine that he used for approximately $20 each time. (Tr at 45-46.)\n2.b. The SOR alleges that Applicant used cocaine in approximately 2000.\nApplicant testified that he used cocaine on 20 occasions from 1976, when he was 20,\nuntil his last usage in 2000. He estimated that he purchased the cocaine about 10 times\nfor $80 to $100 each time. The other times he used it, it was given to him. (Tr at 46-48.) \n2.c.  The SOR alleges that Applicant used prescription drugs that were not\nprescribed to him, on approximately four or five occasions during the period from 2001\nto 2008. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he used the drugs of a friend for pain\nafter he injured his back. (Tr at 49-50.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n3.a. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), which was\nexecuted by him on February 28, 2008 (Exhibit 1.)  Question #24 of the SCA asked\nsince the age of 16 or in the previous seven years, whichever is shorter, had Applicant\nillegally used any controlled substance? Applicant answered \"No\" to this question, and\nhe listed no illegal substances. The Government alleges, and the evidence is clear that\nApplicant should have included all of his illegal drug usage as included in\nsubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c., above.  In his RSOR, Applicant wrote about this\nallegation, \u201cIn response to my dishonesty pertaining to section 24: The question was\ngiven orally I mistook the answer as \u2018no\u2019 instead of \u2018yes\u2019 that was my mistake and I\nadmit to being wrong about my answer.\u201d (Sic.)\nAt the hearing Applicant continued to aver that he had misunderstood the\nquestion, and he was not attempting to give untruthful answers. (Tr at 50-51.) However,\nin Exhibit 2, which contains a Report of Investigation that was ratified by interrogatories,\nit states, \u201cSubject failed to list the above information concerning his drug use on his SF\n89, because he was embarrassed.\u201d \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted five character letters in Exhibit B from individuals who have\nknown Applicant in his employment capacity and wrote in positive terms about him. He\nwas described as \u201ccompletely reliable and deserving of a position of trust.\u201d\n\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in two DUI arrests and convictions,\na termination from employment, and a diagnosis as being Alcohol Dependent from a\nsubstance abuse counselor. \nThe Government established that Applicant was involved in \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work,\u201d and \u201cbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgement.\u201d Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 22(a) and (c) apply to this case.  \nAs stated above, Applicant admitted to currently drinking beer on a regular basis,\nand to consuming as many as 10 beers at one time. This is despite the fact that\nApplicant has been advised not to consume any alcohol in the future by three\nrehabilitation programs that he attended, and after he averred in a response to an\ninterrogatory that he intended not to consume alcohol in the future. As a result of this, I\ndo not find that any Mitigating Condition under \u00b6 23 applies. Paragraph 1 Guideline G is\nfound against Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)\nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.\nApplicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use for many\nyears of marijuana, and other illegal substances is of great concern, especially in light of\nhis desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining\nto his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying\nCondition AG \u00b6 25(a) \u201cany drug abuse\u201d and (c) \u201cillegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.\u201d\nBased on the Applicant\u2019s recency of  use of illegal substances, and his lack of\ncandor in the information that he provided to the Government about his drug\ninvolvement, I cannot conclude at this time that Applicant\u2019s conduct comes within any\nMitigating Condition under AG \u00b6 26. \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving that Applicant\nhas used illegal drugs for many years under Guideline H. Applicant, on the other hand,\nhas failed to introduce persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which\nis sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.  Accordingly, Paragraph 2\nGuideline H of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant furnished to\nthe Government incomplete, untruthful answers regarding his drug involvement on an\nSCA that he executed on February 28, 2008.\n\n7\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material\nfacts or fails to furnish relevant information to a Government investigator, it is extremely\ndifficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty\nnecessary for an individual given a clearance. In this case, I conclude that Applicant\nknowingly and willingly failed to give complete, honest answers regarding his drug\nusage to the Government.\nIn reviewing the disqualifying conditions under Guideline E, I conclude that\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire\u201d that \u00b6 16(a) applies against Applicant. I\nfind no mitigating conditions can be applied. I therefore, resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the disqualifying conditions apply and the mitigating conditions do not\napply, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\n\n8\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.- 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a.-2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He served in the U.S. Army from July 1997 to June \n2004.

[include non-judicial, Captain\u2019s mast, etc.]). Applicant answered the \nquestion \u201cno.\u201d (Items 5 and 6) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on May 17, 1998, on charged with driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol, improper use of disabled parking privileges, and illegal \nconsumption of ethyl alcohol by an underage person. Applicant committed these \noffenses when he was 19 years old and serving in the U.S. Army. Applicant pled guilty \nto the lesser charge of driving while ability impaired. The other charges were dismissed. \nApplicant received a 12-month deferred sentence, ordered to pay $200 in fines and \ncourt costs, ordered to perform 24 hours of community service, and had his driving \nprivileges for six months. Applicant did not list this arrest on his e-QIP in answer to \nQuestion 23 (d) (\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) \nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d), responding to this question with a negative reply. \nApplicant also failed to disclose in his response to the March 2009 DOHA \nInterrogatories this arrest in response to Question 51 (\u201cHave you ever been arrested, \ncharged or held by any law enforcement authorities for any reason.\u201d). Applicant \n \n1 The SOR alleges this question is \u201c25,\u201d but there are only six questions in the interrogatory marked as \nItem 7. The text cited in the SOR is Question 5 in the interrogatory. This error is a typing error and not a \nsubstantial error.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\nanswered the question with an affirmative reply and disclosed his 2007 arrest, but not \nthis 1998 arrest. (Items 5, 6, 7, 10, and 12) \n \n \nApplicant was arrested on December 8, 2007, on charges of driving while \nintoxicated (first offense) (DWI) and failure to maintain a traffic lane. He pled guilty to \ndriving while intoxicated. In February 2008 Applicant was placed on one year of \nsupervised probation, ordered to pay fines of $85, to attend and complete 24 hours of \ncommunity service, to attend DWI school, and to attend a victim impact panel. Applicant \ndid not list this arrest on his e-QIP in answer to Question 23 (d) (\u201cHave you ever been \ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d), responding to \nthis question with a negative reply. Applicant did not complete the community service \nordered, nor pay the fines ordered, nor attend the DWI school and the victim impact \npanel. The court issued bench warrants on January 14, 2008, January 24, 2008, \nFebruary 18, 2008, and again on March 24, 2008, to enforce these requirements. \nApplicant pled guilty to the offenses of failure to attend the DWI school and the victim \nimpact panel and ordered to forfeit his bond on each offense. Applicant explained these \nfailures to attend the required classes as caused by his busy travel schedule which \nallowed him to be home only one weekend a month. The classes only met during the \nweek when he was not in his home area. (Items 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12) \n \n \nIn May 2006 Applicant was terminated by his former defense contractor employer \nfor being late for work. Applicant was late for work 11 times between January 6, 2006 \nand April 27, 2006. He was counseled verbally and in writing six times between \nSeptember 19, 2005 and December 21, 2005. Applicant did not disclose this termination \nin response to Question 22 on his e-QIP (\u201cHas any of the following happened to you in \nthe last 7 years? 1. Fired from a job; 2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired; 3. Left \na job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct; 4. Left a job by mutual \nagreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance; 5. Left a job for other \nreasons under unfavorable circumstances.\u201d). He answered the question with a \u201cno.\u201d \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on July 11, 2008. During that \ninterview he stated he voluntarily resigned from his prior employment with the first \ndefense contractor, denied any written warnings were given, denied being terminated, \nand stated he was eligible for rehiring. His Answer to the SOR admits he was \nterminated because of tardiness resulting from his 64 mile drive one-way daily from his \nhome to his place of employment. (Items 4, 5, 6, and 13) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR denies any falsification of any of his information \non the e-QIP or as given to the government investigator in July 2008. He explained he \nanswered the e-QIP \u201cin a quick manner and forgot to include the information.\u201d He also \nstated he knew his background information would be found during the investigation. \nApplicant denied that his past actions reflect on his current trustworthiness and says he \nis a productive employee for his company. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant did not list his first-born child in his response to Sections 14/15 of the e-\nQIP. That child was born in 2004. He also failed to list a former home address in his e-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nQIP. Applicant admitted these failures to the government investigator in July 2008. \n(Items 4 and 6) \n \n \nApplicant told the government investigator his current alcohol consumption in \nJuly 2008 was \u201cone to three beers with dinner per month.\u201d He told the investigator that \nhis last intoxication, which he did not feel as such, was his December 2007 DWI arrest \nand his blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.12%. Applicant also told the investigator he \nhas never received any alcohol counseling nor been referred for treatment. His answers \nto the March 2009, DOHA Interrogatory state he drank a beer with dinner at home one \nmonth prior to completing the interrogatory, and he drinks one to two beers monthly. He \nalso stated he does not drink to intoxication and only at home when he is not going to \ndrive. Drinking has not hampered his work performance, according to Applicant. (Items \n6 and 7) \n \n \nApplicant has had a security clearance since 1997 when he was in the Army. His \nsecurity access was suspended after his 1998 DWI arrest. It was granted in 1999 after \nthat incident was concluded. (FORM Response; Item 11) \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Of these seven conditions, two conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \n \nApplicant has two DWI arrests with resulting court sentences to his guilty pleas. \nThe two offenses occurred in 1998 and 2007. The second offense is recent and \noccurred away from work. He was ordered to attend certain classes and a victim impact \npanel, along with paying fines and performing community service. He did not complete \nthose requirements. Bench warrants were issued by the state court for Applicant to \ncompel compliance. Applicant did not submit any documentary proof he ever complied \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nwith those requirements. Therefore, these two disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. None of \nthem apply based on the evidence Applicant presented: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n  \n \nApplicant does not admit to any alcohol problem. He did not attend any alcohol \ncounseling and has not been referred for any alcohol rehabilitation program. His latest \nDWI arrest was in 2007, which was recent. It is of concern because of this arrest was \nhis second such arrest in nine years, and his BAC was 0.12%, more than the standard \nminimum amount for intoxication under state laws. Therefore, none of the mitigating \nconditions apply to Applicant.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group \n \n \nApplicant intentionally, deliberately, and repeatedly falsified information about his \ntwo DWI arrests and convictions, his prior employment and termination by his former \nemployer, and his Army Article 15 actions and subsequent administrative discharge for \na pattern of misconduct under Army regulations on his May 2, 2008 e-QIP. He also \ngave false and misleading information to the government investigator in July 2008 about \nhis job termination. While the SOR did not allege Applicant\u2019s failure to list his child and a \nprior home address on the e-QIP, they do strengthen the showing that there is a pattern \nof falsification and failures to disclose perpetrated by Applicant on official government \nsecurity forms. AG \u00b6 16 (a) and (b) apply. \n \nThe reasons for Applicant\u2019s Article 15, administrative discharge, and workplace \ntermination by his prior employer were credible adverse information showing a pattern \nof inappropriate workplace behavior and rule violations. Applicant was habitually late for \nwork both as an Army service member and a civilian employee. This conduct creates \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress because it affects Applicant\u2019s ability \nto retain and obtain other employment in the future. I find AG \u00b6 16 (d) and (e) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes seven examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17. None of them apply: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, an such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9\n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nApplicant did not correct his deliberate falsifications concerning his alcohol-\nrelated driving offenses, his failure to complete the sentencing requirements ordered by \nthe state court judge for those offenses, nor his non-judicial punishments under the \nUCMJ, and the termination by his former employer, until confronted by the government \ninvestigator in the July 2008 interview. The omitted information casts doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment because it is material and \nsubstantive in security clearance process. Applicant has not acknowledged any \nwrongdoing nor obtained any counseling or rehabilitation for his past alcohol use. The \ninformation about his termination is substantiated. I find none of the above mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was over 18 years old when \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10\nhe committed the driving offenses, when he received the non-judicial punishment while \nin the U.S. Army for tardiness, and when he failed to answer the e-QIP questions \ntruthfully.  \n \nHis historical pattern of misconduct shows he was late for military formations and \nwas derelict in his duty which resulted in his administrative discharge from the Army \nwith a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions, then late for work as a civilian \nwhich resulted in his termination, committed two DWI offenses, and lastly failed to \ndisclose all these incidents on his e-QIP when the government asked him to make a full \ndisclosure of his past activities. His alcohol incidents show a pattern of disrespect for \nthe law and a gross lack of judgment. He did not submit any information concerning \nalcohol rehabilitation. Instead, he minimized his alcohol use and involvement. This \ninaction leaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress based on \nthe repeated and serious nature of these offenses and his deliberate failure to disclose \nthem.  \n \nHis pattern of falsification and deprecation of his past activities continues to this \nday and is obviously voluntary. His FORM Response attempts to persuade the \ngovernment to grant a security clearance based on his current work performance and \nignoring his pattern of falsifications and workplace tardiness. His actions of this type will \ncontinue based on his past performance. Applicant displayed a lack of good judgment in \nthe Army and as a civilian employee of a defense contractor.  The Army suspended his \nsecurity access after his 1998 DWI arrest. In 2007 he committed another serious DWI \noffense (BAC of 0.12%) and then failed to complete the sentencing requirements. Next, \nhe exhibited a continued lack of appropriate judgment by failing to make proper and \ncomplete disclosures on his e-QIP. Applicant displays a pattern of inattentiveness, self-\ncenteredness, and lack of responsibility for his obligations. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or substantial doubts as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nAlcohol Consumption. He did not mitigate the security concerns under the guideline for \nPersonal Conduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n           Subparagraph 1.a to 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 20, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nA General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions is authorized under the following circumstance: \u201cIf an\n1\nairman\u2019s service has been honest and faithful, this characterization is warranted when significant negative aspects of the\nairman\u2019s conduct or performance outweigh positive aspects of the airman\u2019s military record.\u201d  Air Force Instruction 36-\n3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen, July 9, 2004, \u00b6 1.18.2.  \n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 29, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous delinquent debts.  Applicant engaged the\nservices of a credit counseling firm, which has established a plan to pay off Applicant\u2019s debts over\na five year period.  Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to poor choices and immaturity\nwhile he served in the U.S. Air Force.  At one time he considered filing for bankruptcy, although he\nhad not done so at the close of the record.\nIn 2006, Applicant was administratively discharged from the U.S. Air Force.  The reason for\nthe discharge was a pattern of misconduct, including incidents of failure to go to his appointed place\nof duty, dereliction of duty, failure to maintain sufficient funds to cover checks, false statements\nabout his financial condition, and failure to inform his supervisor about his financial condition.\nThese incidents had resulted in administrative counselings, a letter of reprimand, etc.  Applicant\nreceived a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions.   This is the basis for the Guideline E\n1\nsecurity concern. \nApplicant contends that he has demonstrated responsible behavior regarding his debts, citing\na decision of the Appeal Board which, he argues, supports his case.  He also cites to certain decisions\nby the Hearing Office to similar effect.  Regarding the Guideline E security concern, he contends that\nthe misconduct for which he was discharged from the Air Force was minor in nature and that he had\ndemonstrated rehabilitation.  \nWe have given due consideration to the Appeal Board case described in Applicant\u2019s brief.\nHowever, we conclude that it is distinguishable from Applicant\u2019s.  In the prior case, the debts\nresulted from a business downturn, which was outside the applicant\u2019s control.  In the case under\nconsideration here, however, Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due to his own poor choices.\nIndeed, the discharge from the Air Force was based in substantial measure upon willful misconduct,\nincluding financial misconduct.  Additionally, while we give due consideration to the Hearing Office\ncases cited by Applicant, they are also distinguishable from this case and, in any event, are not\nbinding precedent.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  We conclude that\nthese cases do not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline F was in error.\n\nSee Government Exhibit 16, Letter of Reprimand, August 23, 2005, which formed part of the basis for the\n2\ndischarge.  \u201cYou wrote checks to make payments on 9 payday loans which you were delinquent on and you had 11\nchecks returned for non-sufficient funds.  You admitted to me that when you wrote those checks . . . you knew you did\nnot have the money in the account to cover the checks.  Additionally, you lied to [SSgt A, MSgt B, and CMSgt C] when\nquestioned about your financial situation.  Your intent was to deceive us so we did not learn of your true financial status.\u201d\n3\nConcerning Guideline E, the record supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had failed\nto demonstrate mitigation.  His pattern of misconduct included financial wrongdoing.  His ongoing\nfinancial problems, and the Judge\u2019s finding that he had failed to resolve most of his significant debts,\nundermine a claim of rehabilitation.  Furthermore, the offenses for which Applicant was\nadministratively discharged are not uniformly minor in nature.   Therefore, we conclude that the\n2\nJudge did not err in his treatment of this Guideline.\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn May 13, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on May 27,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 10, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on August 12, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada.

At one point, he was considering filing\nbankruptcy, but thus far he has not gone forward with bankruptcy proceedings, because\nhe did not want it to hurt his potential to receive a security clearance (Tr at 45-47).\nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a.  The SOR alleged that on or about June 2006, Applicant was \u201cseparated from\nthe United States Air Force with an Under Honorable Conditions (General) discharge\ndue to a pattern of misconduct.\u201d\nApplicant testified that he believed he was only discharge because of his financial\ndifficulties. However, the documents submitted by Department Counsel establish that\nApplicant received his discharge for the following reasons: (1) Applicant failed to go to\nhis appointed place of duty at the proper time on more than one occasion, (2) Applicant\nfailed to properly maintain his Government quarters on more than one occasion, (3)\nApplicant issued several checks knowing there were insufficient funds, (4) Applicant\nmade false statements about his financial condition, and (5) Applicant failed to inform his\nsupervisor about his financial condition. Despite multiple letters of reprimand and\nattempts at counseling and rehabilitation, Applicant\u2019s Commanding Officer wrote that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct did not improve. His discharge was for \u201cA pattern of Misconduct,\nConduct Prejudicial to Good Order and Discipline\u201d (Exhibits 11 - 19). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n6\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay his obligations for a considerable period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n Since Applicant has not resolved most of his very significant debt, I do not find\nthat any Mitigating Condition (MC) is applicable. I conclude that until he is able to\nsignificantly reduce this debt, and establish a more stable financial picture, he has not\nmitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E,  I conclude that AG 15 \u00b6 DC (d) \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation . . . which, when combined with all information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information\u201d is applicable to Applicant. I\ndo not find that any MC applies under this Guideline.  I therefore, resolve Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition applies\nunder Guidelines F and E, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant\nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n        Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c. through 1.q.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.s. through 1.w.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b., 1.r., and 1.x.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a .:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Applicant is 53 years of age and employed as a Linguist. She seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Pakistan in 1956 to Pakistani parents. She came to the United States in 1978, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2006. In 1978, she was married in Pakistan to her spouse, also a Pakistani national, who became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1984. The Applicant has seven siblings. One of her siblings, a brother, is a citizen of the United States who resides in Pakistan. Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she intentionally falsified material aspects of her personal background during the employment process.

Cervi, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 31, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Position\non dated August 14, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 8).  On July 15, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines B and E for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 9, 2009, but\nsubmitted an incomplete answer by failing to admit or deny the allegations.  DOHA\nrequested the information by letter dated September 18, 2009.  Applicant responded\nwith another answer to the SOR on October 14, 2009, wherein she elected to have the\ncase determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel\nsubmitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on\nDecember 2, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal,\nextenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on\nDecember 19, 2009, and she submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\n\n2\nundersigned for resolution on February 5, 2010.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.    \nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a request that I take administrative notice of\ncertain facts concerning the current political conditions in Pakistan.  Applicant made no\nobjection.  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence\nbut were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\nFORM and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 53 years of age and employed as a Linguist.\nShe seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense\nindustry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Pakistan in 1956 to Pakistani parents.  She came to\nthe United States in 1978, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 2006.  In\n1978, she was married in Pakistan to her spouse, also a Pakistani national, who\nbecame a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1984.  The Applicant has seven\nsiblings.  One of her siblings, a brother, is a citizen of the United States who resides in\nPakistan.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because she intentionally falsified material\naspects of her personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing dated August 14, 2007.  Section 14/15 stated: \u201cYour relatives and\nAssociates: Give the full name, correct code, and other requested information for each\nof your relatives and associates, living or dead, specified below. 1. Mother, 2. Father, 3.\nStepmother, 4. Stepfather, 5. Foster Parent, 6. Child (Adopted and Foster Child also), 7.\nStepchild, 8. Brother, 9. Sister, 10. Stepbrother, 11. Stepsister, 12. Half-brother, 13.\nHalf-sister, 14. Father-in-law, 15. Mother-in-law, 16. Guardian, 17. Other Relative, 18.\nAssociate, 19. Adult Currently Living With You\u201d.  The Applicant failed to list any brothers\nor sisters.  As stated above, she has seven siblings.  \nOne of her brothers resides in Pakistan.  The Applicant stated that her brother\nvisited Pakistan in 2007.  At the time, of his visit, his intention was to stay for a few\nweeks.  He later decided to extend his visit because his wife and his daughters wanted\n\n3\nto spend more time with their grandparents.  Currently, the Applicant\u2019s brother is still\nresiding in Pakistan, but he plans on returning to the USA in the near future.  Applicant\nclaims that she was unaware of her brothers plans to extend his visit and contends that\nhe is simply a long-term visitor.  She states that she last had contact with him in June\n2009, and that she is unaware of his activities in Pakistan. \nThe Applicant completed Foreign Influence Interrogatories in April 2009, issued\nto her by the Department of Defense, in which she was required to reply to the following\nquestion: \u201c9. Do you have any immediate family member (spouse, father, mother, sons,\ndaughters, brothers, sisters), other relative (including in-laws), cohabitant, friend, or\nbusiness or professional associate who is a citizen of a foreign country, or who lives in a\nforeign country?\u201d  The Applicant responded \u201cNO\u201d.  This was a false answer.  The\nApplicant has a brother who lives in Pakistan.  (Government Exhibit 10).       \nThe Applicant claims that when she completed the security clearance application\nand the interrogatories, she thought her brother was still residing in the United States.\nShe states that she never intentionally falsified any information on the security\nclearance application.  She claims that she did not disclose the existence of her siblings\nbecause she no longer has contact with them and did not have information about them.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, I find this behavior unconvincing and not worthy\nof belief.  In fact, at the time that the Applicant provided the answer to the security\nclearance application and to the interrogatories, in April 2009, the Applicant\u2019s brother\nhad been living in Pakistan for two years, since 2007.  I find that the Applicant\nintentionally and deliberately failed to disclose her siblings on the security clearance\napplication and in her interrogatories because she thought that the information might\njeopardize her chances of obtaining a security clearance.      \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the country of\nPakistan.  Pakistan is a low-income country, with a population that is 97% Muslim.  It\nhas a coalition government led by Prime Minister Yousef Gilani and President Asif Ali\nZardari, widower of assassinated Pakistan People\u2019s Party leader Benazir Bhutto.\nAlthough Pakistan was one of only three countries to recognize the Taliban regime of\nAfghanistan, after September 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with the\nTaliban and pledged support to the U. S. and international coalition in Operation\nEnduring Freedom to remove the Taliban from power.  Despite this support, members\nof the Taliban are known to be in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of\nPakistan and in the Balochistan Province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan.  The\nleader of the Taliban, Mullah Omar, is operating openly in Pakistan.  Extremists led by\nPakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban \u201cTTP) commander Baitullah Mehsuc and other al-\nQaida extremists have re-exerted their hold over areas in the FATA and the North West\nFrontier Province (NWFP).  The TTP has gained support by promising to fill a vacuum\nleft by ineffective governments structures.  Streams of Taliban financing crossing the\nborder of Pakistan to Afghanistan has allowed the insurgency in Afghanistan to\nstrengthen its military and technical capabilities.    \nIn addition to the Taliban, the FATA in Pakistan continues to prove vital\nsanctuary to al-Qaida and a number of foreign and Pakistan-based extremist groups.\nThe security situation in Afghanistan continued to worsen in 2008, including an increase\nin al-Qaida\u2019s presence to levels unseen since 2001-2002, driven in part by insurgent\n\n4\naccess to safe havens in western Pakistan through the porous Afghan-Pakistan border.\nAl-Qaida exploits the permissive operating environment to support the Afghan\ninsurgency while also planning attacks against the U.S. and Western interests in\nPakistan and worldwide.  Together with the Afghan Taliban and other extremists\ngroups, al-Qaida uses this sanctuary to train and recruit operatives, plan and prepare\nregional and transnational attacks, disseminate propaganda and obtain equipment and\nsupplies.\nThe Pakistan Government has a poor human rights record.  Reported human\nrights problems in Pakistan include extrajudicial killings, torture and rape by security\nforces, lack of judicial independence, arbitrary arrest, wide-spread corruption,\ndisappearance and imprisonment of political opponents, and trafficking in women and\nchildren.  Pakistan creates concern for the United States because of weapon\ntechnology transfers and weapon technology cooperation with certain countries.\nPakistan has also supplied nuclear technology to Iran and Libya and sought assistance\nfrom both North Korea and China for its own weapons programs.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7. (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\n\n5\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.(a) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities;\n16.(b) Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative. \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\n\n6\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct)  that establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown\nbetween Applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation that demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant, who was born in Pakistan, has foreign\nfamily ties in Pakistan, a brother.  It is not clear from the evidence presented as to\nwhether her relationship with her brother in Pakistan is close or continuing and why he\nmade such an odd change in plans.  She states that she rarely communicates with her\nbrother or with any of her siblings for that matter.  However, she has been protective\nand not candid about their existence.  Her unwillingness to disclose her brother\u2019s name\nand later his residency in Pakistan is troubling and indicates potential dishonesty, lack of\ntrustworthiness and reliability. Given these facts, there is cause for concern in this case.\nThe Applicant has not been truthful or candid in answering the questions about\nher relatives, and given this strange and suspicious behavior, there may be something\nshe is trying to hide from the Government.  Thus, she may be in a vulnerable position\nand subject to coercion, exploitation and/or pressure by the Pakistani government.  It is\nalso noted that the current political situation in Pakistan elevates the cause for concern\nin this case. Pakistan creates concern for the United States because of weapon\ntechnology transfers and weapon technology cooperation with certain countries.\nPakistan has also supplied nuclear technology to Iran and Libya and sought assistance\nfrom both North Korea and China for its own weapons programs.  In this case, the\npossibilities are great that the Applicant may at some point be placed in a position to be\nforced to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the United States.          \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe Mitigating Conditions apply.  In this case, Applicant\u2019s brother in Pakistan, and the\nmystery that surrounds his existence, and her other siblings, creates a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation, and she may become subject to foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is a possibility of\nforeign influence that exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  Thus, I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to\nforeign influence.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence).\nThe evidence further shows that the Applicant intentionally and deliberately\nfalsified her security clearance application and her responses to interrogatories\nconcealing the fact that she has seven siblings, one of whom resides in Pakistan.\nApplicant has provided no convincing evidence to establish that any mitigating condition\napplies.  Had Applicant disclosed the existence of her siblings on her security clearance\napplication and in response to the interrogatories, and indicated that her brother has\nresided in Pakistan for the past two years, her assertions that she is unaware of his\n\n8\nactivities in Pakistan would have greater weight.  However, given the Applicant\u2019s\nquestionable behavior, the Applicant cannot be trusted with the national secrets.  \n \nUnder Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions 16.(a) The deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities, and 16.(b) Deliberately providing false or misleading information\nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.  I find the Applicant has not been truthful or candid\nwith the Government concerning her siblings and therefore cannot be trusted with the\nnational secrets.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nFurthermore, there is no evidence in support of mitigation under the whole\nperson analysis.  The Applicant has submitted no favorable recommendations or\nsufficient documentation to support security clearance eligibility.  I have considered the\n\u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth\nunder all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\npoor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack a candor, and an unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guidelines B and E of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the\nDirective.  Accordingly, she has failed to meet her ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuidelines B and E.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n2.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n2.b.: Against the Applicant\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

After reviewing the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \n \n 1  \nSeptember 21, 2009\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn April 13, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2  \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR signed and notarized on May \n4, 2009, in which he admitted to all allegations in the Statement of Reasons, \nexcept allegations 1.a. and 1.b. under Guideline G. He also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nMay 28, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on the following day. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on June 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on June 24, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, the Department Counsel offered 18 exhibits, which \nwere marked and admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 18.3  \nApplicant testified and presented the testimony of two witnesses. He offered four \nexhibits, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on July 7, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations, as well as those in \nresponse to the DOHA interrogatories, are admitted as fact. After a thorough \nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 27 years old, is unmarried and has no children. He received an \nAssociate of Arts degree in graphic design in 2005, and is currently continuing \nhis education in graphics. In his capacity as a multimedia specialist for a defense \ncontractor, he volunteered to work in Iraq from September to December 2007. He \nhas no held a security clearance in the past (GE 1; Tr. 41, 62-67). \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in \nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations \nin which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant testified that GE 3 is his adoption of the summary of his December 2006 Subject \nInterview contained in GE 2 (Tr. 90-91). \n\n \n 3  \n \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol use. When he began drinking, \nhe did it to keep up with his friends. When he was drinking alcohol regularly, he \nwould become intoxicated every few days after consuming four to five drinks. In \n2004, he was terminated from a job for repeatedly missing work after drinking \nand failing to call in to explain his absence. Applicant has had no alcohol-related \nemployment issues since that time. In May 2006, he was charged with Public \nIntoxication. He was placed in a \u201cdrunk tank,\u201d stayed overnight in the adult \ndetention center and paid a fine. Shortly after, Applicant's parents and a friend \ntalked to him about his alcohol consumption, and told him that they were \nconcerned about his health and safety. Applicant continued drinking excessively, \nand experienced blackouts from two to three times in 2006, with the last time \nbeing October 2006 (GE 2, 4, 5; Tr. 51; 68-78).  \n \nApplicant does not currently abstain from alcohol, but has reduced his \nconsumption in the past year. In 2007, he described his alcohol use as two or \nthree drinks about two times per week. In November 2008, he described his \nusage as two drinks, two to three times per month, as well as one or two \ninstances per year when he consumes five or more drinks. He also noted that he \ncan consume one alcoholic beverage without feeling intoxicated. He clarified this \ndescription at the hearing, stating that, \u201cConsuming two drinks at a time or at \nleast in one sitting, I generally wait an hour to an hour and a half at which point I \nwould not be intoxicated. So that statement seems to have been taken out of \ncontext.\u201d He also testified, \u201cafter one drink I can feel the effects of alcohol, but I \nwouldn't consider myself intoxicated\u201c and that he becomes intoxicated after \nconsuming four or five drinks. He was last intoxicated in fall 2007. He abstained \nfrom alcohol use during the three months he worked in Iraq between September \n2007 and December 2007, and continued to abstain until March 2008. He was \n\u201chappier and more upbeat\u201d when he did not consume alcohol. Currently, he sees \nthe friends with whom he drank alcohol about two to three times per year, and \ndoes not drink alcohol when he does see them. He now consumes two drinks, \nabout once per month. He has reduced his alcohol consumption because \u201cIt was \naffecting my life in negative ways. It was making things difficult to accomplish, \ncertain goals that I had set forth for myself.\u201d He has not sought alcohol \ncounseling and does not believe that he has ever had an alcohol problem (GE 4, \n5; Tr. 51-53, 62, 71-72, 104-105, 110). \n \n \nApplicant also used illegal drugs for seven years. He started using \nmarijuana in approximately 1999, when he was in high school. Until 2002, he \nused it when friends shared it with him, about twice per year. Between 2002 and \n2003, while in college, he increased his use to daily consumption. About every \nother month during this period, he purchased marijuana from a dealer for his own \nuse, and sometimes to sell to friends. He was stopped for speeding in August \n2003 and was found to have marijuana in his car. He stated in his interrogatory \nresponse that during his \u201c\u2026heaviest usage of marijuana, I frequently drank at the \nsame time.\u201d However, at the hearing, Applicant denied mixing the two often, and \nsaid it happened only a few times. Between 2002 and 2004, Applicant used \n\n \n 4  \n                                                     \nmarijuana frequently during breaks at work to alleviate boredom. He tried to stop \nusing the drug, and did decrease his use in 2003 to about two times per week. \nBetween 2003 and 2004, Applicant's mother and sister discussed his drug use \nwith him, and in 2004, they told him they were concerned about it and worried \nthat he would \u201cget into trouble.\u201d Nevertheless, between 2004 to early 2006, he \ncontinued to smoke marijuana approximately once or twice per month. During his \nsecurity interview, he told the investigator that he believes he was dependent on \nmarijuana because he craved it. At the hearing, he testified that he used \nmarijuana heavily until summer 2005. He then tried to reduce his usage in an \neffort to quit entirely. Both in his interview and at the hearing, he said that his last \nuse was in May 2006. In the summer of 2007, he was with a friend who used \nmarijuana, but Applicant did not use it (GE 3, 4, 6; Tr. 53-54, 76, 82-87, 94, 107-\n109).  \n \n \nApplicant used other illegal drugs as well. Between July 2004 and early \n2005, Applicant snorted powder cocaine four times. He did not purchase the \ndrug, but received it from friends. Applicant did buy LSD on three occasions, and \nused it a total of five times between 2002 and 2005. Applicant also used opium \nthree to six times per year between 2003 and 2004. He used Ecstasy as well, \nusually purchasing it at clubs. He listed his Ecstasy use in his November 2008 \ninterrogatory response as once or twice per year from 2000 to 2003, but at the \nhearing described it as twice in 2000, followed by a two-year abstinence, and \nthen occasionally between 2002 and 2005. Applicant also illegally used Ritalin \nseven to eleven times from 2004 to 2005, without a doctor\u2019s prescription. He \nknew that using marijuana and the other drugs was illegal, but the illegality did \nnot bother him because, \u201cI was young, felt I was bigger than the world and \nthought that I could live my life the way I felt.\u201d He has not participated in drug \ncounseling, Narcotics Anonymous, or similar groups. He does not believe he \never had a drug problem because he was able to stop using illegal drugs and has \nnot had a craving for them. Applicant does not associate with people who use \ndrugs, and has no intent to use illegal drugs in the future (GE 3, 4, 6; Tr. 82-89, \n102, 104). \n \nOver the seven years from 2001 through 2008, Applicant was cited for six \ntraffic violations.4 They include failure to yield, failure to obey signs, improper U \nturn, use of the restricted high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane, and three \nspeeding citations. None of the violations involved alcohol or illegal drugs. \nApplicant testified that these infractions were primarily the result of his failure \u201cto \npull his foot off the gas.\u201d The citation for failure to obey a sign resulted from \nApplicant's driving at an unsafe speed for the weather conditions. The offense for \nfailure to yield right of way caused an accident in which Applicant was \ndetermined to be at fault (GE 7-13; Tr. 98-99, 111-112).  \n \n \n4 Applicant disclosed at hearing that he received an additional traffic citation for speeding in \nJanuary 2009. This citation is not alleged in the SOR (Tr. 98-99). \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \n \nApplicant's personal representative testified that she has known Applicant \nfor three years, including two years as his roommate. She did not know him when \nhe used illegal drugs and excessive alcohol, and has not seen him indulge in \nthose activities since she has known him. She believes that he has become more \nmature in his choice of lifestyle and friends. She holds a security clearance and \nwould not associate with anyone who was engaged in questionable activities. \nShe found him trustworthy to the point that she agreed to be his roommate. \nApplicant's manager testified that she has known him since 2006 when he \nstarted working at their company. He is an excellent employee and a hard worker \nwho has worked through the night when required. She is unaware of the \nallegations related to illegal drugs and excessive alcohol use. Applicant offered a \ncharacter reference from a retired U.S. Army major who cited Applicant's \nwillingness to volunteer to work in Iraq, and his outstanding job performance. He \nalso opined that Applicant's \u201cyouthful indiscretions\u201d should not prevent him from \nobtaining a security clearance. Applicant's direct supervisor during the Iraq \nassignment also attested to Applicant's talent, excellent contributions to the \nmission, and willingness to work overtime to produce outstanding products. (AE \nC, D; Tr. 25-31, 40-48). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-\nsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect \nconsideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred \nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under Guidelines G, H, and E at AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. \nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \n \n5 Directive 6.3 \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n 6  \n                                                     \nthe SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure \nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under Guideline G are relevant to the facts: \nAG \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) and AG \u00b6 22(c) (habitual or binge \nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether \nthe individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent). \nApplicant's use of alcohol has resulted in intoxication every few days at its \nheaviest, job termination, concern and warnings from his family, and repeated \nblackouts. His 2004 failures to report to work or his absences, as well as the \ncharge of public intoxication in 2006, indicate that his judgment was impaired \nbecause of his alcohol consumption. Both disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline includes factors that can mitigate disqualifying conduct. AG \n\u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does \nnot cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply. Applicant engaged in heavy alcohol use in the past to \nthe point where he was becoming intoxicated every few days, and sometimes \nexperienced blackouts. Although he has moderated his drinking, it is not in the \ndistant past because he continues to drink. AG \u00b6 23(b) (the individual \nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 7  \nevidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a \npattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol \nabuser) is also relevant. Applicant has moderated his drinking in the past year. It \nshould be noted, however, that in November 2008, he stated that his \nconsumption involved drinking an intoxicating level of alcohol (five or more \ndrinks) one or two times per year. Moreover, Applicant showed a lack of maturity \nby continuing to drink alcohol to excess after his family told him that they were \nconcerned about it. Although he does not drink with them, he still sees his friends \nseveral times per year with whom he drank alcohol. Finally, Applicant has not \nacknowledged his alcohol issues, as he does not believe that his level of alcohol \nconsumption constituted a problem. This lack of acknowledgement and \nawareness, despite the evidence\u2014his job termination, blackouts, his night in a \n\u201cdrunk tank,\u201d his family\u2019s concerns\u2014raises doubts as to his current judgment, \nand questions as to whether this conduct will recur. AG \u00b6 23(b) cannot be \napplied. I find against Applicant on Guideline G. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness both \nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions are relevant under Guideline H: AG \u00b6 25(a) \n(any drug abuse) and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. During the period from 1999 to 2006, Applicant purchased, \npossessed, used and sold marijuana. Between 2000 and 2005, he also used \nother illegal drugs to a lesser extent. He purchased, possessed, and used LSD \nand ecstacy; and possessed and used cocaine, opium, and unprescribed Ritalin. \nBoth disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThree of the four mitigating conditions under Guideline H relate to the \nfacts. AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \ncannot be applied. Although Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana was approximately \nthree years ago, his use was quite frequent, at times daily, and extended over a \nperiod of seven years. Applicant had a long-standing habit of marijuana use and \nat times it was part of his daily life. In addition, Applicant not only used illegal \ndrugs, but purchased them, and in the case of marijuana, he sold them as well. \nHis willingness not only to use, but to purchase and sell illegal drugs casts doubt \non his trustworthiness and undercuts application of this mitigating condition. \n\n \n 8  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is also relevant: a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs \nin the future, such as:  \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(4) does not apply as Applicant did not offer a signed statement of \nintent. However, AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) applies because Applicant has abstained from \nusing marijuana and other illegal drugs for approximately three years. AG \u00b6 26(c) \n(abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which \nthese drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended) does not apply \nbecause Applicant repeatedly used a prescription drug that was prescribed for \nhis friend and not for him. Given the length of time Applicant used illegal drugs, \nthe wide variety that he indulged in, his willingness to engage in the illegal \nconduct of not only using but buying and selling illegal drugs, I find that the \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26 (b)(3) is insufficient to overcome Applicant\u2019s \ndisqualifying conduct. I find against Applicant on Guideline H. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, AG \u00b6 16(d) is relevant: \n \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or \nother characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \n\n \n 9  \n                                                     \nsafeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to \nconsideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include \nbreach of client confidentiality, release of proprietary \ninformation, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate \nor other government protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in \nthe workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and, \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or \nother employer's time or resources. \n \n \nSOR allegations 3.b. through 3.g. comprise a series of traffic infractions \nwhich, taken individually, would not rise to the level of security significance. \nHowever, Applicant has violated traffic regulations six times in seven years.9  \nThese recurrent violations demonstrate a history of ignoring rules and \nregulations. Taken together, a pattern emerges that demonstrates Applicant's \nwillingness to place his own desires ahead of the rule of law. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) \napplies. \n \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(c) is relevant (the offense is so minor, or so \nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Several years have \npassed since Applicant's series of civil infractions began in 2001. However, \nApplicant has not ceased this pattern. The most recent violation that was alleged \nin the SOR was in November 2008, just ten months ago. Given the recency of \nthis infraction, and that it happens in a frequently occurring situation of driving his \nautomobile, I cannot confidently predict that it will not recur. In addition, these \nfrequent violations demonstrate Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations and raise doubts about his good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) \ncannot be applied. I find against Applicant on Guideline E. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and \nhave applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have \n \n9 Applicant's 2009 violation was not alleged. It will only be considered as part of the whole person \nanalysis. \n\n \n \n10 \n \nalso reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the \nappropriate guidelines, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nApplicant engaged in alcohol abuse over several years that resulted in \nfrequent intoxication, several black-outs, and an arrest for public intoxication. His \nbehavior worried his family, who asked him in 2006 to moderate his alcohol use. \nHe ignored their concerns, and did not change his behavior for two more years. \nApplicant also used numerous illegal drugs, starting in 1999. Applicant's \ninvolvement with marijuana was the most extensive. He used it for seven years, \nat times, daily. He not only used it, but purchased and sold it. He used four other \nillegal drugs, as well as a prescription drug that was not prescribed for him. His \nlast use of an illegal drug occurred in 2006, when he was not an adolescent but \napproximately 24 years old. Each time he used these drugs, he demonstrated a \ndisregard for rule and regulations, and a willingness to place his own desires \nabove the rule of law. \n \n \n Applicant has made commendable changes in his life. He ended his \nillegal drug use in 2006, and has moderated his alcohol use within the past year. \nHowever, to evaluate Applicant's behavior as a whole, his civil infractions must \nalso be considered. The most recent infraction that was listed in the SOR \noccurred in 2008. He admitted at hearing that he also received another speeding \nviolation in January 2009, about eight months ago. This violation occurred after \nhe had received and completed several interrogatories and was aware that his \neligibility for a security clearance was being assessed. His violation indicates \neither a lack of awareness or a disregard for the responsibilities entailed in \nholding a security clearance. Applicant's repeated infractions form a pattern that \ncannot be ignored. They stem from the same underlying impulse to disregard the \nlaw that Applicant displayed when he used illegal drugs. Access to classified \ninformation imposes an obligation to adhere to laws and regulations, and it \ncannot be granted to one who is unwilling to accept that obligation.  \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the cited \nadjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by \nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.h. \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a. - 2.k. \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 3.a - 3.g. \n \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn April 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 13, 2009 and did not request a \nhearing. On June 17, 2009, Department Counsel requested a hearing in the case before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 27, 2009. DOHA issued \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \na Notice of Hearing on August 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nSeptember 23, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. Applicant did not \nobject and they were admitted. Applicant offered Exhibit (AE) A which was admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. The record was held \nopen until September 30, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. \nNone were submitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September \n30, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and works as a multi-media specialist. He has worked \nfor a federal contractor since 1998, and has never held a security clearance. He \ngraduated from high school in 1996. He is not married.1  \n \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in January 1994. He used marijuana \napproximately monthly from 1994 to 1996. He used it approximately five times a week \nfrom 1997 to 2001. He used it approximately three times a week from 2001 to \nNovember 2002. He used it approximately once a month, or less, from December 2002 \nto August 2007. From August 2007 to August 2008, he used it approximately six to \ntwelve times during the year. From August 2008 to September 2009, Applicant used \nmarijuana about six to twelve times during the year. His last use of marijuana was while \ncamping with his friends, two weeks before his hearing.2 \n \n \nApplicant stated he knew drug use was illegal and he knows there is a prohibition \nof drug use by government contractors. He stated he imagined it was against his \ncompany\u2019s policy too. He does not use drugs at his home, because his girlfriend, who \nlives with him, has a seven-year-old daughter and he does not want to expose her to \ndrugs. His girlfriend does not use marijuana.3 \n \n \nApplicant indicated that his future use of marijuana was dependant upon whether \nhe was granted a security clearance. If he was granted a security clearance, he would \nabstain. He stated \u201cI would stop, if I [was] to possess a clearance, I would stop, because \nI would not want to jeopardize my clearance.\u201d4 He went on to say \u201cIt would all depend \non my clearance.\u201d5 Regarding his general intention to use marijuana in the future he \nstated he may use it at a party, if it is available. He explained that his use of marijuana \n \n1 Tr. 19-20, 22. \n \n2 Tr. 24-32. \n \n3 Tr. 31-34. \n \n4 Tr. 32. \n \n5 Tr. 33. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nis not an everyday occurrence. If he was in the right environment, he could see himself \nusing it again. He could not definitively confirm whether he would use it in the future.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, two weeks ago, was with his \u201clife-long friends.\u201d7 \nHe associates with these friends a couple of times a week. He stated he was with \u201chis \nbuddies\u201d and was \u201changing out\u201d, \u201chaving some beers\u201d, and \u201chaving a good time,\u201d when \nthey used it. He admitted his friends use marijuana on occasion.8  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he has purchased marijuana in the past and then \nprovided it to a friend. He stated in the past he has \u201cpicked up\u201d marijuana for a friend. \nHe did not profit from the purchase and transfer of marijuana to his friend. He admitted \nhe had operated a vehicle after using marijuana. He believes marijuana should be \nlegalized.9  \n \n \nApplicant stated he has used marijuana when he was working at a second job, \nbut not before going to work at his primary job with the federal contractor.10  \n \n \nApplicant experimented with other illegal drugs in the past. Between 1995 and \n1998, he snorted cocaine once. He snorted heroine once after he completed high \nschool. He also has used prescription drugs that were not prescribed to him, such as \nPercocet. He estimated that he last used the prescription drug two to three years ago, \nand he used it about 12 times. It was given to him by friends.11  \n \n \nApplicant stated when he completed his security clearance application (SCA) he \ncompleted the question on the application that asked about his past drug use. He \nthought perhaps his drug use would prohibit him from obtaining a security clearance. \nWhen he was interviewed in August 2008, he also became aware that drug use might \nbe an issue.12 \n \n \nApplicant is aware that drug use is illegal, but considers it similar to speeding. He \ndoes not feel his use of marijuana would ever be used to compromise him and it never \nprevented him from doing a good job. He stated he is able to function under stress and \nis a good problem-solver. He believes his employer is aware of his drug use. Some \npeople at work and those that work in the security division advised him that he should \n \n6 Tr. 32-34, 44. \n \n7 Tr. 46. \n \n8 Tr. 31, 46-47. \n \n9 Tr. 35-38. \n \n10 Tr. 38-40. \n \n11 Tr. 35-36, 40-44; I have not considered for disqualifying purposes Applicant\u2019s other illegal drug \nuse that was not alleged, but have considered it when analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n \n12 Tr. 20-24, 47-50. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nstop using drugs. He believes the main problem with his drug use is if were to be \nstopped by the police with marijuana in his possession.13  \n \n \nApplicant has participated in drug rehabilitation and does not believe he is \naddicted to marijuana. He does not consider his drug use a problem. He believes drug \nuse is common and he only knows a \u201chandful of people\u201d14 that have never used \nmarijuana. He considers himself a man of high integrity. He understands he has no \nexcuse for breaking the law. He is dedicated to his craft and describes himself as \nfocused on pride, honor and integrity. He pays his bill on time. He owns his own house, \ntruck, and motorcycle. He emphasized that he answered all of the drug questions on his \nSCA honestly, explaining his past drug use.15  \n \n \nA character witness, who testified on behalf of Applicant, has known him for nine \nto ten years. At one time he was Applicant\u2019s supervisor. He holds a security clearance \nand trusts Applicant. He does not believe Applicant can be coerced into doing anything \nhe does not want to do. He believes Applicant is honest. He was aware of Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use in the past, but was unaware of the extent of it. He confirmed that illegal drug \nuse is a violation of their employer\u2019s policy. He has not observed Applicant use illegal \ndrugs.16 A character letter Applicant provided stated that he has demonstrated an ability \nto be placed in positions of trust and responsibility. He is considered a great problem-\nsolver. He is also a valued and trusted asset who has the ability to secure confidential \ninformation.17  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n \n13 Tr. 47-52. \n \n14  Tr. 55. \n \n15 Tr. 55-63. \n \n16 Tr. 67-75. \n \n17 AE A. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the disqualifying conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25, and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs from 1994 through September 2009, and most \nrecently two weeks before his hearing. He has purchased illegal drugs in the past for his \nown use and for others. He may use illegal drugs in the future, depending on the \ncircumstances of his environment. He will not use illegal drugs if he is granted a security \nclearance. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have considered all of the evidence in this case and the mitigating conditions \nunder Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 26, and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant has used marijuana, an illegal substance, from 1994 through \nSeptember 2009. His last use was with \u201clife-long friends.\u201d He continues to associate \nwith friends who use illegal drugs. He stated that his continuance of drug use is \ncontingent upon obtaining a security clearance He has shown an unwillingness to abide \nby the law. His illegal drug use is recent and frequent, and based on his admissions, \nlikely to recur. He has not demonstrated an intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. \nHe has not abstained from illegal drug use and did not offer a signed statement of his \nintention to refrain from drug use, subject to automatic revocation of a clearance for any \nviolation. The burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by his \nillegal drug use. He did not provide sufficient evidence meet his burden. Applicant\u2019s \ndrug use casts doubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nfind mitigating conditions (a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant used marijuana two weeks prior to his hearing and after he had \nsubmitted a SCA. I find that his behavior and conduct demonstrate questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. I find that the above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17, and especially considered the following: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhen Applicant submitted a SCA, he was aware that drug abuse was a security \nconcern. Despite that knowledge, he continued to use illegal drugs while his SCA was \npending. I find that his behavior casts doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Therefore, I find that mitigating condition (c) does not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s former supervisor and \ncoworker consider him honest and trustworthy. Applicant has a long history of illegal \ndrug use. He continued to use illegal drugs after he completed his SCA and two weeks \nprior to his hearing, which shows poor judgment. He has not demonstrated an intent not \nto use illegal drugs in the future nor has he disassociated himself from those with whom \nhe uses drugs. I find the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d is redundant with \u00b6 1.a and 2.a.Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under the guidelines for Drug Involvement and \nPersonal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant relied on consumer credit cards to pay for living expenses during a\nperiod of inconsistent employment from May 2002 until September 2005. As of\nNovember 2009, he owed delinquent credit card debt of about $22,911 and 2007\nfederal and state income taxes totaling about $6,346. He is making regular payments on\nhis income tax debt, but financial concerns are not fully mitigated. He has yet to address\nhis credit card delinquencies, and he has no discretionary income despite an annual\nsalary of $72,000. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on June 18, 2008. On July 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and to refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nMay 7, 2010\n\n2\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn August 17, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on September 15, 2009, to conduct a hearing and to\ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On October 16, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for\nNovember 5, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Five Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and\nthree Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted into evidence without an objection.\nApplicant and three witnesses testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on\nNovember 18, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open for additional documentation until\nNovember 20, 2009. On November 18, 2009, Applicant submitted four documents that\nwere entered as exhibits D through G without an objection.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that Applicant owes\ncredit card debt totaling $22,911 (SOR 1.a and 1.b), federal taxes of about $9,327.24\n(SOR 1.c) and state (hereafter, state X) taxes of $1,280 (SOR 1.d). Applicant admitted\nthe debts. However, the balance owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had been\nreduced through interception of his income tax refund for 2008, and by monthly\npayments of $147. He also was paying $50 per month to state X. He explained that he\nrelied on consumer credit cards to cover living expenses while unemployed from May\n2002 until September 2005. The tax debts were incurred because his ex-wife claimed\ntheir son as a dependent on her income tax returns and he had to pay taxes on about\n$10,000 in credit card debt that had been cancelled by a creditor. After considering the\npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following factual findings.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old college graduate, who has worked as a senior quality\ncontrol engineer for his current employer, a defense contractor, since June 2007. (Ex. 1)\nHe was granted an interim secret-level security clearance for his duties in June 2008. It\nwas withdrawn on issuance of the SOR (Tr. 26-27.) Applicant has custody of a teenage\nson, who was born to him and his ex-wife in June 1996. Applicant and his ex-wife were\ndivorced by order dated March 31, 2009, after 26 years of marriage. (Ex. 1, C.)\nFrom September 1987 to February 1998, Applicant worked as a senior engineer\nfor a computer manufacturer. In early 1998, Applicant\u2019s work unit was sold. Applicant\nstayed on with a new employer in the position of test engineer at a salary of about\n$60,000 annually. (Tr. 56.) He was laid off in May 2002. (Ex. 1, 2, 3, Tr. 56.) \nApplicant had no full-time employment from May 2002 to September 2005. He\ncollected unemployment compensation of about $500 weekly from May 2002 to\n\nApplicant testified that his income went from $60,000 per year to between $5,000 and $6,000 per\n1\nyear. (Tr. 56.)\n3\nFebruary 2003. (Tr. 98-99.) He then worked sporadically as a substitute teacher, as a\nnewspaper delivery person, and as a landscaper (Tr. 55, 98.), but his earnings were\ninsufficient to cover the family\u2019s expenses.  For two years, he earned less than $6,000\n1\nannually. (Tr. 101) His ex-wife worked only about 15 hours per week. (Tr. 55.) Applicant\nand his ex-wife relied on consumer credit cards that they had taken out jointly to cover\nsome expenses such as groceries and gasoline. (Ex. 1, 2.) Eventually, they were\nunable to make even the minimum payments on some of their accounts. (Tr. 97.) In\nNovember 2003, a past due credit card balance of $8,800 was charged off by a bank\nand sold to a collection agency (SOR 1.b). In February 2004, their joint account with a\ncredit union, that they had held since November 1988, was charged off in the amount of\n$11,074 (not alleged). The following month, the credit card lender identified in SOR 1.a\ncancelled their account for nonpayment of a $12,663 balance. (Ex. 2, 5.) The creditor\nrefused to make any accommodations concerning repayment while Applicant was\nunemployed. (Tr. 73.) In May 2005, Applicant paid a bankruptcy attorney about $500,\nbut he never completed the paperwork to file a bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 74-75.)\nApplicant worked as a project engineer for a pharmaceutical company on a one-\nyear contract from September 2005 to September 2006. He was paid about $70,000 in\nwages. (Ex. 1, 2, Tr. 55-56.) Applicant did not incur any new credit card debt, but he\nalso made no payments on the credit card debts charged off or placed for collection.\nOut of work through the fall of 2006, Applicant accepted a contract position at $55 per\nhour with his present employer starting in January 2007. (Tr. 96.) At the end of three to\nsix months working in state X, he was promised a full-time position in state Y. In April\n2007, his ex-wife resigned from her part-time job in state X in anticipation of their\nrelocation. In June 2007, Applicant started working full-time with the company in state Y\nat an annual salary of $69,000. (Tr. 96.) Two days before Applicant\u2019s start date,\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife told Applicant that she would not move, and that she wanted a\ndivorce. (Ex. 2, Tr. 58.)\nApplicant began a protracted and costly custody battle over his son, who wanted\nto live with him in state Y. (Tr. 58.) He spent about $800 per month traveling between\nstates Y and X to see his son, in addition to paying separate living expenses (housing,\ngroceries, utility costs) for himself in state Y and for his ex-wife and son in state X. (Tr.\n58-59, 105-06.) In October 2007, Applicant filed for divorce. (Ex. C.) In November 2007,\nhe was ordered to pay child support, which he complied with by paying his ex-wife\u2019s rent\nat $1,200 per month. Beginning in January 2008, Applicant was also required to pay\nalimony to his ex-wife at $140 weekly. (Ex. 2, 3, Tr. 58-59.) Because of these expenses,\nApplicant did not have the funds to make payments on the delinquent credit card debts\naccumulated during the marriage. (Ex. 2.)\nIn January 2008, Applicant was notified by the IRS that his federal taxable\nincome for 2007 had increased by $11,074 because the credit union had cancelled\n(\u201cforgiven\u201d) his delinquent credit card balance. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife then filed her income\ntax returns for tax year 2007 as married filing separately, and she claimed their son as a\n\nIn his summary of Applicant\u2019s interview, the government investigator indicated that Applicant owed\n2\n$10,000 in federal taxes, $250 in state Y taxes, and $1,200 in state X taxes for tax year 2007. (Ex. 2)\nDocumentation submitted by Applicant to DOHA in January 2009 showed tax debts of $198.28 to state X and\n$1,279.51 to state Y (Ex. 3). But the same firm collecting the state Y tax debt indicated in a letter of October\n9, 2009, that payments totaling $276.89 represented payment in full. (Ex. E.) Furthermore, Applicant provided\ncopies of payments by check at $50 monthly from December 2008 through October 2009 (Ex. G.) to state X\nwhich would substantiate that state X and not state Y was owed the higher balance.\nApplicant recognized the debt under the name of the original lender rather than the collection agency\n3\nalleged in SOR 1.b.\n4\ndependent on her returns. Consequently, Applicant was allowed to claim only himself as\nan exemption on an adjusted gross income of $103,734. He ended up owing about\n$10,000 in federal taxes, $276 in state Y taxes, and $1,280 in state X taxes for tax year\n2007.  (Ex. 2, 3, D, Tr. 59-60.)\n2\nOn June 18, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to the\nfinancial record inquiries, but he added that he had some financial difficulties while\nunemployed. He answered \u201cYes\u201d to questions 28.a, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28.b, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d and disclosed that he owed $25,000 in delinquent credit\ncard debt. (Ex. 1.)\nOn July 22, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis financial issues. He admitted owing delinquent credit card balances of about\n$12,663 (SOR 1.a) and $8,800 (SOR 1.b).  He admitted that one creditor (SOR 1.b) had\n3\npursued collection, but he did not have the funds to satisfy the debt. Applicant estimated\nhis federal and state tax debts totaled $11,450 for tax year 2007, although he and his\nex-wife were scheduled for mediation in August 2008, in part over their joint tax liability.\nDue to his support payments for her rent and alimony, Applicant was living from\npaycheck to paycheck. (Ex. 2.) At a court hearing on November 4, 2008, Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife indicated she had no intention of repaying any of their marital debt. (Ex. 2.)\nIn August 2008, Applicant was granted physical custody of his son, who joined\nhim in state Y. Applicant was no longer obligated to pay his ex-wife\u2019s rent, but alimony\npayments to her continued at $140 per week. Between September 2008 and January\n2009, Applicant spent $100 every other week to take his son to his ex-wife for visits.\n(Ex. 2.) His ex-wife has not seen their son since then. (Tr. 61.)\nIn December 2008, Applicant began repaying his $9,327.24 debt to the IRS at\n$147 per month, his $1,280 debt to state X at $50 per month, and his $276.89 debt to\nstate Y at $30 per month. (Ex. 3, D, G, E, F.) In response to DOHA financial\ninterrogatories, Applicant indicated on January 8, 2009, that he was pursuing his\nspouse for half of the credit card and tax debts since they were incurred during their\nmarriage. (Ex. 3.) In late January 2009, Applicant was informed by state X that he owed\nan additional $198.28 in state X taxes (Ex. 3), apparently following an audit of a return\nfiled before 2007. (Ex. D, Tr. 92.)\n\nApplicant indicates he was divorced in April 2009. The judge\u2019s order was dated March 31, 2009. (Ex.\n4\nC.) It is unclear when the judgment of divorce was filed.\n5\n When Applicant filed his 2008 federal income tax return in March 2009, he\nclaimed his son as a dependent. His return was rejected by the IRS because his ex-wife\nhad already claimed their son on her return. Applicant filed a dispute with the IRS, and\nhe proved that he was entitled to an exemption. It resulted in a tax overpayment that the\nIRS intercepted and applied to his 2007 tax debt. (Ex. 2, D, Tr. 103.)\nApplicant was granted a divorce from his ex-wife by court order dated March 31,\n2009.  Between legal and guardian fees, he spent about $15,000 to gain custody of his\n4\nson and to divorce his ex-wife. (Tr. 78.) He paid less than half of that amount from his\nfunds. The rest was gifted to him by a family member. (Tr. 79-80.) Beginning April 3,\n2009, Applicant was entitled to child support payments of $25 weekly from his ex-wife,\nwho was employed part-time at a public library. (Tr. 69-70.) She was also ordered to\npay half of their son\u2019s out-of-pocket medical costs. Applicant was ordered to continue\nalimony payments to his ex-wife, at $150 per week, and he was held solely responsible\nfor repaying the marital debts. (Ex. C, Tr. 71.)\nIn April 2009, Applicant took out a vehicle loan of $8,757, to be repaid at $174\nper month, for a 2002 model-year vehicle. (Ex. 4, Tr. 76) He borrowed $8,000 from a\nfamily member that he put toward the car and he financed the remainder. (Tr. 77.) The\nbalances of his outstanding credit card delinquencies continued to mount. As of May\n2009, the creditor in SOR 1.a was claiming an unpaid balance of $14,134. (Ex. 4.)\n As of October 2009, the balance of his federal tax debt was $5,418.41, after the\ninterception of his 2008 refund and his monthly payments of $147 since December\n2008. (Ex. F). Applicant had paid off his state Y tax debt as of October 9, 2009. (Ex. D,\nE.) He had paid $550 toward his state X tax delinquency. (Ex. G.) Applicant has been\nmaking timely payments on his living expenses, including an automobile loan, since his\ndivorce (Tr. 60.), with the exception of his cable television bill from December 2007. He\nbelieves it \"got lost in the holiday shuffle.\" He was paying a little extra each month to\ncover the debt. (Tr. 111.) He has not used any credit cards since 2005. (Tr. 64.) He has\nmade no effort to repay the credit card delinquencies in SOR 1.a and 1.b, or to repay\nthe interest-free loan for his car (Tr. 78), because he does not have the funds. He\nintends to make repayment arrangements once his federal income tax debt is satisfied.\n(Tr. 73.) Applicant reported having no discretionary income as of November 2009 (Tr.\n76.), despite a current annual salary of $72,000. (Tr. 95.)\nApplicant has incurred about $500 in medical debt for his son since the divorce.\nAs of November 2009, his ex-wife had not paid her share of those costs. (Tr. 65-67.)\nNor has she paid him the $25 in child support per week, even though she opened a\nbookstore in June 2009. (Tr. 69.) Applicant has been timely in his alimony payments.\n(Tr. 61.) In October 2009, Applicant reported his ex-wife to state X\u2019s child support\nenforcement for noncompliance with the support order. (Tr 62-63.)\n\n6\nApplicant proved to be a quick learner and performed very well in a fast-paced\nenvironment in his current employment. He was given an overall rating of \u201cmeets\nexpectations\u201d for his performance in 2007 (Ex. A.) and in 2008 (Ex. B.) In the opinion of\nhis supervisor, Applicant was making \u201cgreat progress\u201d in learning the aspects of quality\nengineering. Applicant\u2019s productivity and timeliness were within established time frames.\nHe demonstrated a good understanding of potential ethics issues, and asked for\nguidance when issues arose. (Ex. B.) Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s facility security officer\ntestified that Applicant complied with the requirements of the National Industrial Security\nProgram Operating Manual before his interim clearance was withdrawn. (Tr. 26-27.) \nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n7\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant used credit cards to pay for living expenses during a period of\ninconsistent employment from May 2002 to September 2005. Three accounts became\nseriously delinquent in the aggregate amount of $32,537. While about $11,074 of the\ndebt was forgiven, Applicant had to pay taxes on the cancelled debt. As of the date of\nhis subject interview in July 2008, he owed about $9,327.24 in federal taxes, $1,280 in\nstate X taxes, and $276.89 in state Y taxes, in addition to credit card delinquency of at\nleast $21,440. AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\" and AG \u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d clearly apply.\nAs of November 2009, Applicant had not resolved the debts in the SOR. While\nhe had been making monthly payments toward his tax debts to the IRS and state X, and\nhad satisfied his state Y tax debt, he had made no effort to contact the creditors in SOR\n1.a and 1.b. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot\nreasonably apply where there are ongoing financial issues.\nThere is credible evidence that would implicate unemployment and inconsistent\nemployment as the primary causes of Applicant's credit card delinquencies. After he\nwas laid off in May 2002, Applicant was unable to find full-time employment until\nSeptember 2005. For two of those years, he earned less than $6,000 annually and his\nspouse worked only about 15 hours a week. Loss of employment is a mitigating\ncondition. See AG \u00b6 20(b) (stating, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). For AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply,\nApplicant must have acted responsibly once he was in a position to do so. He earned\n\n8\nabout $70,000 at contract employment with a pharmaceutical company from September\n2005 to September 2006. His neglect of the credit card debts during that time is\nunderstandable. He needed some time to regain financial stability. Applicant also had\nno guarantee of income after the one-year contract ended, and as it turned out, he was\nwithout a job until early January 2007, when he began his contract position with his\ncurrent employer at $55 per hour. While he began full-time employment at $69,000 a\nyear in June 2007, he incurred unexpected expenses of the type contemplated in AG \u00b6\n20(b) thereafter.\nApplicant and his ex-wife separated when he moved for his current employment,\nand he paid his ex-wife\u2019s living expenses as well as his own. In January 2008, he was\nordered by the divorce court to pay his ex-wife alimony at $140 per week. Applicant had\ntravel costs to visit his son as well. Later that spring, he was assessed additional tax\nliabilities of about $10,885 for 2007, in part because of the cancellation of $11,024 in\ncredit card debt incurred to support himself and his family while he lacked a full-time job,\nbut also because his ex-wife claimed their son as a dependent on her income tax\nreturns. He incurred about $15,000 in fees for his divorce and the custody battle,\nalthough he paid more than half of the fees with monies gifted to him by a family\nmember.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s financial situation should have improved after he was\ngranted primary custody of his son in August 2008. He no longer had to pay child\nsupport to his ex-wife. Travel expenses for his son to see his ex-wife ceased in January\n2009. In December 2008, he began repaying his tax debts, but the total payments were\nonly $227. While AG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability, Applicant cannot be said to have\nacted responsibly when he made no effort to contact the credit card lenders in SOR 1.a\nand 1.b after he was held solely liable for repayment on his divorce.\nAG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies in part because of Applicant's efforts to resolve his\ntax debts starting in December 2008. Due to interception of his tax refund for 2008, but\nalso because of his $147 monthly payments, he had reduced his federal income tax\ndebt to $5,418.41 as of October 2009. He had paid $550 toward his state X tax debt\nand had satisfied his state Y tax debt.\nApplicant has not received financial counseling that would qualify under AG \u00b6\n20(c), \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  However,\nhe has taken some steps to ensure no recurrence of the credit card delinquencies by\nmaintaining no active credit card accounts. Available credit reports corroborate his\ntestimony that he has not used any credit cards since his divorce. He took out a loan for\na used car in April 2009, and he has apparently been timely in his $174 monthly\npayments for the car. But it would be premature to conclude that his financial problems\nare being resolved or are under control. He is still paying for a delinquent cable\ncompany debt from December 2007. Moreover, he testified he was living from paycheck\nto paycheck, despite the fact that his salary has increased to $72,000 annually and he is\nnot paying $1,200 to his ex-wife each month. His alimony increased only slightly, from\n\n9\n$140 to $150 per week. School expenses for his son, clothing, and food do not fully\nexplain where his money has gone. It is unclear when he will be able to make payments\ntoward his $22,911 in delinquent credit card debt.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAvailable credit information reflects outstanding balances totaling about $29,257\non the debts listed in the SOR. Applicant used credit cards to support his family during a\nprolonged period of low income. Unforeseen costs related to a divorce and custody\nbattle prevented him from taking timely steps to address his delinquent credit card debts\nor the tax debts related in part to cancellation of old credit card debt.\nNothing in the Directive requires that an applicant be debt free before he can be\ngranted access. The DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-\nperson analysis in financial cases stating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a\nmatter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All\nthat is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to\nresolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant has made five months of payments on his tax debts, and he intends to resolve\nhis credit card debts. Despite an annual salary of about $72,000, he has yet to put aside\nany significant amount to address his old credit card balances, which represent $22,911\nof his outstanding delinquent debt at this point. Based on the evidence before me, I\ncannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance at this time. Should he continue to make his tax payments and begin\nto address his consumer credit debts, he may be a good candidate for a security\nclearance when again eligible a year from the date of this decision.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n10\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Two assaults were \nmisdemeanor-level offenses, and were ultimately dismissed. The 1997 assault resulted \nin a felony-level conviction. His misdemeanor-level, marijuana-related convictions in \n1989 and 1994 are not recent. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising from \nhis criminal conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 5, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1). On March 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant (GE 13). The SOR detailed the \nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant eligibility for a security clearance \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised; and the revised \nOctober 22, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct) (GE 13). The \nSOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding \nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue his security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on April 28, 2009, and the Applicant \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge (GE 14). On July 29, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed with Applicant\u2019s case. On July 29, 2009, the \ncase was assigned to me. On September 4, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. \nDepartment Counsel offered 11 exhibits (GE 1-11) (Transcript (Tr.) 17-26), and \nApplicant offered four exhibits (AE A-D) (Tr. 29-31). Applicant objected to the records \nindicating he was charged with three assaults during January to March 1997 (Tr. 17-26). \nI admitted the records showing three sets of assault charges, and explained Applicant\u2019s \nobjections would be applied to the weight given to the exhibits (Tr. 26-27). Ultimately, I \ndetermined that Applicant committed one assault in 1997. There were no other \nobjections, and I admitted AE A-D (Tr. 31). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response \nto the SOR, and Hearing Notice (GE 12-14). I held the record open until September 15, \n2009, to permit Applicant to submit additional documentation (Tr. 99-116). For example, \nI suggested Applicant could submit police reports relating to the assaults, or statements \nfrom the witness-victim of the 1997 and 2006 assaults (Tr. 114-115). Applicant did not \nsubmit any post-hearing documentation. I received the transcript on September 14, \n2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h (GE 14). He denied the remaining SOR allegations (GE 14). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old and has worked for a government contractor since May \n2008 (Tr. 5, 90-92; GE 1). He graduated from high school in 1979 (Tr. 5). He attended a \ncommunity college for a few months (Tr. 6). He has never married (Tr. 94).2 His \ndaughters are ages 29 and 21 (Tr. 96). One reason he left the mother of his children \nwas because she was verbally abusive and talked down to him (Tr. 94). About six \nmonths ago, he lost his interim security clearance, and the contractor moved him to \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n2 On August 22, 2008, Applicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Investigator that \nhe was married (GE 2). In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he referred to the mother of his children \nas his \u201cex-wife\u201d (GE 2). His 2008 security clearance application indicates he was never married (GE 1). \nApplicant was in a long-term relationship with the mother of his children that terminated when he was \ninvolved with another woman (hereinafter \u201cP\u201d). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \njanitorial-type duties that did not require a security clearance (Tr. 92). He does not \ncurrently hold a security clearance (Tr. 6).    \n \nMarijuana-related criminal conduct \n \nIn August 1989, the police searched Applicant\u2019s car and found drug \nparaphernalia and part of a marijuana cigarette in his ashtray (Tr. 51-53; GE 2). The \npolice arrested Applicant and he was charged with marijuana possession and \npossession of paraphernalia for using a controlled, dangerous substance (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nHe pleaded guilty and the court fined him about $150 (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. 55; GE 2). \n \nIn July 1994, Applicant and a relative were in Applicant\u2019s company\u2019s van (Tr. 55-\n58, 62, 64). Applicant\u2019s relative had rolling papers for marijuana (Tr. 56). Applicant and \nhis relative intended to smoke marijuana later that day (Tr. 64). His relative was either \non parole or probation, and so Applicant accepted responsibility for the rolling papers to \nkeep his relative out of trouble (Tr. 56-57). Applicant was charged with possession of \nparaphernalia for using a controlled, dangerous substance (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 55-56). He \npleaded guilty and the court fined him approximately $100 (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Tr. 55-59, 65; \nGE 3). \n \nOn May 30, 2008, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he stopped using \nmarijuana in 1992 (GE 2). On December 8, 2008, Applicant affirmed his OPM interview \nwas accurate (Tr. 61; GE 2). In his opening statement at this hearing (which is not \nevidence), he reiterated that he stopped using marijuana in 1992 (Tr. 46). During his \nstatement on the merits, he admitted using marijuana around the time of his July 1994 \narrest (Tr. 59). Then he again averred he stopped using marijuana in 1992 (Tr. 59). \nAfter Department Counsel suggested he contradicted himself, he said he was a regular \nmarijuana smoker from 1989 through 1994 (Tr. 59). Later, he corrected his statement to \nindicate he stopped using marijuana around January 1997, during the post-trial \nrehabilitation process after the assault discussed in the next paragraph (Tr. 59-60). In \nthe last six months of 1997, he received urinalysis tests while in a halfway house, which \nestablished that he no longer used marijuana (Tr. 59-60).   \n \nAssault-related criminal conduct \n \nApplicant and his female friend (P) have known each other since 1989 (Tr. 34). In \nJanuary 1997, he had been living with P for three months (Tr. 34). They argued about a \ntelevision program (Tr. 32). The argument escalated to physical violence (Tr. 33). P \ngrabbed a baseball bat; however, Applicant took it away from her and threw P on her \nbed (Tr. 33). He pinned P to the bed and yelled at her (Tr. 33). Applicant was so angry \nhe bit P\u2019s nose and broke a nasal bone (Tr. 35). Her nose and left eye swelled up \nimmediately (Tr. 35). Applicant realized when he heard a snap sound what he had done \nand calmed down (Tr. 35). He thought the swelling of her eye might be caused by saliva \nand infection (Tr. 76). He denied that he punched P\u2019s face or eye (Tr. 76-77). Applicant \ndecided to leave P\u2019s residence and to take his property with him (Tr. 36).  While he was \ntaking his property, mostly boxes of documents and records, P threw scalding hot \ngrease in Applicant\u2019s face (Tr. 36-37). His face was blistered and some skin pealed off \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nof his face (Tr. 37). Applicant said he was on his way to telephone the police, when the \npolice arrested him (GE 2). \n \nIn January 1997, Applicant was charged with second degree assault and first \ndegree assault based on the injuries he caused to P (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In February 1997, \nApplicant was charged with second degree assault and first degree assault (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). In March 1997, Applicant was charged with battery and second degree assault \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). The charges from January to March 1997 were nolle prosequi (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). Applicant said all of the charges alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e related to the \nJanuary 1997 altercation discussed in the previous paragraph (Tr. 37-39, 45, 65-73).   \n \nIn May 1997, Applicant was charged with three counts of second degree assault \nand one count of battery (SOR \u00b6 1.f).3 He pleaded guilty to one count of second degree \nassault, and the court sentenced him to three years of incarceration, restitution of \n$1,500, and a $150 fine (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Tr. 74).4 He said the restitution included the \ndamage P caused to her own furniture the night of the altercation (Tr. 74). The court \nsuspended all incarceration except for 179 days (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant actually served a \nmonth in confinement and six months in a pre-release center (Tr. 43). While he was in \npre-release status, he and P began corresponding with each other (Tr. 43). As part of \nthe rehabilitation process, he completed anger management and other classes, \nincluding drug abuse counseling (Tr. 90). \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant was delivering a package at a restricted-access \nfederal building (Tr. 48).5 An occupant of the building (O) refused to give Applicant entry \ninto the building even though he had seen Applicant delivering packages inside the \nbuilding on multiple occasions over the last several years (Tr. 48). Someone else let \nApplicant into the building. Applicant went to O\u2019s office and confronted O about not \nletting Applicant into the building. O put his finger in the vicinity of Applicant\u2019s face, and \nApplicant pushed O\u2019s hand to the side (Tr. 48-50). Applicant asked O not to put his \nhand in Applicant\u2019s face (Tr. 48-49). Applicant was charged with simple assault6 and \n \n3In January 2007, P was charged with second degree assault (GE 5; Tr. 68). The disposition of \nP\u2019s charge was nolle prosequi in February 2007 (GE 5). P\u2019s height is listed as 62 inches and her weight \nas 127 pounds (GE 5). Applicant\u2019s height is listed as 74 inches and his weight as 155 pounds (GE 6). \n \n4 Applicant did not list this 1997 offense on his security clearance application even though Section \n23a asks whether he was ever charged with or convicted of any felony offense (GE 1). Applicant told an \nOPM Investigator that he did not disclose this offense because he thought he was not required to list \noffenses occurring more than seven years ago (GE 2). The SOR did not allege falsification of his security \nclearance application as a security concern. I decline to hold this possible falsification against Applicant in \nthis decision because of this lack of notice.  \n \n5 Unless stated otherwise, the source for the information in this paragraph is the summary of an \nOPM interview on May 30, 2008 (GE 2). \n \n6 Applicant did not list this offense on his security clearance application even though Section 23f \nasks whether he was ever charged with or convicted of any misdemeanor offense (GE 1). Applicant told \nan OPM Investigator that he did not disclose this offense because it was thrown out in court (GE 2). The \nSOR did not allege falsification of his security clearance application as a security concern. I decline to \nhold this possible falsification against Applicant in this decision because of this lack of notice. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \nspeeding (SOR \u00b6 1.g). The court dismissed the simple assault charge because O did \nnot appear in court (GE 2). Applicant was found guilty of speeding (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Tr. 50). \nThe court fined him approximately $150 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). His employer suspended him for \nthree months without pay as a result of the incident (Tr. 49). \n  \nIn November 2005, Applicant voluntarily completed a three-day workshop \ninvolving alternatives to violence (AE A at 2-4). He learned and assisted others in the \ndevelopment of conflict management skills, which help with avoiding violence in \nstressful situations (AE A at 2-4). \n \nIn March 2006, Applicant and P were arguing in a public parking lot (Tr. 40, 77-\n82). Applicant grabbed P\u2019s shirt collar or coat collar and told her that he was tired of the \nway she was talking to him and \u201cdegrading him\u201d (Tr. 81-82; GE 2 at 4). Applicant got out \nof the car and started walking home (GE 2 at 5). P drove to an adjoining parking lot and \nwas crying in her car (Tr. 40). A woman came out of a nearby flower shop, and P told \nthe woman what occurred (GE 2 at 5). Applicant believed woman from the flower shop \nreported the alleged offense to the police (Tr. 41). Applicant denied that he committed \nany offense (Tr. 40-41). Applicant was charged with second degree assault (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h). Applicant\u2019s attorney suggested that Applicant volunteer for anger management \nclasses, and the prosecutor recommended dismissal of the charge (Tr. 41). P did not \nshow up in court (GE 2). The charge was nolle prosequi (SOR \u00b6 1.h; Tr. 96-97). \nApplicant believed if he completed the anger management class and provided a \ncertification, the record of this assault would be expunged (Tr. 96-97, 105). Applicant \ncompleted nine of ten sessions of the class; however, he did not go to his last class or \nreceive his certificate of completion (Tr. 42, 84-85).7  \n \nApplicant denied that he ever had any anger management issues (Tr. 87). He \ndenied that he was an angry or argumentative person (Tr. 88). However, he hates for \nanyone to be disrespectful to him (Tr. 89). He hates verbal abuse or being talked down \nto (Tr. 89, 94). He recognizes that his anger can build up and then \u201cboil over\u201d (Tr. 89). \nHe learned that he should walk away from emotional situations where anger might \nresult in violence (Tr. 87). He learned to avoid topics with P that might degenerate into \narguments (Tr. 88). He recognized the importance of maintaining control of his emotions \nand responses (Tr. 89).  \n \nApplicant and P are currently good friends and often do things together (Tr. 34, \n75, 82). He described her as intelligent, dignified, and beautiful (Tr. 43). P has two \nmaster\u2019s degrees and is working on her dissertation for her PhD (Tr. 75). She is also \ncontrolling and possessive (Tr. 80). He had a dysfunctional relationship with P (Tr. 43). \nIf P does something for him, she tends to use it against him later in arguments (Tr. 79-\n80). She refused to make a statement at his hearing (Tr. 46, 75). She did not want to \nmake a statement because it might adversely affect her reputation (Tr. 76). He \nmaintained that they were still friends; however, they are not intimate friends now (Tr. \n82). \n \n7Applicant disclosed this offense on his security clearance application and said he \u201cappeared in \ncourt and charges were dropped because of my innocence\u201d (GE 1).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nFrom 2004 to 2009, Applicant has provided valuable volunteer support for an \nimportant event designed to generate funds for the treatment of cancer (AE A). He also \nvolunteered and assisted with the inauguration of President Barack Obama (AE A at 5). \nHe actively supported state-level legislation to obtain and protect cemeteries at the sites \nof state hospitals (AE B). He volunteered at a variety of food kitchens for the indigent \nover the last four years (AE C). During elections, he volunteered at polling places, \nensuring compliance with election laws (AE D). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline J (criminal conduct) with respect to the allegations set forth \nin the SOR. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d The allegations of criminal conduct listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.f, 1.g, and 1.h are all established. He admitted all the drug offenses (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b), as well as the 1997 assault offense (1.f). He admitted he touched the victims in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h in an offensive manner, the victims called the police, and he was \ncharged with assault. I conclude Applicant committed assaults in 1997, 2003, and 2006. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply to his marijuana-related offenses listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b. There are some positive signs of rehabilitation. He admitted his drug-\nrelated misconduct. He was more truthful at his hearing than he was to the OPM \ninvestigator, and in his response to DOHA interrogatories. He admitted to continuing to \nuse marijuana until he was incarcerated in 1997, as opposed to his claim to the OPM \ninvestigator that he ended his marijuana consumption in 1992. Because he ended his \nmarijuana consumption 11 years ago (in 1997), new marijuana-related offenses are \nunlikely. He has articulated remorse and received drug abuse counseling. There is no \nadverse information about his current employment, and he volunteers in his community. \nThere is a sufficient evidentiary record in this case of his rehabilitation to mitigate his \nmarijuana-related offenses.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to the allegations of charged assaults in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and \n1.e. Applicant committed one assault in January 1997, and this assault resulted in four \nsets of assault charges. The alleged assaults in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e are merged \ninto the charged assault in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply to all of the offenses listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. Applicant committed three assaults, and the most recent assault \noccurred in March 2006. I am not convinced that he was completely truthful about the \nsurrounding facts involving the three assaults. He did not complete his anger \nmanagement counseling. Although he admitted offensively touching the victims in the \nthree assaults, and that his conduct was wrong, improper, and showed poor judgment, \nhe also tended to blame the victims, asserting that he was responding to their \ndisrespectful or improper treatment of him.       \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is considerable evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in 1997, and has been rehabilitated from his many \nyears of marijuana abuse. He provided more accurate information about his marijuana \nabuse at his hearing than he did to an OPM investigator and in his response to DOHA \ninterrogatories. He knows the consequences if he is caught with marijuana in the future. \nHe received drug abuse counseling as part of his 1997 rehabilitation. Applicant is a \nvalued employee, who contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. \nThere is no evidence at his current employment of any disciplinary problems. There is \nno evidence of disloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His \ncharacter and good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to \nretain his employment after his security clearance was called into question. From 2004 \nto 2009, Applicant provided volunteer support for the treatment of cancer, the \ninauguration of President Barack Obama, state-level legislation to obtain and protect \ncemeteries at the sites of state hospitals, food kitchens for the indigent, and  at polling \nplaces, ensuring compliance with election laws. \nI am satisfied that if he continues to abstain from drug abuse, and avoids future \noffenses he will have future potential for access to classified information.  \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a substantial problem with marijuana as shown by two marijuana-related \nconvictions and his admissions that he frequently abused marijuana for many years. \nHowever, he stopped using marijuana in 1997, and his drug abuse is no longer a \nsecurity concern because it is not recent. His problem with assaultive behavior is still a \nsecurity concern and cannot be mitigated at this time. The 1997 assault was sufficiently \nviolent to result in medical treatment for the victim, who had a broken nasal bone, and \nfor Applicant, who had second degree burns on his face. His decisions to offensively \ntouch others in 1997, 2003, and 2006 were knowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. \nHe continues to have a relationship with the person he assaulted in 1997 and 2006. He \ndid not complete the anger management course as agreed. He was sufficiently mature \nto be fully responsible for his conduct. Assaultive behavior shows a lack of judgment \nand/or impulse control. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all \nthe facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not \nfully mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct.    \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d8 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked for the same defense contractor since 1998, and currently holds the position of Electro- Mechanical Tech II. He is married, with two children and two step-children. In 2007, when Applicant committed the cited offenseS, his children ranged in age from three to eleven years old. Applicant applied for a security clearance in 2003. It is unclear from the record whether or not this clearance was granted, and whether or not it was in effect in 2007. The SOR does not allege that the offense occurred while Applicant held a security clearance (Items 5, 8). Between May 1 and May 3, 2007, Applicant drove to retail coffee shops on four occasions. On each occasion, he lowered his pants to below his knees, drove to the drive-through window, paid for coffee, and left.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guidelines for sexual \nbehavior and personal conduct. His request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), signed on September 30, 2005, to request a security clearance required as part of \nhis employment with a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn June 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n(Item 1) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nOctober 21, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDirective under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and E (Personal Conduct) of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 8, 2009. He submitted an Answer signed and \nnotarized on July 24, 2009, which included one attached document. He requested a \ndecision without a hearing. In his Answer, Applicant denied the Guideline D Concern \nidentified in paragraph 1, but admitted to allegation 1.a. He also denied the Concern \nexpressed in paragraph 2, Guideline E. He did not respond to allegation 2.a. However, \nthis allegation repeats the allegation stated under \u00b6 1.a. As Applicant admitted to \u00b6 1.a., \nI construe allegation 2.a. to be admitted.  \n \nOn August 13, 2009, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant \nmaterials (FORM) in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision to deny \nApplicant's request to be granted a security clearance. The FORM contained ten \ndocuments, identified as Items 1 through 10. The FORM and attached Items were \nforwarded to Applicant on August 17, 2009, and he received the package on August 28, \n2009. Applicant was given 30 days from the date he received the FORM to respond. He \nprovided a timely response dated September 25, 2009. Department Counsel forwarded \nthe response without objection. The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2009, for \nan administrative decision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has worked for the \nsame defense contractor since 1998, and currently holds the position of Electro-\nMechanical Tech II. He is married, with two children and two step-children. In 2007, \nwhen Applicant committed the cited offenseS, his children ranged in age from three to \neleven years old. Applicant applied for a security clearance in 2003. It is unclear from \nthe record whether or not this clearance was granted, and whether or not it was in effect \nin 2007. The SOR does not allege that the offense occurred while Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance (Items 5, 8). \n \nBetween May 1 and May 3, 2007, Applicant drove to retail coffee shops on four \noccasions. On each occasion, he lowered his pants to below his knees, drove to the \ndrive-through window, paid for coffee, and left. The female waitresses working at the \ndrive-through reported that in each instance he wore a tee-shirt, but no slacks or \nunderwear, and his genital area was clearly visible. Applicant stated that he engaged in \nthis same behavior four times because he did not receive any reaction and he was \nseeking a reaction from the females (Items 6, 7). \n \nIn discussing the circumstances surrounding his offense, Applicant states that \n\u201cthis was by far the worst thing I have done in my life.\u201d He notes that he was \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nexperiencing a stressful time in his life: his family had moved to a new house, and he \nhad the \u201cwinter blues.\u201d Although his general practitioner prescribed medication for \ndepression and for Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Applicant stopped taking both \nmedications because of their side effects. At the time that he exposed himself, he was \nnot taking medication. (Items 7, 9; Response).  \n \nOn May 3, 2007, Applicant was arrested at his home and escorted to jail, where \nhe remained for several hours. He was charged with four counts of public indecency, a \nmisdemeanor (Item 10). In June 2007, he pled \u201cno contest\u201d to two counts, and was \nfound guilty; the remaining two counts were dismissed. Applicant was sentenced to 60 \ndays in jail (54 suspended). He paid approximately $800 in fines, and was required to \navoid the stores where he had exposed himself. He was ordered to have a mental \nhealth assessment and participate in any recommended treatment. Applicant was also \nsentenced to two years of Community Control, under which he was required to report in \nevery month. The Community Control ended in June 2009 (Items 6, 7, 10; Response). \n \nFrom May 7 to September 14, 2007, Applicant attended nine therapy sessions \nwith a clinical psychologist. He was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder and Adult \nAntisocial Behavior. The therapy focused on his strained marriage, the effects of his \nantisocial act on his marriage, and how to reduce risk for future incidents. His therapist \nnoted that Applicant completed the treatment goals, but did not provide information \nabout the causes of Applicant's behavior, the life stresses that may have been involved, \nactions to avoid recurrence, or any prognosis about the likelihood of future similar \nconduct (Items 7, 9). \n \nApplicant's arrest was publicized in a newspaper story and television reports. His \nstatements as to who is aware of his offense are somewhat contradictory. Applicant \nreported in December 2008, that his wife, parents, and in-laws know of his conviction, \nbut his children, friends, and co-workers, other than his supervisor and company \nadministrators, do not know,. However, in his Answer of July 2009, Applicant stated that \nhis children \u201cknow a little about what happened,\u201d and his manager told him that \u201csome \npeople\u201d saw the news report. However, Applicant has never been approached by a co-\nworker about the offenses (Items 6, 7; Answer and Attachment; Response). \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \n \n2 Directive. 6.3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guidelines D and E. \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest3 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.4 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect the national interests as her \nor his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under Guideline D: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n \nUnder Guideline D, the following disqualifying conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 13(a) \n(sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been \nprosecuted) and AG \u00b6 13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack \nof discretion or judgment). The evidence is insufficient to support application of AG \u00b6 \n13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress). Adult members of Applicant's family are aware of the offense, \n \n3 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n4 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n5 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nas are his supervisor and administrators. It appears that some co-workers are aware, \nand his children have limited knowledge of it. Finally, Applicant's conduct was the \nsubject of newspaper and television reports. It is unlikely that he could be coerced to \nprovide classified information based on this offense. However, Applicant did commit a \ncriminal sexual offense, and he performed it in order to provoke a reaction from female \nmembers of the public. The crime, by its nature, is a public offense. Such conduct \ndemonstrates a complete lack of discretion. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 13(a) and AG \n\u00b6 13(d) apply. \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: AG \u00b6 14(a) (the behavior occurred prior to \nor during adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar \nnature) and AG \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior occurred not when he was an immature adolescent, but when he was 30 years \nold, married, and the father of pre-adolescent children. AG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply. \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) because his conduct was \ninfrequent, and there is no evidence of similar conduct. However, he committed the \noffense approximately two-and-one-half years ago, which is not distant in time. In \naddition, Applicant's conduct appears to have been in response to stressful events in his \nlife. It is likely that such events will continue at various points in the future. It cannot be \nconfidently predicted that Applicant will not act out again, especially since his therapist \nprovided no prognosis on which to determine the likelihood of recurrence. On the whole, \nthe limited favorable mitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) is insufficient to outweigh the \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. under Guideline E cross-references the 2007 offense cited under \nGuideline D. AG 16 (c) applies (credible adverse information in several adjudicative \nissue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information). Applicant's decision \nto expose his genitals to unknown females, in an effort to \u201dget a reaction,\u201d shows \n\n \n6 \n \n \nextremely poor judgment. Applicant repeated the action four times, each time showing \nuntrustworthiness and willingness to violate the law.  \n \n \nAs to mitigation under Guideline E, AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so \nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) cannot be applied. A little more \nthan two years have passed since Applicant exposed himself which, as discussed \npreviously, is not distant in time. Moreover, although the criminal offense was a \nmisdemeanor, it cannot be taken lightly or considered minor.  \n \n \nSome mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged \nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive \nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur). \nApplicant admits that his conduct demonstrated poor judgment, and he has attended \ntherapy. However, the therapy lasted only nine sessions. As discussed under Guideline \nD, the record contains no evidence as to the stressors that caused his behavior, \nmethods to prevent it from recurring, or a prognosis as to whether it is likely to recur. \nWithout such information, mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d) is insufficient to outweigh \nApplicant's disqualifying conduct. His behavior demonstrates a willingness to place his \nmarriage and family relationships in jeopardy, and to break the law, in order to satisfy \nhis own desires. It casts doubt on his trustworthiness and judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guidelines. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant was not an adolescent, but a 30-year-old husband and father when he \ndeliberately exposed himself to female waitresses at a coffee shop. In Applicant's favor, \nhe recognizes the poor choice he made when he committed the offense, and there is no \nevidence that he engaged in such conduct since 2007. However, these facts are \ninsufficient to mitigate his conduct.  \n \nAlthough Applicant contends that he is not vulnerable to coercion because of the \npublicity about his offenses, vulnerability is not the only basis on which an Applicant's \nbehavior is judged. Judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are also key elements in \ndetermining an Applicant's suitability to hold a security clearance. Moreover, those who \nhold security clearances enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government which is \npredicated on trust. Any criminal conduct by an applicant raises serious doubts about \nhis or her trustworthiness. Here, Applicant showed a willingness to break the law, and to \nviolate the trust of his family, to satisfy his own needs. Such behavior raises questions \nas to his trustworthiness and good judgment.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts raised by criminal sexual conduct. \nSuch doubts must be resolved in favor of the government. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where she has worked for almost two years as a customer service representative. She is married to a member of the National Guard, who has been mobilized and deployed to Iraq five times since 2003. They have three children, ages 16, 14, and 11. Both she and her husband, between his mobilization periods, have endured multiple periods of unemployment over the past six years. (GE 1 at 1-5; Tr. at 28-29, 37.) In her answer, she admitted to all of the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant\u2019s 44 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR total $33,044. Most of them are for relatively minor amounts, and many are for medical services incurred during periods when her family was not covered by health insurance.

Based upon a thorough review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to ADP I/II/III sensitive\ninformation is granted. \nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office\n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant\nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD\nC3I), entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness\ndeterminations for contractor personnel employed in Sensitive Information Systems\nPositions (ADP I/II/III), as defined in Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-\nR, Personnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended (Regulation).\nJanuary 12, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P), on April 15,\n2008. On June 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); the\nRegulation (supra); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD)\nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2009.

During the hearing, Applicant displayed a full\nunderstanding of her previous financial problems, and a sincere determination to take\nadvantage of the fresh start from bankruptcy and avoid incurring delinquent debt in the\nfuture.   \n \nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . .\nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (Regulation \u00b6\nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security)\nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will\napply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of\nPersonnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the\nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access\ndetermination may be made. (Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this\norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued persuasively that the evidence raised two of\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\nand \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant admitted owing more\nthan 40 SOR-listed delinquent debts totaling almost $20,000, and cited more than\n$25,000 in debt on her bankruptcy petition. The record shows a six-year history during\nwhich Applicant was frequently unable to satisfy some of her debts. \n\n5\nDepartment Counsel also mentioned the potential applicability of AG \u00b6 19(b),\n\u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any\nevidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt.\u201d (Tr. at 18.) Having evaluated the nature, quantity, and amounts involved in\nApplicant\u2019s debts, I find no evidence of irresponsible or frivolous spending. Given her\nunemployment problems, and the expenses inherent in supporting a family with three\nteenagers, the relatively small amount of delinquent debt shows careful management of\navailable, albeit insufficient, financial resources. There was neither any allegation nor\nproof of compulsive, addictive, or problem gambling. Nor was there any evidence of\ndrug abuse, alcoholism, or deceptive financial practices. Accordingly, no other Guideline\nF disqualifying condition was established. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a\nhistory of unpaid debt. Since Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any SOR-listed\ndebt, the four potentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies arose frequently and continued until very recently.\nHowever, she has now secured steady employment, and all prior debt was discharged\nin her 2009 Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. Her current income is more than\nsufficient to cover living expenses, so recurrence of financial problems is unlikely. Her\nfinancial problems arose largely due to involuntary unemployment and her husband\u2019s\nfrequent mobilization for overseas deployment with the National Guard. These causes\ndo not reflect poor reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment on Applicant\u2019s part.\nAccordingly, she established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI also find some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s, and her husband\u2019s,\nperiods of unemployment were involuntary and are now resolved. Many of the debts\nwere for necessary medical expenses incurred during periods when they did not have\nhealth insurance. The relatively small amount of total debt under the circumstances\n\n6\nreflects Applicant\u2019s responsible efforts to minimize expenses, and her bankruptcy filing\nis a recognized and lawful way to finally resolve outstanding indebtedness and relieve\nany ongoing pressure therefrom. \nApplicant obtained financial counseling and debtor education in connection with\nher bankruptcy filing, and the Chapter 7 discharge resolved her previously outstanding\ndebts in a good-faith manner. Her demonstrated solvency going forward, together with\nthis bankruptcy relief from prior debt, indicate that her financial situation is under control.\nRemaining security concerns are therefor mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d).  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of concern\ninvolves her delinquent debts incurred over the past six years, during periods of\ninvoluntary unemployment of herself and her husband. Considering the expenses\ninherent in supporting a family of five, including three teenagers, the total amount of this\ndebt was relatively modest, and did not reflect irresponsible spending. \nApplicant demonstrated her maturity and responsibility by acknowledging these\ndebts and taking proper legal action to resolve them through bankruptcy proceedings.\nShe now has steady employment and sufficient income to meet her living expenses\nwithout incurring further delinquencies, making continuation or recurrence of financial\nproblems unlikely. The final discharge of her former debts through bankruptcy\neliminates their potential for creating pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress that\ncould tempt Applicant to abuse her public trust position. \n\n7\nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness concerns arising from financial considerations, including her failure\nto pay some of her debts over the past six years. Overall, the record evidence leaves no\ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a public trust position.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.rr.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to ADP I/II/III sensitive information is granted.   \n  \n \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \nOn March 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline H (drug involvement). Applicant\nsubmitted an undated response to the SOR in which he admitted all SOR allegations,\nexcept the allegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.c. \nIt was unclear from Applicant\u2019s response if he was requesting a hearing or not.\nDepartment Counsel contacted Applicant, clarified that he was requesting a hearing, and\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJune 29, 2009\n\n Applicant agreed on the record to waive the 15-day notice requirement in the event he did not\n2\nactually receive the formal notice of hearing more than 15 days in advance of the hearing. (Tr. 17-18)\n2\nobtained a written note signed by Applicant verifying the request for a hearing. Applicant\u2019s\nnote was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and is included in the hearing file.\nThe case was assigned to me on April 27, 2009. A notice of hearing was issued on\nMay 5, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 21, 2009.  The hearing was conducted as\n2\nscheduled. The Government submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without objection. Applicant\ntestified and submitted one documentary exhibit that was marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\n(AE) 1 and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on May\n29, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as\na fabrication technician since February 2008. He was unemployed from September 2007\nuntil November 2007, and again from December 2007 until February 2008. The remainder\nof his reported work history consists of varying lengths of employment with a variety of\nemployers working primarily as a fabricator. He graduated from high school in January\n1981. He has attended some community college classes but he has not earned a degree\nor certificate.  \nApplicant has been married since December 1982. He does not have any children.\nApplicant began smoking marijuana when he was about 12 years old. He continued\nto smoke marijuana on a daily to weekly basis until he was in his 30s. He quit smoking\nmarijuana for about three years during the 1980s, but he then resumed using marijuana\non a regular basis. He estimates that he used marijuana a total of between 20 and 30\ntimes from 2001 until his last reported use in September 2007. He also estimates that\nsometimes months would pass without him using marijuana.\nApplicant experimented with cocaine and crack cocaine when he was in his 20s. He\nalso used mescaline for about one year while he was in his 20s. He has not used any\nillegal drug, except marijuana, since he was in his 20s. \nDuring the 1990s, Applicant would on occasion buy larger quantities of marijuana\nthan was necessary for his personal use. He would then sell a portion of what he\npurchased to reduce the overall cost of the controlled substance for himself and his\npurchasers because it was cheaper to buy it in larger quantities. Applicant asserts this was\nnot intended to earn a profit but solely to reduce his expense.       \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n4\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n6\n3\nApplicant has worked for a number of employers who had a policy against using\nillegal drugs. Despite their policies, Applicant continued to use marijuana, but never while\nworking. In either 1992 or 1993, he tested positive for marijuana in an employer mandated\nurinalysis. \nThe last time Applicant smoked marijuana was in September 2007. He smoked it\nthen with a friend who was dying from cancer. His motivation in smoking the marijuana at\nthat time was to be sociable with the friend and also because he had just recently been\nlaid-off from his job. The last time he was in the presence of anyone smoking marijuana\nwas during the summer of 2008. He was visiting with others at the same dying friend\u2019s\nresidence and a group of their mutual friends were smoking marijuana in an outbuilding at\nthe residence. Applicant left when he saw the friends were smoking marijuana. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has never used marijuana. Applicant told an investigator in August\n2008 that he could not guarantee he would not use marijuana in the future because a\nperson can never say with absolute certainty what will happen in the future. However, he\nhas no future plans to use marijuana. Applicant has never undergone drug treatment or\ncounseling. He relies upon his born-again religious beliefs and his desire to improve\nhimself as a person to keep from abusing marijuana in the future. He has possessed those\nreligious beliefs for about the past ten years.    \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Guideline H (drug involvement), with its disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n3\n4\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5\nalthough the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden\nof proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of\n6\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n Id at 531.\n11\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n12\n4\nthe evidence.\u201d  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant\n7\nto present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n8\nclearance decision.9\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n10\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n12\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\nApplicant experimented with cocaine, crack cocaine and mescaline while he was\nin his 20s. At least two decades have passed since he last used any of those drugs. Due\nto the passage of time, his abuse of those drugs in his younger years does not create an\nindependent security concern. \nHowever, Applicant illegally used marijuana on a daily to weekly basis from the time\nhe was 12 years old until sometime in his 30s. He continued to use it on a less frequent\nbasis from his 30s until his last reported use in September 2007. He purchased and sold\nthe excess quantities of marijuana he purchased during the 1990s. He tested positive for\nhaving used marijuana in a work administered urinalysis in either 1992 or 1993. \nApplicant has never undergone drug treatment or counseling. His assertion that he\nwill not use marijuana in the future is unconvincing considering: 1) his 34-year history of\nabusing marijuana; 2) he quit using marijuana for several years in the 1980s but then\nbegan to abuse the substance again; 3) his reliance on his religious beliefs did not prevent\nhim from using marijuana for many years after he came to those beliefs; 4) his regular\nviolation of his employers\u2019 policies against drug abuse even after he tested positive in a\n\n5\nwork administered urinalysis; and 5) he was in the presence of friends who were using\nmarijuana as recently as last year. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s long history of abusing marijuana, Guideline H disqualifying\nconditions (DC) 25(a): any drug abuse; DC 25(b): testing positive for illegal drug use; DC\n25(c): illegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale, or distribution; and DC 25(h):\n. . . failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use apply.\nIt has now been almost two years since Applicant last used marijuana. However, the\nsame factors that preclude finding Applicant has convincingly renounced the future use of\nmarijuana also preclude finding that the following mitigating conditions (MC) apply: MC\n26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and\ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence. . . . \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nI have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this\ncase, including Applicant\u2019s age, the lengthy period of time he abused marijuana, his\nrelapse in the 1980s after a few years of abstinence, his continued use of marijuana after\nhe failed a work-administered urinalysis, and the comparatively short period of time that\nhas elapsed since he last used marijuana. I have also considered the whole person\nconcept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable\ndisqualifying conditions. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his\nabuse of marijuana. He has not overcome the case against him nor satisfied his ultimate\nburden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\na security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e & f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion               \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

In the mid-2000s, Applicant\u2019s nephew (N) moved into Applicant\u2019s home. N\u2019s father was imprisoned for murdering his wife, N\u2019s mother. Applicant\u2019s wife believed that their home would be a good place for N to live. In April 2007, N, then 16 years of age, was watching a sexually explicit video in Applicant\u2019s living room. The video depicted young women. Applicant sat down beside N and asked him more than once if Applicant could sodomize or have oral sex with N. Applicant locked the doors to the home and repeated his request to sodomize N while N watched the video. N did not consent to this proposed sexual behavior. Applicant and N did not engage in sexual contact. Applicant was arrested and charged with enticing a child for indecent purposes. However, the charge was subsequently dismissed, because Applicant\u2019s conduct did not meet all the elements of the charged offense. Specifically, the law required that a child be under the age of 16, and, as stated above, N was past his 16th birthday at the time of the misconduct. Although not convicted of an offense, Applicant received individual treatment from a licensed clinical social worker from May 2007 to the following December.

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJ. Alexander Atwood, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 9, 2009, after\nthe hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process;\n\nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 4, Response to Interrogatories, dated December 3, 2008, includes a letter to DOHA\n1\nby the therapist.  This letter states, \u201c[Applicant] discontinued his participation with group therapy . . . We disagreed with\n[Applicant\u2019s] decision, as he broke the initial agreement of participating in treatment until we felt he had completed\ntreatment. [Applicant\u2019s] ability to participate in power struggles and be oppositional to authority is definitely an issue\nhe will have to work on.  We see this as a significant deficiency.  Due to [his] decision to discontinue group therapy, he\nis not considered to have successfully completed the treatment initially outlined for him through his psychosexual\nassessment and individual treatment with [therapy provider].\u201d   \nwhether the Judge erred in admitting a document describing Applicant\u2019s conduct; whether the Judge\nmis-weighed the record evidence; whether the Judge failed to consider all the record evidence; and\nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFinding no harmful error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a fleet mechanic for\na Government contractor.  He has held a security clearance since 2004.  He is married, with three\nchildren, ages 19, 15, and 13.\nIn the mid-2000s, Applicant\u2019s nephew (N) moved into Applicant\u2019s home.  N\u2019s father was\nimprisoned for murdering his wife, N\u2019s mother.  Applicant\u2019s wife believed that their home would\nbe a good place for N to live.  \nIn April 2007, N, then 16 years of age, was watching a sexually explicit video in Applicant\u2019s\nliving room.  The video depicted young women.  Applicant sat down beside N and asked him more\nthan once if Applicant could sodomize or have oral sex with N.  Applicant locked the doors to the\nhome and repeated his request to sodomize N while N watched the video.  N did not consent to this\nproposed sexual behavior.  Applicant and N did not engage in sexual contact.\nApplicant was arrested and charged with enticing a child for indecent purposes.  However,\nthe charge was subsequently dismissed, because Applicant\u2019s conduct did not meet all the elements\nof the charged offense.  Specifically, the law required that a child be under the age of 16, and, as\nstated above, N was past his 16th birthday at the time of the misconduct.  \nAlthough not convicted of an offense, Applicant received individual treatment from a\nlicensed clinical social worker from May 2007 to the following December.  He also participated in\ngroup sessions for nine months.  The therapist advised that Applicant did not successfully complete\nthe treatment due to his difficulties with authority.   Testing conducted during Applicant\u2019s treatment\n1\nindicated that he does not have a \u201cpersistent sexual attraction\u201d to children or adolescents.  Decision\nat 4.  As a child, Applicant was sexually molested by his older brother.  At age 15 one or two women\nin their thirties had sexual relations with him.  His therapist \u201cintimated that these earlier incidents\nof molestation were misinterpreted by Applicant to be conventional, sexual encounters during his\nteenage years.\u201d  Id.\nApplicant enjoys a good reputation at his place of employment for the quality of his\nworkmanship.\n\nDue Process Violation\nApplicant contends that he was denied due process.  Specifically, he argues that the Judge\nerred in taking administrative notice of a state statute other than the one with which he was charged\nand which was referenced in the SOR.  We find this argument persuasive.\nThe SOR contained one Guideline J allegation, a repeat of the first allegation under Guideline\nD.  This allegation is as follows: \u201cYou were arrested in about May 2007 in [City, State] and charged\nwith Enticing a Child for Indecent Purposes.  The charges were dropped in about December 2007.\u201d\nAs stated above, this charge was dropped because of the age of the victim.  However, the Judge took\nofficial notice of another state statute which, he concluded, could have been charged and which\njustified an adverse finding under Guideline J.  He stated, \u201cI have taken administrative notice of the\nexistence of another state statute that applies to victims under the age of 18.  This statute, which was\nenacted in 1992, was in effect in April 2007, when Applicant enticed his nephew for indecent\npurposes.  For unknown reasons, the state did not indict Applicant under the correct statute.\u201d  Id. at\n2.   The Judge relied upon this statute in concluding that Applicant\u2019s conduct with N constituted a\nGuideline J security concern.  \nThe Judge\u2019s treatment of this statute does not quote it verbatim or otherwise identify it with\nsufficient specificity that we can determine its content.  It is well settled that a DOHA Judge may\ntake official notice of facts pertinent to a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-06478 at 3-5 (App. Bd.\nDec. 15, 2003); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007).  See also Federal Rule of\nEvidence 201 and Directive \u00b6 E3.1.19 (\u201cThe Federal Rules of Evidence . . . shall serve as a guide\u201d\nin DOHA proceedings).  This includes any pertinent provision of state law.  ISCR Case No. 01-\n08565 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2003).  However, the Board must be able to examine such provisions\nin order to determine their relevance.  Id. at n. 2.  In the case under consideration here, we are unable\nto verify the Judge\u2019s statement that there is an alternative provision of state law that would have\napplied to Applicant and that would support a conclusion that his case set forth a Guideline J security\nconcern.  Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s lack of specificity is an error.\nRemaining Errors \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in admitting an affidavit by an official of the local\nSheriff\u2019s Department.  This affidavit summarizes an interview with N, in which N describes the\nevents which led to Applicant\u2019s arrest.  Applicant contends that this document constitutes\ninadmissible hearsay.  However, we have examined this document, which is part of a Booking\nReport prepared by the Sheriff\u2019s Department.  It is an official record compiled or created in the\nregular course of business and otherwise complies with the requirements of Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s ruling was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-08813 at 5 (App. Bd. Nov. 15, 2005) (The Board will examine a Judge\u2019s\nevidentiary rulings to determine if they are consistent with Executive Order 10865 and with the\nDirective and to determine if they are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law).  \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23,\n\n2008).  Applicant\u2019s presentation on appeal is not sufficient to rebut that presumption.  Furthermore,\nthe record provides no basis to conclude that Applicant has weighed the evidence in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug.\n13, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nAlthough we have found error in the Judge\u2019s analysis of the Guideline J security concern, we\nconclude that his decision is sustainable under the remaining two guidelines.  Therefore, the error\ndescribed above is harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009); ISCR\nCase No. 01-23362 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09915 (App. Bd. Dec. 16, 2004);\nISCR Case No. 01-11192 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2002).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that, other than the error described above, the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Alexander Atwood, Esq.\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nOn February 8, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance questionnaire\n(SCA). On April 15, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the Office\nof Personnel Management (OPM). On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security\nconcerns under sexual behavior (Guideline D), personal conduct (Guideline E), and\ncriminal conduct (Guideline H). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nNovember 9, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on April 23, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non June 3, 2009, and the hearing was held on June 23, 2009. At the hearing, four\ngovernment exhibits (GE 1 through GE 4) were admitted in evidence. Applicant\nobjected to a portion of GE 2 (the investigating officer\u2019s affidavit) as hearsay (Tr. 13-15).\nThat objection was overruled. While the affidavit in GE 2 contains hearsay, it is admitted\nin evidence as a business record generated by a police officer in the normal course of\nhis job duties and sworn to under oath before a state magistrate. It is well settled that\nrelevant hearsay may be admitted in DOHA administrative proceedings because the\nFederal Rules of Evidence (FRE) serve as a guide. I find the affidavit contains relevant\nhearsay evidence of the surrounding circumstances of the criminal offense on April 28,\n2007, and, along with the remainder of GE 2, is admitted in evidence. \nApplicant and two witnesses testified. Two exhibits (AE A, AE B) were admitted\nin evidence without objection to support Applicant\u2019s case. DOHA received a copy of the\nhearing transcript on July 7, 2009. \nAdministrative Notice\nApplicant was prosecuted under a state statute defining the victim as \u201cany child\nunder the age of 16 years.\u201d The criminal prosecution was dismissed because the victim\nwas 16 years old when the enticement occurred. I have taken administrative notice of\nthe existence of another state statute that applies to victims under the age of 18. This\nstatute, which was enacted in 1992, was in effect in April 2007, when Applicant enticed\nhis nephew for indecent purposes. For unknown reasons, the state did not indict\nApplicant under the correct sexual offense statute.  \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains three allegations under the sexual behavior guideline, one\nallegation under the personal conduct guideline, and one allegation under the criminal\nconduct guideline. Applicant admitted the factual allegations of SOR \u00b6 1, but denied his\nconduct constituted sexual behavior as set forth in the guideline. He noted the charge\nwas dismissed and he was not given a hearing (answer to SOR). He admitted the\nfactual allegations of paragraph 2 and 3. Applicant\u2019s admissions will be incorporated in\nthe following factual findings. \nApplicant, 45 years old, has been married to his wife for 14 years. He has three\nchildren, ages 19, 15, and 13. He has been employed as a fleet mechanic by a defense\ncontractor since October 1988. He has held a security clearance since March 2004. He\nseeks reinstatement of his security clearance. \nSexual Behavior\nApplicant\u2019s 16-year-old nephew moved into Applicant\u2019s home in November 2005\nafter the nephew\u2019s father was incarcerated for murdering the nephew\u2019s mother (Tr. 36).\nApplicant\u2019s wife thought their home would be a good location for the nephew (Tr. 38). \n\n The State code provides \u201da person commits the offense of enticing a child for indecent purposes when he\n1\nsolicits, entices, or takes any child under the age of 16 years to any place whatsoever for the purpose of child\nmolestation or indecent acts.\u201d \n3\nOn May 10, 2007, an investigator from the county sheriff\u2019s department\ninterviewed Applicant\u2019s 16-year-old nephew (victim). That interview is contained in an\naffidavit attached to the booking report (GE 2). The victim stated that on April 28, 2007,\nhe was sitting in the living room watching a sexually explicit video involving young\nwomen. Applicant sat down beside the victim and asked about four times if he could\nsodomize or have oral sex with the victim (Id.). During the time Applicant was making\nthese requests (he made two requests while on his knees), he explained to the victim\nthat males sodomize better on other males than females do on males because males\nare more aware of the feeling. The victim became sexually aroused by Applicant\u2019s\nstories and displayed his penis, but was concerned about the activity being detected.\nApplicant locked all the doors to the home, and repeated his request to sodomize the\nvictim while he watched the video. The victim did not permit Applicant to sodomize him\n(Id.). \nIn his interview with the OPM investigator in April 2008, Applicant claimed that he\nnever solicited the victim for indecent purposes (GE 3, April 15, 2008 interview of\nApplicant, at 4). Throughout the interview, Applicant essentially claimed that the criminal\ncharge resulted from a conversation he had with his nephew where he attempted to\naddress each sexual issue in a direct manner (Id. at 4-5). \nThere is no admission in his April 2008 interview that Applicant admitted he tried\nto give oral sex to his nephew. Rather, he stated that he learned through treatment that\nbecause of his own childhood sexual experiences, he had been too direct in discussing\nsexual issues with his nephew (GE 3, April 15, 2008, at 4-5), and he found more\nappropriate ways of talking about sexual issues (Id.). \nApplicant explained at the hearing that the enticement for oral sex (though he did\nnot use the words identifying the criminal offense) occurred in an attempt to be as direct\nas he could in explaining sexual issues to the victim, including what a \u2018blow job\u2019 was (Tr.\n42). In addition, Applicant caught the victim masturbating earlier that day (Tr. 43). Until\nhis therapy (May 2007 to September 2008), Applicant testified he did not believe an\nadult\u2019s sexual relationship with a child was wrong because it was an event in life that felt\ngood (Tr. 44). Applicant never engaged in this kind of behavior with his children (Tr. 44-\n45). Applicant appeared to change his position about the enticement for indecent\npurposes by testifying that he knew at the time he attempted to engage in the conduct\nwith the victim in April 2007 that it was wrong (Tr. 48). \nOn May 10, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), Applicant was arrested and charged with enticing\na child for indecent purposes. The charge was dismissed on November 21, 2007\nbecause (1) the state declined to prosecute, and (2) the elements of the offense were\nnot met (AE A).  At the time of the sexual behavior, the victim was 16 years old, over\n1\n\n4\nthe age set forth in the statute. Following the second reason for the state\u2019s decision not\nto prosecute is the sentence, \u201cDefendant is in treatment\u201d (Id.).\nUnder SOR \u00b6 1.b., Applicant attended individual treatment once a week from\nMay 2007 to December 2007 (AE 3; Tr. 21). The licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)\nadvised that group therapy would also benefit Applicant therapeutically. Applicant\u2019s\ninsurance paid for the first 6 months of treatment, but he used his own funds to pay the\nremaining 10 months of treatment as required by his treatment administrators (Tr. 23).\nApplicant recalled the LCSW recommended that he attend about four months of group\ntherapy, but Applicant participated in group therapy for nine months (SOR \u00b6 1.c.).\nHowever, in a letter to DOHA describing Applicant\u2019s participation in individual and group\ntherapy, the LCSW indicated that Applicant agreed to participate in treatment until the\nLCSW determined he had completed treatment (GE 4, December 15, 2008, letter from\nLSCW to DOHA). In concluding that Applicant did not successfully complete treatment,\nthe LSCW advised that Applicant\u2019s \u201cability to participate in power struggles and be\noppositional to authority is definitely an issue he will have to work on. We see this as a\nsignificant deficiency\u201d (Id.).\nOnce every week for an hour between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. in the afternoon (Tr.\n39), Applicant drove to the individual/group therapy location about 35 miles from his\nhouse and 45 miles from work (Tr. 39-40). He discontinued therapy in September 2008\nwhen his wife needed help in caring for her parents who had been injured in a terrible\ncar accident (Tr. 21, 23). \nDuring individual treatment in November 2007, Applicant took the Abel\nAssessment Test for Sexual Interest Interpretation  (Abel Sex Test, GE 4; Tr. 26).\nThe test is designed to assess the sexual interest of the testee based on reaction times\nafter viewing and rating slides of adults and children in different kinds and stages of\ndress, and in different scenarios or situations. At the hearing, Applicant restated most of\nthe critical findings of the test. The most important finding of the test, as restated by\nApplicant, was that he was sexually interested in adult females only (Tr. 27; GE 4).\nThe objective interpretations of the Abel Sex Test (GE 4) showed that\nApplicant\u2019s greatest sexual interest was in adult females and \u201cdoes not appear to have a\npersistent sexual attraction to children or adolescent males/females\u201d (Id. at 4). \nApplicant believed that there were sexual incidents in his early life that led to his\nbehavior in April 2008 (Tr. 28). When he was 12 or 13 years old, his brother molested\nhim for about four months (Tr. 29). At age 15, one or two women in their 30s had sexual\nrelations with him for more than a year (Id.). His LCSW intimated that these earlier\nincidents of molestation were misinterpreted by Applicant to be conventional, sexual\nencounters during his teenage years (GE 4, Abel Sex Test at 4-5). \nWhen Applicant filled out the SCA, he answered one or two of the criminal\nconduct questions incorrectly (GE 2). The reason for the errors is because of his\nreading comprehension difficulties (Tr. 32). \n\n5\nApplicant has never had disciplinary problems at work (Tr. 25), and only one\nminor arrest in 1983 (Tr. 26). He has never been involved in this kind of sexual behavior\nin the past (Tr. 34). He has never had psychiatric or psychological counseling (Tr. 19). \nCharacter Evidence\nWitness 1 is the group lead technician with 23 years of seniority. Applicant began\nworking at their employer in 1988, and, according to Witness 1, has been a good\nemployee, although Witness 1 has only seen Applicant sparingly in the last 10 years.\n(Tr. 61) Witness 1 did not think there was much substance in the reason why Applicant\nwas put in jail in May 2007 (Tr. 59). He heard from other people the charges were\ndismissed (Tr. 60). \nWitness 2 is the operations manager who has known Applicant for about 20\nyears. He has supervised Applicant for the last six years (Tr. 65), and they alternatively\ninvite each other over for occasional cookouts (65-66). Witness 2 is aware that criminal\ncharges against Applicant were dropped (Tr. 69).\nApplicant\u2019s yearly performance evaluations from 1991 through 2008 (AE B)\nreflect favorable assessments as a self starter who exceeds requirements and learns\nquickly. He demonstrates he is well informed and produces a product that shows good\nworkmanship (Id.). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. If residual\ndoubts still remain concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation, those doubts will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nSexual Behavior\n\u00b6 12 of the AG sets forth sets forth the security concern related to sexual\nbehavior:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects a lack of judgement or discretion, or which\nmay subject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning th standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \nThe sexual behavior guideline has two disqualifying conditions that apply to this\ncase:\nAG \u00b6 13(a) (sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the\nindividual has been prosecuted); and\nAG \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress).\nApplicant\u2019s enticement of his nephew on April 28, 2007, was sexual behavior of a\ncriminal nature, even though the state charges were dismissed. Applicant could have\nbeen prosecuted under the childhood sexual abuse statute for enticing a child under\nage 18 for indecent purposes. AG \u00b6 13(a) applies. \n\n7\nBy enticing the victim for indecent purposes, Applicant violated his duty of care\nand protection for his nephew to satisfy his own sexual desires. GE 2 conclusively\ndemonstrates Applicant would have accomplished his objective had his nephew\nsuccumbed to Applicant\u2019s constant appeals for sex. Applicant\u2019s minimization of the\nseriousness of his behavior, i.e., not admitting his sexual misconduct, continues to leave\nhim vulnerable to coercion and pressure as defined by in AG \u00b6 13(c). \nThe sexual behavior guideline lists two mitigating conditions that may be\napplicable to this case:\nAG \u00b6 14 (b) (the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently,\nor under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment); and\nAG \u00b6 14(c) (the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion,\nexploitation, or duress).\nThe enticement occurred in April 2007, less than three years ago. In February\n2008, Applicant reported the charge on his SCA. In April 2008, Applicant provided an\ninterview and referred to the criminal offense as nothing more than a conversation he\nhad with his nephew where he attempted to explain sexual issues. Applicant even\ndenied he solicited his nephew. In December 2008, his LCSW wrote that Applicant did\nnot successfully complete treatment, and explained that he disagreed with Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to stop treatment as there were power and authority issues he needed to deal\nwith. \nIn his answer to the definition of sexual behavior set forth in SOR \u00b6 1, Applicant\nunambiguously stated that he did not entice his nephew for indecent purposes. His\ndenial and minimization of serious misconduct continue to cast doubt on his judgment\nand reliability. His denial that the enticement occurred continues to serve as a basis for\nexploitation and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(c) and 14(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s favorable job\nperformance since 1991 has been examined along with the positive testimony from\nWitnesses 1 and 2. Neither is sufficient to find the sexual behavior guideline in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nPersonal Conduct (PC)\n\u00b6 15 of the AG sets forth the concern of the personal conduct guideline:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n8\nThe personal conduct guideline (AG \u00b6 16) has one mitigating condition that may\napply: \nAG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct, that creates vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\nsuch as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the U.S. and may serve as the basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign country or intelligence service or\ngroup).\nApplicant\u2019s poor judgment in enticing his nephew for indecent purposes in April\n2007, and then subsequently minimizing the seriousness of the conduct, causes him to\nbe vulnerable to coercion and duress as outlined in AG 16(e). \nThe personal conduct guideline (AG \u00b6 17) lists three mitigators that may apply to\nthe circumstances of this case:\nAG \u00b6 17(a) (the offense was so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and\nAG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to\nalleviate stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to\nrecur); and \nAG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress). \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply because the sexual behavior occurred less than three\nyears ago even though the behavior occurred on only one occasion. Applicant\u2019s\nequivocal statements about enticing his nephew in April 2007 continue to cast doubt on\nhis trustworthiness and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. Though Applicant acknowledged in his April 2008\ninterview that he had a conversation about sex with his nephew, Applicant claimed he\nnever solicited his nephew, a claim he repeated in his answer to the SOR. Though he\nhas participated in 16 months of counseling between May 2007 and September 2008,\nthe documentation from the treatment organization verifies that he did not successfully\ncomplete the counseling. In addition, his LCSW believed he still had power struggles\nand authority issues that had not been reconciled when he discontinued group therapy.\nAG \u00b6 17(d) applies on a limited basis because of his treatment. \u00b6 17(e) does not apply.\n\n9\nWith Applicant\u2019s belief he did not entice his nephew, he has not shown that he has\ntaken the necessary steps to reduce his vulnerability to coercion. AG \u00b6 15 is resolved\nagainst Applicant. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\n\u00b6 30 of the AG sets forth the security concern related to criminal conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe criminal conduct guideline has two applicable disqualifying conditions:\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses); and \nAG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). \nOn April 28, 2007, Applicant engaged in criminal conduct when he tried to give\nhis nephew oral sex. While his nephew may have asked Applicant several questions\nabout sexual acts, including oral sex, Applicant exhibited extremely poor judgment in\nrepeatedly trying to show his nephew what oral sex was, even descending to a kneeling\nposition to achieve his objective. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply even though the charges\nwere dismissed. As noted in Administrative Notice, Applicant\u2019s conduct meets the\nelements of the state childhood sexual abuse statute applying to victims under the age\nof 18. \nThe criminal conduct guideline has two mitigating conditions that may apply.\nAG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has passed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment); and  \nAG \u00b6 32 (d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment\nrecord, or constructive community development). \nApplicant\u2019s enticement of his nephew occurred less than three years ago. His\ndenial of the full scope of his criminal misconduct sparks continuing concern about his\njudgment that has not been lessened by his exculpatory statements during and after his\ntreatment between May 2007 and September 2008. AG 32(a) does not apply. \n\n10\nAG \u00b6 32(d) identifies some elements of successful rehabilitation. Successful\nrehabilitation hinges on whether the individual fully realizes the consequences of his\nactions. Applicant has not demonstrated he is fully cognizant of the seriousness of his\nconduct. \nApplicant\u2019s \n16 \nmonths \nof \ntreatment helped \nhim \nunderstand \nthe\ninappropriateness of his past sexual experiences with his brother and older women,\nwhile discovering more appropriate ways of discussing sexual issues. However, the\nLCSW found that Applicant did not successfully complete treatment. Applicant\u2019s\nfavorable job performance justifies limited application of AG \u00b6 32(d), but does not\novercome the adverse evidence under AG \u00b6\u00b631(a) and 31(c).\nWhole Person Concept \n\u00b6 2(c) indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the whole person concept. Nine general policy factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) define the\nWhole Person Concept as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. The testimony of\nWitness 1 and 2 substantiate his good performance evaluations. His favorable evidence\nand lack of a criminal record show some evidence of mitigation.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s criminal, sexual misconduct was serious. His strong belief\nhe did not solicit or entice his nephew in April 2007 is contradicted by his admission at\nthe hearing that knew the conduct was wrong. The contrasting statements foster\ncontinuing concern that Applicant does not accept the gravity of his conduct. Given his\nfailure to successfully complete his treatment, Applicant has provided insufficient\nevidence for me to confidently conclude this kind of conduct will not be repeated in the\nfuture. Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation does not overcome the adverse evidence\nunder the sexual behavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct guidelines. \n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Sexual behavior, Guideline D):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline J)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline G. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 29, 2009. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 14, 2009, and DOHA received his answer on May 18, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 27, 2009. The case was \nMay 17, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \npreviously assigned to two other administrative judges before it was assigned to me. \nThe first assignment occurred on July 28, 2009, the second reassignment occurred on \nSeptember 18, 2009, and the third assignment to me occurred on September 28, 2009. \nOn October 20, 2009, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for \nNovember 17, 2009. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through X, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his behalf. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 24, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations alleged. After \na thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old parachute rigger, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since October 2000. (GE 1, Tr. 15-16.) Applicant seeks to reinstate \nhis security clearance. Maintaining a clearance is a condition of his continued \nemployment. (Tr. 16-17.)  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1980. (Tr. 23.) He served in the \nU.S. Army from October 1989 to August 1998, and was honorably discharged as a \nprivate first class (pay grade E-3). His military occupational specialty was 43E \n(parachute rigger). He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in general science and \nbusiness in June 2007. (GE 1, Tr. 17-18, 24.)  \n \nApplicant married in April 1993. He has two adult daughters from a previous \nrelationship as well as an adult stepdaughter. Applicant and his wife have a 13-year-old \ndaughter. (Tr. 18-23, 25.) \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nApplicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse, marked by an extensive history \nof six alcohol-related arrests spanning a 16-year period from March 1989 to August \n2005. This hearing was Applicant\u2019s second DOHA hearing in which alcohol formed the \nbasis of security concerns.  \n \nHis previous hearing was held on July 21, 2004, and five alcohol-related \nconcerns were substantiated. They are: (1) he was arrested in March 1989 for driving \nunder the influence. He was convicted and fined; (2) he was charged in September \n1993 with driving while impaired, with a blood alcohol level of .07%. He was in the Army \nserving overseas at the time. His commander issued him a letter of reprimand; (3) he \nwas apprehended in December 1996 for driving under the influence. He was serving in \nthe Army stateside at the time. His commander awarded him 45 days extra duty at \nnonjudicial punishment; (4) he was apprehended in May 1998 for driving under the \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninfluence. He was serving in the Army stateside at the time. His commander awarded \nhim a reduction in grade at nonjudicial punishment. This reduction in grade was a \ncareer-ending event for him; and (5) he was arrested in January 2000 for driving while \nintoxicated. He was convicted and his driver\u2019s license was suspended. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b.i. \u2013 \nv.) (GE 1 \u2013 10, Tr. 25-41.) \n \nHe stated at his July 2004 hearing that he had quit drinking since January 2004, \nand that he intended to abstain from alcohol. (GE 5, pgs. 35-36.) The following colloquy \noccurred between Applicant and his counsel at his July 2004 DOHA hearing: \n \nQ. And do you understand how controlling your alcohol \nconsumption, and controlling the impulses that make you want to \nconsume alcohol, is important for you to be eligible to maintain, or receive \na security clearance? \n \nA. Most definitely. Like, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to have a major \nproblem controlling, because I\u2019ve stopped for six months. And I have \nstopped before, for four, and I don\u2019t have a problem stopping. But I always \ngo back. \n \nWell this time, I\u2019m thinking, me and my wife have talked. And I think \nwhat\u2019s going to help me the most is, I\u2019m seeking God in my life right now. \nI\u2019m going to church every Sunday. And I\u2019m just trying to learn more about \nthe Bible, to turn my life over to Him. \n \nAnd I think the only reason I haven\u2019t right now is I don\u2019t know as \nmuch about religion. And that I know I\u2019m going to have to give up drinking. \nSo when I\u2019m ready to do that, I want to be sure that I know exactly what \nI\u2019m doing. And I don\u2019t feel like it will be a problem. \n \nQ. And you\u2019re ready to give up drinking, correct? \n \nA. Yes, sir. (GE 5, pgs. 47-48.) \n \nFollowing his hearing, the Administrative Judge granted Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant testified at his second hearing, \u201cI believe after we had the hearing, \nme and my wife, we flew back home and probably that weekend I had a beer or two, not \ngetting drunk but a beer. And then over time, I was drinking two and three beers again.\u201d \n(Tr. 41.) \n \nSince Applicant\u2019s previous 2004 DOHA hearing, he was arrested again for \ndriving under the influence in August 2005. He was convicted and sentenced to jail, \nfined, and referred for alcohol screening and counseling. Applicant testified that he \u201cwas \nheld overnight and saw the judge the next morning. He (the judge) released me on my \nown and I went back to court and the jail sentence was suspended. I had to pay I think \n$1,100 in fines and I went through a[n] alcohol program.\u201d (Tr. 42.)(SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe evidence also established that Applicant consumed alcohol from 1984 to \n2009, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication. He admitted to experiencing \nblackouts from drinking. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) (Response to SOR, GE 1-10, Tr. 48-49, 59.) \n \nApplicant testified that he presently consumes alcohol and that the last time he \nconsumed alcohol was the weekend before his second DOHA hearing. He admitted \nbeing intoxicated that weekend. He later clarified his answer stating that he was not \n\u201cintoxicated,\u201d but \u201cbuzzed.\u201d (Tr. 45-48.) When asked by Department Counsel if he \nintended to continue drinking alcohol in the future, he responded, \u201cIf \u2013 I need to stop, I \nwould. If it was appointed by this proceeding or if I had to, yes, ma\u2019am. I would stop. But \nhad I thought about stopping? Yes. On my own, but I don\u2019t think unless I\u2019m told to by \nthis proceeding that I would stop.\u201d (Tr. 46.) \n \nDepartment Counsel and Applicant engaged in the following colloquy: \n \nQ. How are you going to avoid getting a DUI in the future? \n \nA. By not getting in the wheel (sic) when I have been drinking. \n \nQ. Now, didn\u2019t you essentially give that same answer in 2004? \n \nA. Yes, and I believed \u2013 on myself, I believed I had control of that in \n2004. But the way I was thinking about it is when I go somewhere, my wife \nis driving. Well, I can\u2019t depend on her. I have to depend on myself. And \nthat\u2019s why I say if I\u2019m anywhere and I\u2019ve been drinking, I\u2019m not driving. I\u2019ve \npicked up golf now. I don\u2019t drink when I\u2019m playing golf. Other guys do. I \ntake them home and pick them up when they call me and ask. That\u2019s how \nI\u2019m changing. (Tr. 52.) \n \nWhen I queried Applicant about how he viewed alcohol today, he responded, \u201cI \nthink I\u2019ve made bad decisions with drinking. I don\u2019t think I drink too much or I\u2019m an \nalcoholic. I think I\u2019ve made very poor decisions by drinking and driving.\u201d (Tr. 58.) \nApplicant is not in a treatment program adding that he thought about going to Alcoholic \nAnonymous meetings, stating \u201c[b]ut I fight with myself on that because I don\u2019t believe I \nhave a problem.\u201d (Tr. 59-60.) \n \nApplicant submitted ten work-related reference letters. All of the authors of the \nreference letters were positive in their assessment of Applicant and view him as \ntrustworthy and reliable. AE B \u2013 J. He also submitted 14 work-related certificates \nreflecting his contributions as a defense contractor employee. AE K \u2013 X.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern concerning alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \n \nTwo alcohol consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case. Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) provide: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent. \n \nApplicant\u2019s six alcohol-related arrests from 1989 to 2005, admitted periodic \nexcessive drinking from 1984 to 2009, and admitted blackouts warrant application of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). The Government produced substantial evidence supporting these \ntwo disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nand prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never \nshifts to the Government.1 \n \n \nTwo alcohol consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not define the sufficiency of the passage of time, and there is no \n\u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. Based on my evaluation of \n \n1See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nthe record evidence as a whole2 and Applicant\u2019s having been granted a clearance \nfollowing a DOHA hearing in July 2004 and his return to drinking despite assurances he \nwould not do so, I am unable to apply AG \u00b6 20(a).  \n \nApplicant appeared to have acknowledged his drinking problem at his July 2004 \nhearing and stated that he had quit drinking in January 2004. He returned to drinking \nthe first weekend after his July 2004 and continues to drink to the present. AG \u00b6 20(b) \ndoes not apply. Applicant\u2019s return to drinking lead to his August 2005 arrest for driving \nunder the influence 13 months after his July 2004 DOHA hearing. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence suggesting he has \novercome his problem. His assurances that he does not have a drinking problems ring \nhollow given his record of six alcohol-related arrests with the most recent arrest \noccurring after his last DOHA hearing. I am left with doubts regarding his continuing to \ndrink and whether his alcohol consumption problems are \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nApplicant was honorably discharged from the Army after serving over eight \nyears. He has been a valued employee for the past ten years working for a defense \ncontractor. Other than his past alcohol-related arrests, he is a law abiding citizen. He \nsubmitted statements of positive work-related references. \n \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of alcohol abuse and the related problems \nthat alcohol consumption has caused him and others leaves me with doubt regarding \n \n2See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). \n   \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nhis eligibility to hold a security clearance. Particularly troubling is his prior history of \nhaving gone through this hearing process in 2004 and his return to drinking which \nresulted in a subsequent alcohol-related arrest. Given his history, more is required than \nhis assurances that he does not have a drinking problem.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption. The evidence leaves me with \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.   \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant has not met his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the \nlaw, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole-person factors\u201d3 and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not \neligible for access to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. to c.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Her eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on February 5, 2008. On June 30, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, and Guideline B, \nForeign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nDecember 15, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn August 4, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested that \nher case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided the FORM to Applicant on September 9, \n2009. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 7. In addition, the \nGovernment compiled facts about Israel from ten official U.S. government publications \nand requested that I take administrative notice of those facts. By letter dated September \n9, 2009, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM, the factual summary containing \ninformation about Israel, and the source documents from which those facts were \nderived to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or \nobjections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the file on September 15, 2009. \nHer response was due on October 15, 2009. She did not submit any information or raise \nany objections within the required time period. On December 7, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations that raise security concerns under Guideline \nC, Foreign Preference (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.) and five allegations that raise security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.e.). In her \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all Guideline C and Guideline B allegations. Her \nadmissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 37 years old, married, and the mother of a minor child. Since 2005, \nshe has been employed as an assistant professor at a university in the United States. In \nNovember 2007, she also accepted a position as a consultant to a defense contractor. \nShe seeks a security clearance for the first time. (Item 5 at 12-14, 19-20, 23.)  \n \n \nApplicant was born in the Soviet Union in 1972. In 1990, as a young adult, she \nwas granted an emigration visa by the Soviet government, which permitted her to \nimmigrate to Israel. Upon entry to Israel, she was eligible to receive Israeli citizenship \nunder the Law of Return. She acquired an Israeli passport in 1994, which she used to \ntravel to the United States in 1995. From 1996 to 2002, Applicant pursued graduate \nstudies in the United States, and she was awarded a Ph.D. from a U.S. university in \n2002. Between 2002 and 2005, she was a post-doctoral fellow in computer science and \nmathematics at higher education institutions in the United States. (Item 5 at 13-18; Item \n6 at 3, 6.)   \n \n \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in May 2002, and she acquired a U.S. passport \nin December 2003. She claims dual citizenship with Israel. In 2004, she renewed her \nIsraeli passport, which is valid until May 2014. While possessing a valid U.S. passport, \nApplicant used her Israeli passport to travel to Israel in 2004 and 2007. She also used \nher Israeli passport to travel to Brazil in 2006. By using her Israeli passport in lieu of her \nU.S. passport on these occasions, Applicant exercised her Israeli citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in May 2002.  (Item 5 at 8, 27, 29; Item 6 at 2, 6; Item 7 at 3, 7.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn an interview with an authorized investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in April 2008, Applicant expressed a willingness to renounce her   \nIsraeli citizenship if required to do so as a condition for access to classified information. \nHowever, in January 2009, in response to DOHA interrogatories, she answered \u201cYes\u201d \nwhen asked if she intended to renew her Israeli passport, and she explained that she \nwanted to use her Israeli passport to travel to Israel to visit her family there.  (Item 6 at \n3; Item 7 at 3.)     \n \n \nApplicant and her husband were married in Israel in 1992. Applicant\u2019s husband \nwas born in the United States and is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel. \nApplicant\u2019s eight-year-old daughter was born in the United States and is a dual citizen of \nthe United States and Israel. Applicant\u2019s husband and daughter reside with her in the \nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, \nand he resides in the United States. (Item 5 at 20, 23, 24.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father, mother, and sister are citizens and residents of Israel. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a retired eldercare worker; her father is a retired bookbinder; and \nher sister is a nurse. Applicant\u2019s parents and sister are not affiliated with the Israeli \ngovernment. Her relatives are aware of her position and have not requested that she \nreveal classified information to them. (Item 5 at 21-26; Item 6 at 3-4.) \n \n \nApplicant communicates frequently with her parents and her sister. She talks with \nthem on the telephone two or three times a month. (Item 6 at 3, 6.)  \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Israel, as contained in \nofficial U.S. government documents provided by Department Counsel to Applicant in the \nFORM: \n \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy of about 6.4 million people. Israel generally \nrespects the human rights of its citizens, although there have been some allegations of \nmistreatment of Palestinian detainees and discrimination against Israel\u2019s Arab citizens. \nDespite the instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel's relations within the \nregion since it came into existence, Israel has developed a diversified, technologically \nadvanced market economy focused on high-technology electronic and biomedical \nequipment, chemicals, and transport equipment.  \n \nThe United States and Israel have a close friendship based on common \ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. In 1948, the United States \nwas the first country to officially recognize Israel. In 1985, Israel and the United States \nconcluded a Free Trade Agreement designed to strengthen economic ties by \neliminating tariffs. The United States is Israel's largest trading partner. As of 2006, \n38.4% of Israel's exports went to the United States while 12.4% of its imports came from \nthe United States. In 2007, Israel imported $7.8 billion of goods from the United States \nand exported $18.9 billion to the United States.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIsrael is a prominent recipient of U.S. aid. Since 1949, the United States has \nprovided over $30 billion in economic assistance to Israel. Between 1976 and 2003, \nIsrael was the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid. In April 1988, the United States and \nIsrael established a Joint Economic Development Group to develop the Israeli economy \nby exchanging views on economic policy planning, stabilization efforts, and structural \nreform. The United States has also provided Israel with $9 billion in loan guarantees \nsince 2003, which enable Israel to borrow money from commercial lenders at a lower \nrate. \n \nAlthough the United States has often publicly committed to Israel's security and \nwell-being, Israel and the United States do not have a mutual defense agreement. In \n1989, Israel was one of the first countries designated a Major Non-NATO ally. As such, \nIsrael receives preferential treatment in bidding for U.S. defense contracts and access \nto expanded weapons systems at lower prices. Israel and the United States are \npartners in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d missile defense project, and have concluded numerous \ntreaties and agreements aimed at strengthening military ties, including agreements on \nmutual defense assistance, procurement, and security of information. Israel and the \nUnited States have established joint groups to further military cooperation. The two \ncountries participate in joint military exercises and collaborate on military research and \nweapons development. The United States has pledged to ensure that Israel maintains a \n\u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over its neighbors, and has been a major source of Israeli \nmilitary funding. Strong congressional support for Israel has resulted in Israel receiving \nbenefits not available to other countries. Israeli is permitted to use part of its foreign \nmilitary assistance grant for procurement spending from Israeli defense companies.  \n \n \nIsraeli and U.S. military and diplomatic goals are not always consistent. Although \narms agreements between Israel and the United States limit the use of U.S. military \nequipment to defensive purposes, the United States has rebuked Israel for possible \nimproper use of U.S.-supplied military equipment. The United States is concerned about \nIsraeli settlements, Israel's military sales to China, Israel's inadequate protection of U.S. \nintellectual property, and espionage-related cases implicating Israeli officials. In 2000, \nIsrael was listed as one of the nations aggressively targeting U.S. economic \nintelligence. There are several cases of U.S. citizens convicted for selling, or attempting \nto sell, classified documents to Israeli Embassy officials. There have also been \ninvestigations of the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of United States\u2019 \nrestricted, dual-use technology to Israel. \n \n \nImproper release of sensitive and proprietary information potentially threatens \nU.S. national security in both military and economic terms. Industrial espionage is \nintelligence-gathering \u201cconducted by a foreign government or by a foreign company with \ndirect assistance of a foreign government against a private U.S. company for the \npurpose of obtaining commercial secrets.\u201d Industrial espionage may target commercial \nsecrets of a civilian nature, or commercial secrets that have military applications, \nresulting in disclosure of sensitive technology that can be used to harm the United \nStates and its allies, and/or disclosure of classified information.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nTerrorist attacks are a continuing threat to Israel and to American interests in \nIsrael. Terrorists in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza have injured or killed U.S. tourists, \nstudents, residents, and mission personnel. Due to the volatile security environment in \nGaza and the West Bank, the United States continues to warn against any travel to \nthose areas. In June 2007, Hamas, a State Department-designated foreign terrorist \norganization, assumed control over Gaza and, in 2008, conflict between Hamas and \nIsrael resulted in the loss of hundreds of lives.  \n \nIn 1996, Israel and the United States signed a Counterterrorism Cooperation \nAccord, which established a joint counterterrorism group aimed at enhancing the \ncountries' capabilities to deter, respond to, and investigate international terrorist attacks \nor threats of international terrorist acts against Israel and the United States. The United \nStates is the principal international proponent of the Arab-Israeli peace process, and \nhas been actively involved in negotiating an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. With \nthe European Union, the United Nations, and Russia, the Bush administration was \nactive in attempting to negotiate agreements between Israel and the Palestinian \nauthority. The Obama administration has promised to continue to work for peace in the \nMiddle East. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States.\u201d  Such an individual \u201cmay be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  These disqualifying conditions are as follows: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and  \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nApplicant acquired a U.S. passport and renewed her Israeli passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 2002. She then used her Israeli passport to enter Israel in \n2004 and 2007, and she used her Israeli passport to enter Brazil in 2006. In 2009, she \nstated that she intended to renew her Israeli passport in the future. Applicant\u2019s \nacquisition of an Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen raises a concern that she \nactively exercises dual citizenship with Israel. Her use of her Israeli passport, instead of \nher U.S. passport, to enter Israel and Brazil also raises security concerns. Her \nexpressed intent to renew and to use her Israeli passport in the future suggests a \npreference for a foreign country over the United States. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nconduct raises potentially disqualifying security concerns under AG \u00b6 10 (a)(1) and \u00b6 \n10(b). \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 11(a), dual citizenship might be mitigated if \u201cit is based solely on [an \napplicant\u2019s] parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 11(b), an \nindividual\u2019s dual citizenship might be mitigated if he or she \u201chas expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 11(c), an individual\u2019s \u201cexercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship might be mitigated if it occurred before \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 11(d), an \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s use of a foreign passport might be mitigated if it were \u201capproved by the \ncognizant security authority.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 11(e), an individual\u2019s use of a foreign \npassport might be mitigated if he or she presents credible evidence that \u201cthe passport \nhas been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise \ninvalidated.\u201d \n \nApplicant acquired Israeli citizenship as a young adult when she emigrated from \nthe Soviet Union to Israel. After acquiring U.S. citizenship in 2002, she renewed her \nIsraeli passport in 2004. While she stated to an OPM investigator in 2008 that she \nwould renounce her Israeli citizenship if required to do so for access to classified \ninformation, she also stated in 2009 that she intended to renew her Israeli passport \nwhen it expired in the future. Nothing in the record supports a conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s use of her Israeli passport was approved by her cognizant security authority. \nAccordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), 11(d), and 11(e) do not apply in \nmitigation in this case. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The facts in this case raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation.\u201d \n \n \nWhile the United States and Israel share common democratic values, religious \nand cultural affinities, and security interests, the United States has concerns about \nIsrael\u2019s inadequate protection of U.S. intellectual property. Moreover, Israel is an active \ncollector of proprietary information and has targeted major U.S. government \norganizations in order to acquire U.S. technology.  Attempts have been made to illegally \n\n \n9 \n \n \nexport U.S. restricted, dual-use technology to Israel. American citizens with immediate \nfamily members who are citizens or residents of Israel could be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, inducements, or pressure by those seeking to acquire proprietary or \notherwise restricted U.S. technology. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband and child are dual citizens of Israel and the United States \nand reside in the United States with her. Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and sister are \ncitizens and residents of Israel. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a dual citizen of Israel and \nthe United States and resides in the United States. Additionally, Applicant has regular \nand frequent telephone contact with her parents and her sister in Israel.   \n \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with her spouse, her daughter, her parents and sister, \nand her father-in-law are neither casual nor infrequent, but are based on long-standing \nfamily ties of affection and obligation. She resides in the United States with her husband \nand daughter, who are dual citizens of the United States and Israel. Her husband\u2019s \nfather is also a dual citizen of the United States and Israel.  \n \nApplicant maintains an active Israeli passport so that she can travel to Israel to \nvisit her parents and sister, who are citizens and residents of Israel. Her family \nmembers have some idea of the nature of her work as a federal contractor, and this \ncould raise additional concerns that might also threaten U.S. security interests. \nApplicant failed to provide information to rebut or mitigate these security concerns. I \nconclude that the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) are \ninapplicable. \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested she was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant, who is a university \nprofessor, is an intelligent and well-educated professional with a specialty in computers \nand mathematics. After becoming a U.S. citizen, she renewed her Israeli passport and \nused it to enter Israel and Brazil. She intends to keep and renew her Israeli passport \nand use it when she wishes. She is in frequent contact with her family members who \nare citizens and residents of Israel. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nforeign preference and foreign influence adjudicative guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.: Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.e.: Against Applicant \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n                        Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Blank, Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nDecember 28, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 3, 2008 (Item 4).  On July 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 5, 2009, and requested\nthat a decision be made without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on September 18, 2009. The Applicant\nreceived the FORM on September 25, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any\nadditional information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. The case\n\n2\nwas assigned to me on December 4, 2009. Based upon a review of the written record,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 29 and single.  He served in the Marine Corps from 1998 until 2003.\n(Item 10.) He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits all of the subparagraphs in the SOR. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. Applicant submits, \u201cThe majority of\nthese [debts] span from the time I exited the Marine Corps in 2003 until my start at my\npresent job in 2006.\u201d He further submits that his plan is to pay his debts as his budget\npermits. (Item 2 at 1.) Applicant\u2019s responses to the nine allegations in the SOR follow.\n1.a.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a medical creditor in the amount of\n$335 since September 2005. In an answer to Interrogatories, Applicant states, \u201cWas\nfrom incident where I was shot. [State] Victims Assistance covered expense.\u201d (Item 6 at\n6.) He submitted no additional information to support this statement. The most recent\ncredit report in the record, dated July 13, 2009, shows this debt as due and owing. (Item\n9 at 1.) I find that this is Applicant\u2019s debt, that he has made no recent payments on this\ndebt, and there is no evidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.b.\nApplicant admits that he owes a collection agency $4,708 for a delinquent\ndebt originally owed to a financial institution. Applicant has made no recent payments\non this debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.c.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a finance agency in the amount of\n$4,033 for a repossessed automobile.

The most recent credit report in the record, dated July 13, 2009, shows\nthis debt as due and owing. (Item 9 at 2.) I find that this is Applicant\u2019s debt, that he has\nmade no recent payments on this debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to\nmake payments on this debt.\n1.d.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a financial institution in the amount\nof $9,775 for a repossessed automobile. Applicant has made no recent payments on\nthis debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.e.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for a delinquent\ndebt in the amount of $263 originally owed to a cable company.

Applicant had\npreviously stated that he had no knowledge of this account. (Item 6 at 4.) A credit report\ndated April 3, 2008, shows this debt to be due and owing. (Item 7 at 4.) I find that this is\nApplicant\u2019s debt, that he has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no\nevidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.h.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency for a delinquent\ndebt in the amount of $392 owed to a telephone company. Applicant had previously\nstated that he had no knowledge of this account. (Item 6 at 4.) A credit report dated\nApril 3, 2008, shows this debt to be due and owing. (Item 7 at 4.) I find that this is\nApplicant\u2019s debt, that he has made no recent payments on this debt, and there is no\nevidence that he is going to make payments on this debt.\n1.i.\nApplicant admits that he is indebted to a bank for a delinquent debt in the\namount of $6,176 since June 2001. Applicant had previously stated that his mother\nopened this account without his knowledge. (Item 5 at 3.) A credit report dated April 3,\n2008, shows this debt to be due and owing and a joint contractual liability. (Item 7 at 4.)\nBased on the totality of the evidence, I find that this is Applicant\u2019s debt, that he has\nmade no recent payments on this debt, and there is no evidence that he is going to\nmake payments on this debt.\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\n\n4\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n5\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, has over $26,000 in past-due debts, all of which have been due and owing for\nseveral years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose recently, primarily between about 2003 and 2006. In addition,\nApplicant has submitted nothing to show that he has paid any of his creditors, or has a\nplan to pay his creditors. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that his\nfinancial situation has improved.  He has not done so.  This mitigating condition is not\napplicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  Applicant submits that he had to leave the Armed Forces\nbefore he wished to do so because of a medical condition, and then suffered several\nyears of underemployment. He also states, without documentary support, that he\nsuffered two deaths in his family and had to financially support family members. There\nis little to no evidence, however, that Applicant acted responsibly since he became\nemployed in the defense industry in 2006. This mitigating condition is also not\napplicable to this case.\nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  There is no\nrecord of his making any payments.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally,\ngiven the fact that he is $26,000 in debt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\n\n6\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is under financial strain,\nand has been so for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(3), the Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot\nfind that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, at the present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation at this time. \nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn July 7, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on August 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 1, 2009, and\nan amended notice of hearing was issued on September 18, 2009.  I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on September 25, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government\noffered Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified\non his own behalf and submitted no documents. One additional witness testified on\nbehalf of Applicant. \n\n2\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, the record remained open until October 9, 2009, to allow\nApplicant to submit documents. Documents were received from Applicant in a timely\nmanner, including a letter, written by Applicant to Trans Union on February 9, 2009, and\nmarked as Exhibit A, and three character letters, identified as Exhibit B. Both exhibits\nhave been entered into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on October 8, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 35 years old. He has been married to his current wife since 2005,\nand he was previously married from 1994 until 2000. Applicant is employed by a\ndefense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 29 allegations (1.a. through 1.cc.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts.

However, he did not know on which of the\ndebts he had made payments (Tr at 27-30).  As discussed above, the record remained\nopen until October 9, 2009, for Applicant to offer documentation to establish on which\ndebts he had made payments and the amount of payment made. While some\ndocumentation was offered into evidence, no evidence was submitted to show that any\npayments had been made on any debts. The debts will be discussed in the same order\nas they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $397.

No evidence\nwas offered to show Applicant made any payments on this debt. I find this debt is still\ndue and owing. \n\n5\n1.cc. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $711. Exhibit A\nshows that Applicant disputed this debt. However, no evidence was submitted to show\nthat this debt has been resolved. Therefore, I find that Applicant owes this debt. \nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties occurred because of a number of\nfactors including: making poor financial choices, a previous marriage and subsequent\ndivorce, being employed in the field of construction, which can be unstable, and having\nto take care of his wife and their seven children (Tr at 38-39).\nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) on July\n18, 2008 (Exhibit 1). Question 28.a. asks, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed\nno debts. The Government alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed\nin the SOR as 1.a. through 1.aa., above. I find that Applicant should have included all of\nthe debts listed on the SOR.\n2.b. Question 28.b. of the SCA asks, \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question, and he listed no debts. The\nGovernment alleges that Applicant should have included the debts listed in the SOR as\nas 1.a. through 1.aa., above. I find that Applicant should have also included all of the\ndebts listed on the SOR.\nDuring cross examination by Department Counsel, Applicant conceded that he\nknew he had overdue debts when he completed the SCA, but since he did not know all\nof them, he simply answered that he had no overdue debts. He contended that he was\nnot aware that he had the option to at least admit that he had overdue debts, but explain\nthat he was not aware of all of the overdue debts (Tr at 40-41). Applicant also conceded\nthat he never inquired as to how he should complete the SCA, if he was not aware of all\nof his debts (Tr at 50-51).\nOne witness testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. This individual has worked with\nApplicant in the past, and he described Applicant as a \u201cstraight up family guy.\u201d However,\nthe witness was unaware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties and overdue debts, so I\nconsider his testimony to be of limited value. \nApplicant offered into evidence three letters from an individuals who know\nApplicant in his private life (Exhibit B). They all wrote in positive terms about Applicant,\ndescribing him as \u201cvery dependable, reliable, hard-working, conscientious, and honest.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n7\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay his obligations for a considerable period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\n Since no independent evidence was offered to establish that Applicant has\nresolved any of his very significant debt, I do not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC)\nis applicable. I conclude that until he is able to significantly reduce this debt, and\nestablish a more stable financial picture, he has not mitigated the financial concerns of\nthe Government.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\n       With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant knowingly\nprovided incorrect, untruthful, incomplete material information to the Government on the\nSCA that he executed on July 18, 2008. Because of his lack of honesty and candor\nregarding very clearly written questions, I find that Applicant did intend to mislead the\nGovernment.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DCs) under Guideline E,  I conclude\nthat because Applicant deliberately omitted and concealed relevant facts from an SCA\nthat DC 16. (a) applies against Applicant. I find no MCs can be applied. I therefore,\nresolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n\n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition applies\nunder Guidelines F and E, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant\nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\n        Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.cc.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a .and 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant accrued nine delinquent debts, totaling more than $20,000, from 2002\nto 2008. Four additional debts, totaling almost $3,000, were reported as delinquent on a\nJuly 2009 credit report. He demonstrated no effort to resolve any of these debts, and\nprovided no evidence to establish ongoing solvency or otherwise mitigate security\nconcerns. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 23, 2008.  On April\n1\n23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nDecember 23, 2009\n\nItem 2.\n3\nThe Government submitted ten Items in support of the SOR allegations.\n4\nItem 2 at 3; Item 3 at 6, 11, 17-19, 25.\n5\nItem 2. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c., and admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.d. through 1.i..\n6\nItem 7; Item 8.\n7\nItem 2 at 2; Item 4 at 4-5, 13, 14. \n8\nItem 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.\n9\n2\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within\nthe Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 1, 2009, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 9, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non July 20, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. He submitted no further evidence or\ncorrespondence in response to the FORM by the August 19, 2009, deadline and\nexpressed no objection to my consideration of the evidence submitted by Department\nCounsel. I received the case assignment on October 9, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he began\nworking in March 2004. He has no military service, and has never held a security\nclearance. He is recently married with no children.  In his response to the SOR, he\n5\nformally admitted each allegation, except for two small claims court judgments of which\nhe claimed ignorance.  Applicant\u2019s admissions, including his statements in response to\n6\nthe SOR and to DOHA interrogatories, are incorporated in the following findings.\nThe two small claims court judgments that Applicant denied in his SOR response\nwere entered against him on February 24, 2003, in the amount of $2,306, and on\nDecember 5, 2006, in the amount of $597.  Other than stating that he was not aware of\n7\nthese judgments, he provided no evidence that either judgment was erroneously\nrecorded or satisfied.  The judgment and six other SOR-alleged debts to which he\n8\nadmitted became delinquent between 2002 and 2008, and total $17,468.  Accordingly,\n9\n\nItem 4 at 3, 5.\n10\nItem 4 at 16.\n11\nItem 2.\n12\nItem 10.\n13\n3\nthe evidence clearly establishes that Applicant owes these three judgments and six\nother delinquent debts totaling $20,371. \nApplicant offered no corroborating evidence of any payment toward, or other\nattempt to resolve, any of these debts. In his August 2008 statement to an interviewer\nfrom the Office of Personnel Management, he stated that the debts were incurred due to\nhis financial irresponsibility, but that he had become more responsible and was going to\ntake steps to fix his credit.  In his December 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories,\n10\nApplicant stated:\nMy credit sucks. I plan on trying to fix some of it but live paycheck to\npaycheck as is. I have way too many outstanding debts to fix all at once.\nMy New Years Resolution is to start tracking what debts I know about, and\nget calls/mail about to fix.  \n11\nHis May 2009 SOR response, however, indicated neither any effort nor the financial\nability to resolve any of his delinquent debts.  DOHA obtained another credit report on\n12\nJuly 9, 2009, which showed another judgment against him in April 2009 for $1,335. This\nreport also listed three new debts that became delinquent between May and September\n2008, totaling $1,652, and did not show resolution or reduction of any SOR-alleged\ndebt.13\nApplicant submitted no evidence about his current income, living expenses, or\nability to resolve his delinquent debts and avoid incurring additional ones. He provided\nno evidence concerning the quality of his recent professional performance, the level of\nresponsibility his duties entail, or his track record with respect to handling sensitive\ninformation and observation of security procedures. He submitted no character\nreferences or other evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or\nreliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person\nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\nFORM at 5.\n14\n5\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nDepartment Counsel argued that the evidence established security concerns\nunder two Guideline F DCs, as set forth in AG \u00b6 19: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  Applicant has\n14\nbeen unwilling and unable to satisfy any of his delinquent debts, and failed to provide\nany evidence of his willingness or ability to do so in the future. DC 19(a) is clearly\nestablished. He has demonstrated a seven-year history of not meeting financial\nobligations, including a pattern of borrowing and spending beyond his means even after\nbecoming aware of the security concerns raised by such conduct. Security concerns\nunder DC 19(c) are also supported on this record. Applicant\u2019s current financial state and\nhistory of irresponsibility indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, and unwillingness\nto abide by rules and regulations. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties in AG \u00b6 20. Under MC 20(a), disqualifying conditions\nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial irresponsibility is recent, involves numerous creditors, and continues to date.\nHe remains substantially in debt, and he provided no evidence concerning his current\nfinancial situation that would support a finding that delinquent indebtedness is unlikely to\nrecur. The evidence does not support application of this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder MC 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant has worked\nfull-time for his present employer for almost six years, and made no effort to address\nany of his delinquencies. He attributes them to his own carelessness and\nirresponsibility, and offered no evidence that any debt was incurred due to causes\nbeyond his control. He also did not demonstrate that he responsibly reduced non-\nessential spending in reaction to his mounting debts. He has not established mitigation\nof his presently delinquent debts, or of his financial history as a whole, under this\nprovision.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under MC 20(c). Similarly, MC 20(d) applies where the evidence\nshows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\u201d Applicant established no mitigation under these two provisions because\nhe failed to address any delinquency. He further incurred four additional bad debts,\ntotaling $2,987, after those listed in the SOR. Moreover, the absence of evidence\n\n6\ndemonstrating his current solvency or ability to resolve his outstanding delinquencies\nprecludes findings of \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol,\u201d or \u201ca good-faith effort.\u201d Insufficient evidence was presented to alleviate the\nsubstantial security concerns raised by the length and degree of financial irresponsibility\nthat continues to date. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature\nindividual who is responsible for his voluntary choices and conduct that underlie the\nsecurity concerns expressed in the SOR. He established a consistent pattern of\nfinancial irresponsibility dating back at least seven years, with no evidence of any efforts\nto resolve his outstanding obligations. \nApplicant failed to demonstrate financial rehabilitation or evidence of solvency\nfrom the present time forward, so recurrence and worsening of his financial concerns\ncannot be said to be unlikely. He continues to bear financial obligations for significant\npast debt and ongoing living expenses. He accordingly remains subject to pressure,\nexploitation, or duress. The record contains insufficient other evidence about his\ncharacter, trustworthiness, or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or tending to\nmake their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I deny Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) version of a security clearance application (SF-86) on August 1, 2005. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) on June 23, 2010, detailing security concerns under Guideline D,\nSexual Conduct, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\nMay 31, 2011\n\nAE B - AE E.\n1\n2\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant received the SOR on July 6, 2010. He answered the SOR on July 15,\n2010. Department Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge and was\nprepared to proceed on November 29, 2010. DOHA assigned this case to another\nadministrative judge on December 14, 2010, and for workload considerations,\nreassigned the case to me on March 2, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nMarch 15, 2011, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 6, 2011. The\nGovernment offered exhibits marked as GE 1 through GE 5, which were received and\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. He submitted exhibits\nmarked as AE A through AE F, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 13, 2011. I held the record\nopen until April 21, 2011, for Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant timely\nsubmitted AE G through AE K, without objection. The record closed on April 21, 2011.\nProcedural Ruling\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on April 5, 2011, less than 15 days before\nthe hearing. I advised Applicant of his right in \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive the\nnotice 15 days before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15-day\nnotice. (Tr. 10.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the\nSOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of\nfact.  \nApplicant, who is 55 years old, works as a telecommunications technician for a\ncontractor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). He has\nworked for NASA contractors since October 1998. Applicant\u2019s manager and co-workers\ndescribe him as an individual who follows company policies and procedures and who\npays attention to detail. His manager considers him a \u201cmodel employee\u201d and his co-\nworkers consider him an outstanding technician. He works well with his colleagues. He\nis well-respected by them. All recommend him for a security clearance and do not\nconsider him a threat to national security.1\nApplicant graduated from high school and attended a vocational school, where\nhe received training in electronic communications. He also participated in job-related\ntraining over four years, which resulted in a communications engineer certificate. He\n\nGE 1; GE 2; Tr. 21-23.\n2\nGE 5.\n3\nId.\n4\nAE A; AE G; AE H.\n5\n3\nattended college, but has not graduated. He married in 1987 and divorced in 1997. He\nhas one son, who is 23 years old. He has a step-daughter. He is active in his church\nand sings in the church choir.  \n2\nOn August 3, 2006, Applicant\u2019s 15-year-old cousin spent the night with him. His\ncousin and he slept in the same bed. During the night, Applicant engaged in a sexual\nact with his young cousin. The cousin reported the incident to his parents several weeks\nlater, and his parents contacted the police. After an investigation, the grand jury indicted\nApplicant for sexual assault of a child, age 14 to 17, a second degree felony in\nDecember 2006.3\nApplicant appeared in court on January 3, 2007 with counsel, He pled guilty to a\nsingle charge of sexual assault of a child, age 14 to 17,  a second degree felony. The\ncourt deferred adjudication of guilt and placed Applicant on community supervision for\neight years and fined him $500. The court placed numerous restrictions on his\nmovement during his probation, including a prohibition against committing additional\noffenses; involvement with injurious habits, such as drugs and alcohol; travel\nrestrictions; random alcohol and drug testing; gainful employment; 350 hours of\ncommunity service at the rate of 10 hours a month; numerous fees; alcohol and drug\nevaluation; sex offender registration; participation in a sex offender treatment program;\nno contact with the victim; no contact with a minor under the age of 17; staying at least\n1000 feet from where children gather; no employment involving children; avoid\npornographic material; and 30 days confinement in jail.  \n4\nApplicant\u2019s probation officer verified that Applicant is in compliance with the\nconditions of his supervision and probation. His probation officer and his counselor, a\nlicensed clinical social worker, indicate that he has accepted responsibility for his\nactions on August 3, 2006. Once a year, Applicant undergoes a clinical polygraph\nexamination related to his sexual activities. He provided copies of the polygraph reports\ndated May 21, 2009 and September 30, 2010. Both reports reflect questions asked\nabout his sexual activities with anyone under age 17. The examiner found no deception\nby Applicant on his \u201cno\u201d answers.5\nApplicant attends weekly group counseling sessions for sex offenders. His\ncounselor operates this program. Once a year, he meets with his counselor for an\nevaluation of his progress. She files a report with his probation officer. His counselor\nadvises that he has been in treatment since January 2007, has been a model\nprobationer, cooperated with all treatment efforts, and developed a viable relapse\nprevention plan. Based on court records, polygraphs, and urinalysis, Applicant does not\n\nAE A; AE J; Tr. 28, 31.\n6\nAE K; Tr. 24-36.\n7\n4\nhave any other legal problems, a substance abuse problem, and no diagnosis of mental\nillness or personality disorder. He has responded well to the cognitive-behavior\ntreatment approach to his recovery. In her opinion, Applicant poses a minimal risk to\nsociety for re-offending. She believes that he does not pose a risk for protecting\nclassified information. In her annual report to his probation officer, she indicated that\nApplicant\u2019s overall progress in his treatment was about 60% and outlined the goals he\nhad achieved, including accepting responsibility for his offense and identifying his\nemotional issues. She further made other recommendations related to improving his\nprogress for successful completion of his treatment program. She provides an overall\nfavorable prognosis for Applicant.6\nAt the hearing Applicant described himself as an average guy, \u201cwho loves the\nLord, his son, his family, and his country.\u201d He acknowledged his conduct, saying that he\ndid \u201csomething horrible\u201d and describing his conduct as \u201cterrible\u201d. He sincerely regrets his\nconduct, and states he will regret his conduct for the rest of his life. He provided specific\ninformation about his weekly therapy sessions and advised about the polygraph tests.\nHe talked about techniques and boundaries he has developed to prevent a future\noffense. His family and church members are aware of his conduct and probationary\nstatus. His brother and one sister attended a chaperone class with him as part of his\ntreatment. The class also included his counselor and probation officer. The class\nprovided them with skills to protect young children and to notice Applicant\u2019s behavior.\nThey love their brother and talk openly with him about this incident. Applicant admitted\nan early incident in 1978 when he was 26 years old, which involved sexual\nexperimentation with a 16-year-old male cousin. He stated that he did not come to the\nhearing to defend his conduct, but to show that he was not a security risk. Because he\nis a registered sex offender and those closest to him and involved in his life know about\nhis conduct, he cannot be coerced. He remains on probation.  \n7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n5\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern as:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 13 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nIn 2006, as an adult, Applicant engaged in sexual conduct with a child between\nthe ages of 14 and 17, which is a crime. While his conduct did not occur in a public\nplace, it shows a lack of judgment and placed him in a position of being vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. The Government established its case under the above\ndisqualifying conditions.\nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have\nconsidered all the conditions, and the following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and\n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress.\nWhile one incident occurred in 1978, more than 30 years ago, the second\nincident happened four and one-half years ago. Because he again became involved in\nsexual conduct with a child, AG \u00b6 14(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant is currently participating in a sex offender\u2019s treatment program and has\nbeen in this program for more than four years. He accepted responsibility for his\nconduct in 2006 and in 1978. He discusses his conduct with his family members and\nhas made his church members aware of what he has done. As required, he registered\nas a sex offender. He complies with the requirements of his probation. With his\nopenness about his conduct and his registration as a sex offender, there is little\nlikelihood that he can be coerced, pressured, exploited, or placed under duress for his\npast sexual conduct. AG \u00b6 14(c) has some applicability.\n\n7\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\nApplicant pled guilty to a second degree felony offense in 2007 after he engaged\nin a sexual act with his 15-year-old cousin. The court placed him on probation for eight\nyears, which will end in January 2015. The Government has established the above\ndisqualifying conditions.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have\nconsidered all the mitigating conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nMore than 30 years has elapsed since the first incident involving sexual conduct\nwith a child between the age of 14 and 17. While this incident occurred many years ago,\nApplicant again engaged in sexual conduct with an underage child less than five years\nago, which raises concerns about his judgment. Based on the statements from his\nmanager and co-workers, his reliability and trustworthiness at work are not an issue.\nApplicant admitted his conduct in court and has accepted responsibility for his\nactions. He attends his group therapy sessions every week and has willingly\nparticipated in these sessions. He works with his counselor on emotional issues to\nprevent a reoccurrence. He works steadily and is highly respected at his job for his\ntechnical skills. He complies with the requirements of his probation. His counselor and\n\n8\nfamily do not consider him a threat. He has a strong support system as he progresses\nforward in his treatment and management of his conduct. Applicant has presented\nstrong evidence that he is being rehabilitated. However, he still remains on probation.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nsexual conduct with his 15-year-old cousin in 2006 and with a 16-year-old cousin in\n1978 is serious and egregious. He recognizes this, and he has accepted responsibility\nfor his conduct. He willingly and actively participates in his group therapy sessions. With\nthe assistance of his counselor and therapy sessions, he has developed a strong\nsupport system through his family and church to help him manage his emotions in a\npositive way, which will prevent a future reoccurrence. He has complied with all the\nmany requirements of his probation, including no involvement with children 17 or\nyounger and registering as a sex offender. He is to be commended for the efforts he\nhas taken and his success over the last four years in understanding his behavior. He is\nwell-respected at his job. The evidence in this case reflects that he cannot be coerced,\nexploited, pressured or placed under duress for his sexual and criminal conduct.\n\n9\nHowever, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised because he\nremains on probation, which does not end until January 2015. Of concern, is the fact\nthat he engaged in wrongful conduct, not once, but twice. The second occurrence\nhappened many years after the first, and this fact alone raises concerns about his\njudgment. He needs additional time and treatment to learn to fully manage his emotions\nin stressful situations and to learn to prevent his conduct in the future.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his sexual and\ncriminal conduct under Guidelines D and J.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \non May 5, 2009 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 21, 2009. \nDuring the hearing, the government offered three exhibits, marked as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified, and offered nine exhibits, which were marked as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through I and admitted without objection. He did not present \nwitnesses. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocumentation. Applicant timely submitted four documents, which Department \nCounsel forwarded without objection. I admitted the documents as AE J through \nM. DOHA received the transcript on June 22, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, \nand the evidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant, 38 years old, completed some college courses in 1992 but did \nnot earn a degree. He is currently employed as a network engineer for a defense \ncontractor. He married in 1993 and divorced in 2005. His three daughters, ages \n9, 11 and 15 years, and his son, age 13, live with their mother in another state \n(GE 1; Tr. 27-28, 100). \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in \nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations \nin which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant's Answer included three documents that will be identified as follows: Answer \nDocument (AD) 1: May 2008 letter from a creditor regarding deficiency balance on repossessed \nautomobile (allegation 1.j.); AD 2: 1099-A form regarding mortgage (allegation 1.i.); AD 3: August \n2008 worksheet regarding Applicant's child support (allegation 1.m.).  \n\n \n 3  \n                                                     \n \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife separated in approximately August 2004. He \nlived apart from them but paid the house payments and costs, and his family\u2019s \nliving expenses. Following their divorce in 2005, Applicant and his ex-wife were \ninvolved in lengthy legal proceedings until approximately August 2008. He paid \nalimony of $800 per month from 2005 to 2007, as well as child support and his \nwife\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees. Applicant's child support obligation has varied. In 2005, his \nobligation was $1,715 per month; in July 2007, it was $2,420 per month. He \nsought relief from the court as to the amount. In the Final Order of August 2008, \nthe court ordered child support of $619 biweekly,4 or approximately $1,238 per \nmonth. Applicant testified that the divorce \u201cfinancially ruined me.\u201d He used credit \ncards and charge accounts to pay his expenses, legal fees and attorneys\u2019 costs. \nThe delinquencies on these accounts, alleged in the SOR, amount to more than \n$70,000. Applicant testified that he had sound credit before his divorce, and his \ncredit bureau reports show that all the debts alleged in the SOR started \nbecoming delinquent in 2007, during the legal battle (GE 1, 2, 3; AE B, D, F, G; \nTr. 31, 74, 84-88). \n \n \nApplicant was awarded the house as part of the divorce settlement, after \npaying his ex-wife her share of the home\u2019s value. His credit bureau report of \nDecember 2007 shows that he had a first mortgage of $307,092 and a second \nmortgage of $182,300. Applicant decided to keep the house because the housing \nmarket was strong, and he hoped its value would increase. He could sell it at a \nsignificant profit, and use the proceeds to pay his debts. However, the real estate \nmarket deteriorated in 2006, and he was unable to sell. The mortgage company \nforeclosed, and the property was sold in December 2007. Applicant was issued a \nForm 1099-A, \u201cAcquisition of Abandonment of Secured Property,\u201d showing \nApplicant had an outstanding balance of $307,092, and the property had a fair \nmarket value of $571,226. Applicant submitted two trustee\u2019s deeds showing the \nhome sold on December 19, 2007 for $319,000, and was sold again on \nDecember 28, 2007 for $185,179. Applicant testified that these sales resulted in \na total of about $500,000, which was more than the $487,000 he owed. \nAccordingly, he has no remaining deficiency on the mortgage loans. His \nDecember 2008 credit bureau report shows the foreclosure on the first mortgage, \nand charge-off of the second mortgage balance (AD 2; GE 2, 3; AE H; Tr. 34-38, \n84-88).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $92,800. After deductions, including $1,238 \nper month child support, his net monthly take-home pay is approximately $2,920. \nHe has been living with his parents since October 2007 to save money. He pays \nno rent, but does pay $300 per month to store his goods. In his personal financial \nstatement (PFS) of December 2008, he listed monthly expenses, (excluding the \nchild support that is included in his deductions) of $2,280. He testified that he \nincluded expenses that occur annually but not necessarily every month. He also \n \n4 Applicant received a credit of $619 per month to cover eight trips to visit his children in the state \nin which they now live (AE L). \n\n \n 4  \nlisted a $950 travel expense to visit his children, which he testified is court-\nordered at once per month. He currently has a corporate credit card and is a co-\nsigner on a card with his parents. These accounts are current. Under his debts, \nhe listed attorney\u2019s fees of $700 per month, and his corporate credit card \npayment of $1,000 per month. At the hearing, he estimated a monthly net \nremainder, after expenses, of approximately $450 to $500. On his PFS, he did \nnot list payments on any of the debts listed in the SOR. (GE 2; AE J; Tr. 67, 83, \n127)  \n \n \nApplicant has sought assistance from financial attorneys over the past two \nyears. He was advised not to file a bankruptcy petition, but to seek relief in the \nform of lower child support payments. He is currently working with an attorney \nwho advised him to attend a credit counseling course, which Applicant completed \nshortly before the hearing. Applicant admitted that he does not have a plan in \nplace to deal with his debts (Tr. 90-101).  \n \n \nThe status of Applicant's remaining debts follows.   \n \n$ \nCharge accounts - $18,693 (allegations 1.a., 1.e., and 1.g.) \nCredit cards - $54,975 (allegations 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f.); \nLine of credit - $2,277 (allegation 1.n.). Applicant used these \naccounts to pay his expenses during his separation, divorce and \nchild custody proceedings. They became delinquent in 2007. \nApplicant has not contacted the creditors to establish payment \nplans and the accounts remain unresolved (GE 2, 3; Tr. 100). \n \n\u2022 \nAuto loan - $33,585 (allegation 1.j.). After Applicant voluntarily \nsurrendered the car, the creditor sold it. He provided a May \n2008 letter from the creditor showing that he owes a deficiency \nbalance of $14,700. Applicant admits that he owes this \ndelinquent debt, and denies the amount listed in the SOR. He \nhas not been in touch with the creditor since he received the \n2008 letter (AD 1; Tr. 38-40, 111-113). \n \n$   \nCitation - $200 (allegation 1.k.). Applicant was cited for failure to \ndisplay current license tags, which he disputed. He provided \nevidence that he paid the fine on the day of the hearing (AE K; \nTr. 134-137). \n \n$   \nAttorney fees - $7,000 (allegation 1.l.). Applicant owes his wife\u2019s \ndivorce attorney the alleged amount, as well as an additional \n$9,000, for a total of $16,000. He has been paying $500 per \nmonth, and provided evidence of payments made in 2008 and \n2009 (AE F, G, I, M; Tr. 137-140). \n \n$        Child support - $2,485 (allegation 1.m.). When Applicant and his \nwife separated, he paid child support directly to his wife. Later, \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \nas part of the divorce order, Applicant was required to pay the \nsupport through the state child support enforcement agency, and \nhis pay was garnished. The date that the agency expected \npayment to be made did not fall on the dates that the child \nsupport was disbursed from Applicant's pay. Because of this \ndiscrepancy in dates, it appeared in most months that Applicant \nhad not paid his child support and was in arrears. In fact, the \ncorrect child support payments were being automatically \ndeducted from his pay every two weeks. I find that Applicant was \nnot negligent in meeting his child support obligation (AE B, C, D, \nE, J; Tr. 42-59). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-\nsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect \nconsideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred \nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. \nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information \n \n5 Directive 6.3 \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n 6  \n                                                     \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a \nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant was unable to meet his financial \nobligations in 2007, and most of these debts remain unpaid, indicating a history \nof not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 7  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant's indebtedness is not infrequent\u2014the SOR cites 14 debts\u2014nor \ndid they occur in the distant past, as most of them remain unpaid. Applicant's \nfailure to set in place any kind of payment plan for the majority of his SOR debts \ncasts doubt on his good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nThe circumstances that caused Applicant to become indebted were \nbeyond his control. The record shows that Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts started in \n2007, after his divorce, and stem largely from that unforeseen event. However, \nthis mitigating condition also requires that an Applicant act responsibly when \nconfronted with such situations. Here, Applicant has a substantial amount of debt \nthat he has made little effort to resolve. Although he sought financial guidance, \nhe did not use the attorneys\u2019 expertise to help him set up a plan to pay the \n$70,000 in credit card debt or the almost $15,000 deficient balance on his auto \nloan. Despite the significant debt that was accruing because of his separation \nand divorce, he waited to sell his house. Currently, he has a payment plan in \nplace for only two debts (child support and attorney\u2019s fee), and he paid one small \ndebt on the day of the hearing. Applicant's failure to establish a more \ncomprehensive plan to deal with his substantial indebtedness is not responsible, \nand he receives only partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \n \nNeither can AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) be applied. Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is not under control. He owes approximately $90,000. Most of the SOR \ndebts are unpaid, with no substantiated payment plans in place. Without \nevidence of a comprehensive plan to resolve debts, a good-faith effort cannot be \nsubstantiated.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant receives some mitigation based on AG \u00b6 20(b), I \nconclude that it is insufficient to outweigh the disqualifying conditions. I find \nagainst Applicant under Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and \nhave applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have \nalso reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n 8  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the \nappropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nWhen Applicant's debts started to become delinquent, he was a mature \nand experienced father and husband 36 years of age. Applicant maintained solid \ncredit before his divorce. However, the significant legal fees from his protracted \nlegal battles, and the court-ordered alimony and child support, were \ncircumstances that Applicant did not foresee. In addition, his anticipated profit \nfrom his home sale disappeared following the housing market collapse.  \n \n \nBecause of these circumstances, Applicant found it difficult to meet his \nobligations, and numerous debts became delinquent in 2007. However, Applicant \ndid not demonstrate a responsible approach to dealing with his mounting debt. \nDespite a substantial income, he made no attempt to resolve his $70,000 in \ncredit card debt or his auto loan deficiency. He did not file bankruptcy, which can \noffer a legitimate path to resolving insurmountable debt. He postponed selling his \nhouse despite his high levels of child support, alimony and legal fees.  \n \n \nAmong those who apply for security clearances, Applicant has \naccumulated an exceptionally high amount of delinquent debt. He does have a \npayment plan in place for two debts, and he did paid one small debt\u2014on the day \nof the hearing. However, the two large debts that are paid or being paid\u2014the \nmortgage loans and the child support\u2014are paid through the action of the \nmortgage lender, or the state, rather than Applicant. He did not set up payment \nplans or provide evidence to show good-faith efforts to resolve his remaining \ndebts. As a result, he still carries about $90,000 in delinquencies, with no \ndocumented plan in place to resolve it. An applicant is not required to be debt-\nfree, or establish that he paid every debt. But he must demonstrate that he \nestablished a plan to resolve his debts and has taken significant action to \nimplement that plan. Considering that Applicant has not established such a plan, \nit would be premature at this point in time to grant him access to classified \ninformation. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n\n \n 9  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by \nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.g.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h. \u2013 1.i. \n \nFor Applicant   \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k. \u2013 1.m.  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n.  \n \nAgainst Applicant   \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to allow Applicant access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s finances Between 1995 and 2008, Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts (see item 5). Three of the largest debts involve federal and state tax liens. Records show that a federal tax lien in the amount of $16,614 (creditor 1.e) was entered against Applicant in June 2003 (item 5). Records also show that two state tax liens were entered against Applicant: one in March 1995 for $1,787 and another in June 1998 for $1,099. According to Applicant\u2019s latest credit report, none of these tax liens have been released (item 5).

Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on April 24, 2009, and did not supplement the record. The case was\nassigned to me on June 18, 2009.   Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings and\nexhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nAugust 5, 2009\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) accumulated eight delinquent\nconsumer debts exceeding $18,000; (b) had an adverse judgment entered against him\nin September 2005, in the amount of $2,005; (c) had tax liens (one federal lien and two\nstate lines) filed against him totaling in excess of $19,000; and (d) listed expenses in\nexcess of income on a personal financial statement (DSS Form 154) he completed in\nDecember 2008.\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified the security clearance\napplication (e-QIP) he completed in February 2008 by omitting the following: the tax\nliens placed against his property within the past seven years, an unsatisfied judgment\nentered against him, debts delinquent over 180 days in the past seven years, and debts\ncurrently 90 days delinquent.  \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nexplained that he answered in the negative to the e-QIP he completed thinking of the\npayments he was behind in, and not realizing at the time that he needed to calculate\nwhat was owed (see item 3). \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old driver for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.

Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in March 1984 and divorced in June 1996 (see item 4).  He has\nthree adult children from this marriage (item 4).

Three of the largest debts involve federal and state tax liens.  Records\nshow that a federal tax lien in the amount of $16,614 (creditor 1.e) was entered against\nApplicant in June 2003 (item 5).  Records also show that two state tax liens were\nentered against Applicant: one in March 1995 for $1,787 and another in June 1998 for\n$1,099.  According to Applicant\u2019s latest credit report, none of these tax liens have been\nreleased (item 5). \nBesides the tax liens, records document that a judgment was entered against\nApplicant by creditor 1.d in September 2005 for $2,005. Applicant rented an apartment\nfrom creditor 1.d in 2003 (see item 7).  When Applicant was late in his rent in November\n2006, this creditor filed a complaint to recover two months of  back rent, interest and\npenalties (item 7). Creditor 1.d obtained a judgment against Applicant.  Applicant claims\n\n3\nhe made arrangements to make monthly payments to this judgment creditor, at the rate\nof $100 a month, and has since reduced the amount owing on the judgment to\napproximately $1,200 (item. 7). He does not provide any documentation of his\npayments, however, and still owes in excess of $2,000 according to his latest credit\nreport (item 5).  \nDuring his 28 years of military service, between 1972 and July 2000,  Applicant\ncreated a number of consumer-related delinquent debts.  Applicant\u2019s credit report lists\neight consumer-related debts exceeding $18,000 (see item 5). Applicant claims some of\nthe debts represent duplicates but provides no evidence of disputing any of these debts\nwith either the credit reporting agencies or the disputed creditors themselves. \nBy and large, Applicant attributes his debt delinquencies to child support issues.\nRising child support obligations have limited his ability to pay his other debts (see item\n7). Approximately $225 has been garnished from his wages bi-weekly, and his\narrearage currently exceeds $50,000.  As interest continues to accrue on his child\nsupport arrearage, Applicant can provide no estimate of when he will be able to\neliminate the arrearage (item 7). \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to insufficient trucking assignments\nand heavy child support obligations (see item 7). Applicant does not provide any more\nspecific explanations of his accrued tax liens, the adverse judgment against him, or the\nother delinquent consumer debts listed in his latest credit report.  He does not indicate\nwhether he has received financial counseling or considered debt consolidation.\nClaiming he is on a payment plan with the IRS to resolve his tax lien, he does not\nprovide any documentation of his payment efforts or any corrective steps he has taken\nto resolve any of his other tax liens, the judgment, and the delinquent consumer debts.  \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement in December 2008.  In his\nstatement, he listed net monthly income of $2,631.14, monthly expenses of $2,978.95,\nand debts that exceeded $16,000 (excluding his tax liens and judgment).  He listed no\nassets in his statement and a VA disability of $116 a month (see item 7).\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions\nAsked to complete an e-QIP in February 2008, Applicant omitted (a) his federal\nand state tax liens, (b) the judgment entered against him in September 2005, and (c) his\nadmitted debts over 180 days delinquent and currently 90 days delinquent.  Applicant\ndid not provide any explanations for his omissions. \nThe questions covering Applicant\u2019s omissions are fairly straight forward.  Without\nany credible explanations of why he omitted the listed  liens, judgment, and delinquent\ndebts, adverse inferences are warranted that he omitted them deliberately and not as\nthe result of any good-faith mistake or misunderstanding. \n\n4\nSeveral months later (in June 2008), Applicant was interviewed by an\ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Close review of the\nsummary of interview by the interviewing agent confirms that the interview was\nscheduled to discuss Applicant\u2019s finances.  The summary details the agent\u2019s discussion\nof Applicant\u2019s listed debts in his credit report and the circumstances under which they\narose.  While it is not clear whether the agent confronted Applicant with his credit report\nor other indicators of accrued debts, there is nothing in the report to indicate that\nApplicant volunteered the information about his liens, judgment, and delinquent debts\nwithout the benefit of prompting questions. \nEndorsements\nApplicant did not provide any endorsements or other evidence of his\ncontributions to his employer and community.  Potentially helpful to Applicant in\nevaluating his overall contributions and trustworthiness would be his performance\nevaluations, achievement awards, training certificates, and meritorious citations.  None\nwere provided in Applicant\u2019s SOR response, and he did not choose to provide any in\nresponse to the FORM.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommon-sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\n\n5\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common-sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the  judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that\nall security clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n\n6\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a driver for a defense contractor who accrued several tax liens\n(federal and state), a landlord\u2019s judgment, and a number of delinquent debts over a\n15-year period.  These obligations remain outstanding and are security significant.\nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP omissions of his tax liens, outstanding judgment, and all of his debts\nover 180 days delinquent in the past seven years and currently 90 days delinquent,\nraise security concerns, too, about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nApplicant\u2019s financial issues\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information and can place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to address\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines: DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant attributed most of his financial problems to the lack of trucking\nassignments and his heavy child support arrearage.  He provided few documented\nspecifics of the circumstances surrounding his accrued tax liens, landlord\u2019s judgment,\nand consumer debts listed in the SOR and covered in his OPM interview.  Without\nmore information about the circumstances surrounding his debts and his past efforts in\naddressing them, Applicant cannot be credited with any notable progress to date in\nregaining control of his finances.  Further, he provides no hard assurances of any\ncommitment to resolve his debts in the foreseeable future. \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s lack of any documented explanations of his tax liens,\nhis outstanding judgment, and his failure to identify any responsive corrective steps\nto address his debts, he may not take advantage of MC \u00b6 20(b) of the financial\nconsiderations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly.\u201d  Application of MC \u00b6 20(b) requires an applicant to\ndocument not only probative evidence of extenuating circumstances associated with\nhis delinquent debt accruals, but also his demonstrated responsible efforts in\naddressing his debts, both during and after the precipitating events have subsided.\nApplicant has provided no qualifying documentation to warrant the application of MC\n\u00b6 20(b).  Application of any part of MC \u00b6 20(b) is unjustified herein.\n\n7\nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant either under any of the other\nmitigating conditions, because he has not provided any documented evidence of\nrestorative steps he has taken to date.  Afforded an opportunity to supplement the\nFORM with documented contacts, payments, and work-out arrangements with some\nor all of his listed creditors, Applicant declined to do so.\n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, including trust and candor.  Financial stability in a person cleared to\naccess classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and confidence in\nthe holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s\ndemonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment\nand trust concerns are implicit in financial cases.\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his accumulation of still unresolved delinquent tax\nliens, judgment, and other debts.  To date, Applicant has not shown any tangible\nefforts to resolve his outstanding debts to overcome security concerns about the\nstate of his finances. \nConsidering the record as a whole, it is still too soon to make safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to resolve his tax liens, outstanding judgment,\nand old consumer debts, and restore his finances to stable levels commensurate\nwith his holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect\nto the allegations covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.o. \nApplicant\u2019s omission issues\nSecurity concerns over Appellant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness\nare raised under Guideline E as the result of his deliberate omission of his tax liens,\noutstanding judgment, and delinquent debts over 180 days delinquent in the past\nseven years and debts currently 90 days delinquent, respectively.  By his determined\nintentional omission of his liens, judgment and delinquent debts, Applicant failed to\nfurnish materially important background information about his finances that was\nneeded for the Government to properly process and evaluate his security clearance\napplication.\nApplicant\u2019s omissions are not accompanied by any explanations of the\ncircumstances surrounding completion of his e-QIP. Standing alone, without any\ncredible explanations, the omissions manifestly reflect his conscious decisions to\nomit material information concerning his tax liens, the outstanding judgment, and his\ndelinquent debts. Based on the inferences drawn of Applicant\u2019s intentional omissions\nof his tax liens, outstanding judgment, and debts over 180 days in the past seven\nyears and 90 days currently delinquent, respectively, the alleged omissions in the\nSOR are proven and concluded as stated. \n\n8\nTo his credit, Applicant voluntarily disclosed his liens, judgment and all of his\ndebts when asked about them in a subsequent official OPM interview.  The summary\ninterview provided by OPM documents that Applicant was contacted by an OPM\nagent two months after completing his e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s answers reflect some\ndegree of prompting or confronting by the interviewing OPM agent.\nApplicant\u2019s explanations of his debts, which followed specific questions asked\nof him by the OPM investigator, cannot, as such, be considered voluntary.  While\nApplicant\u2019s answers were sufficiently prompt to satisfy the prompt prong of MC \u00b6\n17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d they did not\nmeet the good-faith requirement. of MC \u00b6 17(a). \nIn evaluating all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-QIP\nomissions and his ensuing partial corrections, his disclosures are insufficient to\nenable him to convincingly mitigate the deliberate falsification allegations.\nQuestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations are core security concerns of the personal conduct guideline\n(AG \u00b615).  They are clearly evident under the facts and policy considerations\ndeveloped under this Guideline.  Overall, Applicant\u2019s omission corrections are\ninsufficient enough to warrant conclusions that his e-QIP omissions of his delinquent\ndebts are mitigated by prompt, voluntary corrections.\nTaking into account all of the evidence produced in this record, unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to the Guideline E allegations that Applicant\nknowingly and wilfully omitted his tax liens, the outstanding judgment against him,\nand his debts more than 180 days delinquent in the past seven years and currently\n90 days delinquent, respectively, in the e-QIP he completed.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in\nthe context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed\nabove, I make the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.o:\n     Against Applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\n     AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a through 2.c:\n     Against Applicant\n\n9\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  Clearance is denied. \n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn December 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 2, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 12, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 17, 2009, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on March 11, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 1, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nthrough 5. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant and one witness \ntestified. He offered Exhibits (AE) A through E. Department Counsel did not object and \nthey were admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 20, \n2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with explanations and they \nare incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and worked for a federal contractor from 1976 until \nNovember 2001, when he was laid off from work. He has held different levels of security \nclearances over his career and presently holds a top secret clearance.1 Applicant was \nmarried from 1976 to 1991. He remarried in 1999. He has one adult child and two adult \nstepchildren.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s employer downsized in November 2001 he lost his job and was \nunemployed until approximately December 2002. He and his wife were struggling to \nmake ends meet. He had some debts when he lost his job, but he incurred additional \ncredit card debts while he was juggling his finances during the 13 month period of \nunemployment.2 He contacted the credit card companies and explained to them he had \nlost his job and there were extenuating circumstances. He understood that they would \nfreeze the minimum payments required, along with their fees and lower the interest \nrates. His main focus was on finding another job, which he did. He was not focused on \nhis credit card debts.3 He admitted he was late on some of his other bills when he was \nunemployed, but once he got a job, he was not late. He believed he continued to make \nthe minimum payments on his credit card bills while he was unemployed. He resumed \nworking in December 2002.4  \n \n \nIn April 2005, Applicant\u2019s job moved to a different state. He was given the \nopportunity to relocate to the new site. His wife did not relocate and the two maintained \nseparate residences, which impacted their finances. When Applicant moved he \nreviewed his credit card debts and realized that the companies did not freeze his debts \nor the interest rates. He was unaware that if he was late paying one bill it impacted the \ninterest rate he paid on another. He researched his options to find the best way to \ndispute the excessive fees and interest. 5  \n \n \n1 Tr. 10, 24. \n \n2 GE 3, 4 and 5. \n \n3 AE B. \n \n4 Tr. 26-28, 77-80. \n \n5 Tr. 28-30. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn May and June 2005, Applicant learned of an education company that provided \ninformation on how credit card companies do business. He did not deny he owed the \ndifferent creditors money, but disputed their increased interest rates and escalating \npayments. The education company provided the legal documents necessary to pursue \nlegal action. It did not provide legal representation. In July 2005, based on what he \nlearned Applicant sent certified billing dispute letters to each of his creditors. Applicant \ndid not dispute that he owed each creditor, but did dispute the amount. He requested \nthey provide a detailed accounting of payments he had made and he disputed the debt \namounts.6 On the advice of the educational company he stopped making payments to \nthe credit card companies because they would not respond. This action was taken to \nforce the creditor to take legal action. He was advised it could take more than three \nyears to resolve. The premise for the legal action was to force the creditor to come up \nwith a fair amount for Applicant to repay. He explained that once he disputed the debt \nwith the creditor they are prohibited from imposing additional fees and interest. The \ncreditors continued to impose additional fees and interest. Applicant stated that the \ncredit card companies do not expect people to fight them.7  \n \n \nAfter July 2005, only one credit card company responded (SOR 1.e, $18,000). \nApplicant challenged the legitimacy of the credit card company\u2019s additional charges. \nThe creditor filed a lawsuit and Applicant pursued his legal rights, acting pro se \nthroughout the proceedings. Applicant provided copies of his responses to motions and \nfilings.8 It is clear that the creditor through their attorney was attempting to intimidate \nApplicant. Applicant was not intimated and eventually the creditor agreed to settle the \ncase for a reasonable amount based on Applicant\u2019s original debt with reasonable \ninterest. The debt was finally settled in February 2009 for $9,000. Applicant set up a \npayment plan with an automatic bank transfer, so he would not be late with his \npayments. He intended to use the lessons he learned from resolving this debt to resolve \nthe others. He asked the attorney why it took so long to settle and he was told that the \nstate where they were wants the parties to settle so much that they do not make an \neffort to set the case, until one of the two parties formally requests the case be \ndocketed. When his security clearance became an issue Applicant realized he needed \nto immediately change his plan to expedite resolving the remaining debts. Although he \nbelieved in the validity of how he was addressing his debts, he was aware it would take \nway too long to continue his plan and would jeopardize his security clearance.9  \n \nApplicant contacted a \u201cdebt solution\u201d company. He researched their legitimacy \nthrough the Better Business Bureau and set up a payment plan to resolve the remaining \nfour debts on the SOR. He learned that the state where he lives allows debts to \u201cstay \naround forever.\u201d Applicant set up a debt repayment/savings plan to pay the rest of his \n \n6 AE C. \n \n7 Tr. 30-34, 60-62. \n \n8 Tr.

As \nthe fee is paid down, more of the payments go toward paying off the delinquent debts. \nApplicant also takes whatever extra expendable income he has and puts it in the \nsavings plan. The amount going toward his debts will increase once he completes \npaying the fees he owes the debt solution company. When he has accumulated enough \nmoney in the savings plan, the company will then negotiate reasonable settlements. \nBased on his plan he projects he will pay off all of his delinquent debts by January 2013. \nApplicant provided documentary evidence that he has started the plan and is making \npayments into the plan and the payment schedule. He intends to accelerate his \npayments to pay off the debts before the proposed date.10 \n \n \nApplicant has a very detailed budget that reflects his repayment/savings plan. He \nand wife began an intense financial education workshop through their church. Applicant \nexplained the reason he expects to repay his debt early is because of the lessons he is \nlearning through the financial course. Although they do not live in the same location, \nApplicant and his wife both participate in the workshop. He has compact disks with \nlesson plans that he listens to. The complete program is 13 weeks and at the time of \nhearing they completed seven weeks. He and his wife discuss their finances daily and \nplan each month\u2019s budget in detail. He believes their budgeting has improved and they \nare saving more money. They have an emergency fund and a fund to repay their \ndelinquent debts. They are paying their monthly expenses on time. They do not use \ncredit cards. He and his wife have a good grip on their finances now and are changing \ntheir ways. They have not accumulated any new debts.11  \n \n \nApplicant provided documents showing his career highlights. He is consistently \nan outstanding employee.12 Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor testified on his behalf. He \nevaluated his performance and he is always at or above what is expected of him and he \nis committed to the company\u2019s core values of family, integrity, loyalty and passion. He is \nrespectful to coworkers, management and others. He is considered an expert in the \narea where he works and has a unique capability that others do not possess. His \ninstitutional knowledge is difficult to replace. He is committed to the war fighter and \nApplicant goes above and beyond what is expected to ensure he provides the proper \nservice. He is considered honest and trustworthy and is highly recommended for a \nsecurity clearance.13  \n \n \n \n \n10 Tr. 41-42, 63-64-68; AE C. Applicant pays $403 a month into the debt savings plan for five \nmonths that goes toward the company\u2019s fees. In the sixth month, $103 goes toward the fees and the \nremainder goes towards his debts. After eight to twelve months the entire amount goes toward the \nbalance of the debts.  \n \n11 Tr. 43-44; 48-59, 68-77; AE E. \n \n12 Tr. 44-45; AE D. \n \n13 Tr. 82-94. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has five credit card debts totaling more than $47,765.14 He had \ndifficulty paying these debts on time from 2001 to 2002, while he was unemployed. I find \nboth disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n \n14 This amount is based on the settlement agreement amount for the debt in SOR 1.e. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant was employed for many years and paid his bills on time. He lost his job \nin 2001 and thought because he was out of a job the interest and penalties on his debts \nwould be frozen. Although this position may be somewhat naive, I found him credible in \nbeing unaware of the exorbitant rates that were being charged. Applicant is currently \naddressing his delinquent debts through a settlement payment and a payment plan. \nHowever at this juncture, his debts are still current and not infrequent. The reason the \ndebts escalated were because Applicant lost his job and was unemployed for 13 \nmonths. I find that his actions occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nEven if Applicant were to again find himself unemployed, he is actively learning how to \nmanage his finances and protect his financial future. I also find that his past actions do \nnot cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Therefore, I find (a) \npartially applies. \n \n \nApplicant did not dispute he owed the creditors, nor did he dispute that they had \na right to charge him interest. He was unaware that a late payment on one debt \nescalated an interest charge on another. He decided to fight back and took the advice of \na financial education company and disputed what he viewed as an unfair practice. He \ndid so in writing and received only one creditor\u2019s response. It took a long time to resolve \nthat debt, but he has since agreed with the creditor to a settlement offer and has started \nto repay the debt. Because his security clearance was an issue, he could not wait to \nresolve the other debts in the same way. Instead he set up a payment plan to repay all \nof the remaining debts. I find Applicant\u2019s unemployment was a condition beyond his \ncontrol. He also accepted the advice of the financial education company that advised \nhim to stop paying the remaining debts and dispute them in writing. It is clear it was \nalways Applicant\u2019s intent to repay his debts. I find (b) applies because Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances by forcing the creditors to justify their fees.  \n \n \nApplicant has a very detailed budget that he and his wife adhere to. He started to \ndispute his debts in 2005. He should have started earlier. He did dispute the excess \ninterest on his debts. He and his wife are taking a 13 week financial course to learn how \nto manage their money. They are saving their expendable income and putting it in \naccounts that are set aside to negotiate settlements on their debts. I find under the \ncircumstances there are clear indications the problems are being resolved and \nApplicant is making a good faith effort to resolve his debts. I find mitigating conditions \n(c) and (d) apply. I also find that Applicant had a reasonable dispute on certain fees that \nwere charged by the creditor. His disputes were addressed in writing and he resolved \none of his debts through a settlement, which he is paying. The other creditors did not \nrespond. Applicant has a right to dispute those things he does not believe are fair. It is \n\n \n8 \n \n \nclear by the one debt he settled that the goal of the creditor was to wear him down and \nmake it difficult for him. I find under the circumstances mitigating condition (e) also \napplies.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant responsibly paid his bills \non time for years while he was employed. During a period of unemployment he \naccumulated delinquent debts. He disputed the tactics used by the credit card \ncompanies to extract exorbitant fees from creditors. It was a long and laborious process, \nbut he was able to resolve one of his debts for a reasonable settlement. However, due \nto the potential impact the process was having on his security clearance, Applicant set \nup a payment plan to resolve the remaining debts. He has a detailed budget and is \nsaving money with a debt solution company to negotiate settlements on the remaining \ndebts. Overall, the record evidence does not leave me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 14, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.\nForeman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Specifically, Applicant contends that\n\nthe Judge should have found the government\u2019s security concerns to be mitigated.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years of age.\nApplicant married for the first time in 1998, at which time his wife was working.  Between 1999 and\n2005, Applicant and his wife leased or purchased several expensive motor vehicles, accumulating\nsignificant debt to do so.  Applicant\u2019s wife ceased working in 2003, and they divorced in 2006.\nWhile Applicant\u2019s wife worked, she paid the utilities and one car note.  After she stopped working,\nApplicant was responsible for all their debts.  Beginning in 2000, Applicant and his wife received\ncounseling from an elder in their church.  The elder advised Applicant to work toward being debt-\nfree.  In 2004, Applicant hired an attorney for assistance with one debt.  At the time of their divorce,\nApplicant and his wife surrendered four motor vehicles to their creditors, with each to be responsible\nfor the deficiencies on two vehicles.  After his divorce, Applicant refinanced his home in order to\ncarry out his property settlement with his wife.  Applicant used some of the equity in the home to\npay off one large automobile debt.  The mortgage Applicant obtained at that time was an adjustable-\nrate mortgage.  In October 2007, Applicant\u2019s mortgage payment increased from $2,400 to $3,200\nper month, and Applicant was unable to make the increased payments.  In September 2007,\nApplicant contacted a credit and financial counseling service about his financial situation.  Following\ntheir advice, Applicant surrendered two vehicles to the lien holders, incurring deficiency debts of\napproximately $31,000 and $46,000.  Among the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant satisfied a\njudgment on a credit card debt of $410 in January 2009.  In July 2009, Applicant achieved\nmodification of the first and second mortgages on his home.  In August 2009, the month when the\nhearing was held, Applicant paid two small delinquent telephone bills and established payment plans\nto repay in the future a credit card debt and the two large automobile deficiencies noted above, as\nwell as another automobile deficiency of over $41,000.  In mitigation of his financial situation,\nApplicant presented evidence regarding the deaths of his parents and his own health problems, but\nApplicant did not demonstrate that those matters affected his finances.  Applicant has obtained a\npart-time job as a musician at his church, and his pastor considers him a person of integrity and\nexemplary moral character. \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).\n Applicant contends that the Judge did not give sufficient weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether\nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement\nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10079 at 2\n(App. Bd. Dec. 10, 2009).  In this case, the Judge discussed in detail the mitigating evidence that\nApplicant presented and explained why it was not sufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\n\nconcerns.

He \nbegan accumulating debt shortly after his marriage, due in part to his interest in \nexpensive motor vehicles. He and his wife leased a Nissan Murano SUV in 1999 (GX 4 \nat 4). They purchased a new BMW and an Audi in April 2000. In 2001, they traded in \nthe BMW for a Porsche (Tr. 151-52). In September 2001, he borrowed about $16,500 to \npurchase a motorcycle. In May 2002, he traded the first motorcycle for a more \nexpensive Ducati motorcycle and borrowed about $23,500 (GX 4 at 12; Tr. 159-60). He \nborrowed about $46,000 to purchase a used BMW in April 2005. He purchased a \nsecond Porsche in December 2005 and a Land Rover in July 2005 (Tr. 135-36). \n \nApplicant and his wife separated in 2001, reconciled, and separated again in \n2003. His wife was employed from 2001 to 2003 and she paid the utilities and one of \nthe car notes (Tr. 79). After they were separated, his wife stopped working, and \nApplicant was responsible for all the marital debts (Tr. 77).  \n \n \nAn elder in Applicant\u2019s church began counseling him and his first wife in 2000. \nThe counseling included financial advice, because Applicant and his wife were \naccumulating considerable debt. He strongly advised Applicant to work toward being \ndebt free (Tr. 51-55). \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant consulted an attorney for assistance, because he had \nnegotiated a payment arrangement for the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, to be \npaid by automatic withdrawals from his bank account, but the withdrawals suddenly \nstopped without explanation (Tr. 87-88). His attorney sent a letter to the collection \nagency handling the delinquent debt after Applicant tried to contact the agency and \nfound the number had been disconnected. He heard nothing further from the creditor or \nthe collection agency (Tr. 87-90; AX I).  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife were divorced in February 2006 (AX G). At the time he \nwas earning about $93,000 per year (AX C). As part of the property settlement, \nApplicant and his former wife agreed that the Audi, Nissan Murano, the Ducati \nmotorcycle, and the Porsche, all titled in both names, would be surrendered to the \ncreditors. They agreed that the wife would be solely responsible for any deficiency on \nthe Audi and the Nissan, and Applicant would be solely responsible for any deficiency \non the Ducati motorcycle and the Porsche. Applicant also agreed to refinance the \nmarital home and to pay his ex-wife 40% of the equity in the home. They also agreed \nwhich party would assume full responsibility for several loans and credit card accounts. \nApplicant is not required to pay any support to his ex-wife and is not entitled to any \nsupport from her. \n \nAfter his divorce, Applicant refinanced his house and obtained an adjustable-rate \nmortgage (Tr. 82-84). He used some of the equity in his house to pay off the loan on the \nBMW, which he sold after about a year (Tr. 151). In October 2007, his mortgage rate \nadjusted upward, increasing his monthly payments from $2,400 to $3,200 (Tr. 85). He \nwas unable to make the increased payments. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in April 2003. He helped his disabled father \nmanage his affairs until he passed away in 2007. Except for incidental transportation \ncosts, He did not incur any expenses in taking care of his father (Tr. 102-06). Applicant \nsuffers from gastro-intestinal problems, and they flared up in 2006, around the time of \nhis divorce. He was concerned because his mother had similar medical problems before \nher death (Tr. 107). He has received medical treatment and has not been impeded in \nhis ability to continue working (Tr. 110). Although Applicant presented evidence of the \ndeaths of his parents and his medical condition as matters in mitigation, there is no \nevidence that they contributed significantly to his financial problems.  \n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant contacted a credit and financial counseling service \nfor assistance (Tr. 96; AX T). Among other things, the counseling service recommended \nthat he dispose of the Land Rover and the Porsche and try to negotiate a payment plan \nto resolve the remaining debts related to them (Tr. 94). He surrendered the Land Rover \nto the lien-holder in December 2007 and he surrendered the Porsche in 2008 (Tr. 94). \nThe deficiency after the sale of the Land Rover was about $31,000 (Tr. 136). The \ndeficiency on the Porsche was about $46,000 (GX 4 at 6).  \n \n \nAfter surrendering the Porsche to the lien-holder in 2008, Applicant purchased a \n1995 Acura and financed it with the seller. He disposed of this vehicle, apparently \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwithout incurring any additional debt. In February 2009, before receiving the SOR, \nApplicant purchased a 1995 Land Rover for $2,500 (Tr. 144) and a 1989 Jaguar for \nabout $4,000, paying cash for both vehicles (Tr. 146). He testified he needs two cars \nbecause he is a drummer and needs a large vehicle to transport his instruments (Tr. \n146).  \n \nApplicant remarried in October 2007, but he and his second wife separated in \nNovember 2007 and were divorced in 2009 (GX 5 at 25; Tr. 110). He has no children \nfrom either of his marriages (Tr. 186). He is not responsible for supporting anyone but \nhimself.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $106,000 (AX C). His net monthly income per \ntwo-week pay period is $2,799 (AX B). He has no savings, no investments, and no \nretirement accounts (Tr. 179, 189). He has filed all his state and federal income tax \nreturns on time. His federal return for 2006 was audited and he owes about $4,000 for \nthat year (Tr. 185). \n \nApplicant was interviewed about his delinquent debts in April and May 2008, and \nhe received financial interrogatories from DOHA in late March 2009 (GX 5 at 21-28). He \npaid the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in January 2009 (AX K).  \n \nOn March 3, 2009, Applicant signed a contract with a consulting service to assist \nhim in modifying his home mortgage (AX S; Tr. 100-102). He was successful, and the \nlender modified the loan to a lower rate in July 2009 (Tr. 101).  \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant negotiated a settlement of the credit card debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b and agreed to pay it in installments beginning on August 30, 2009. If he \ncomplies with the payment schedule, the debt will be satisfied in January 2010 (AX L; \nTr. 118-20). \n \nAlso in August 2009, Applicant negotiated a payment plan for the delinquent auto \nloan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. The agreement provides for monthly payments of $875 \nbeginning in September 2009, with the last payment scheduled for August 2012 (AX Q; \nTr. 120-21). At about the same time, Applicant negotiated a settlement of the delinquent \nauto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h and agreed to make monthly payments of $1,000 in \nSeptember and October 2009, $350 in November and December 2009, and $175 per \nmonth until the debt is satisfied (AX R; Tr. 122-25). \n \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant had reached an agreement to resolve the \ndelinquent auto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, along with several other debts to the same \ncreditor, but he had not received written confirmation of the agreement. A week after the \nhearing, he received confirmation of an agreement (AX W), and he mailed three post-\ndated checks: one for $100 and post-dated September 4, 2009; one for $100 and post-\ndated October 2, 2009; and one for $1,200 and post-dated November 6, 2009 (AX X).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant has adopted a budget that will enable him to carry out his obligations \nunder his modified mortgage and negotiated payment agreements, but it leaves a \nmonthly remainder of only about $42 (AX V). To generate additional income, Applicant \nhas rented his house for $700 per month (AX D). He also has been hired as a musician \nby his church and will be paid $500 per month (AX E). His pastor has known him for \nabout five years and considers him a person of integrity and exemplary moral character \n(AX U). \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR.  \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus/Date \nEvidence \n1.a \nCredit card \n(judgment) \n$410 \nSatisfied, Jan 09 \nAX K; Tr. 114-15 \n1.b \nCredit card \n$3,286 \nPayment plan, Aug 09 \nAX L; Tr. 118-20 \n1.c \nTelephone \n$132 \nPaid, Aug 09 \nAX J; Tr. 112-13 \n1.d \nTelephone \n$63 \nPaid, Aug 09 \nAX J; Tr. 112-13 \n1.e \nPast due 2nd \nmortgage payments \n$3,669 \nLoan modified, Jul 09 \nAX M, N, O; Tr. 115 \n1.f \nPast due 1st \nmortgage payments \n$30,560 \nLoan modified, Jul 09 \nAX M,N; O Tr. 115 \n1.g \nAuto loan \n$31,517 \nPayment plan, Aug 09 \nAX Q; Tr. 120-21 \n1.h \nAuto loan \n$47,540 \nPayment plan, Aug 09 \nAX R; Tr. 122-25 \n1.i \nAuto loan \n$41,652 \nPayment plan, Aug 09 \nAX W, X; Tr. 125-26 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n6 \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged \ncondition that is raised by \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending \nand the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which \nmay be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). The first prong of AG \n\u00b6 19(b) (\u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending\u201d) is raised, but the second prong is not, \nbecause Applicant has established a realistic plan to pay his debts.  \n  \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were numerous, \nrecent, did not occur under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and they cast doubt \non his reliability and good judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant has been divorced twice, suffered \nsome serious medical problems, and lost both of his parents. This mitigating condition is \nnot established, however, he did not adjust his lifestyle to his income and did not take \ntimely, reasonable actions to pay his creditors. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not fully established, because the payment plans for most of his \ndebts have not been in effect long enough to establish a solid track record of financial \nresponsibility. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish \n\n \n8 \n \n \nresolution of each and every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 \nat 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make \npayments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the \ndebts alleged in the SOR be paid first. Id.  \n \n \nGood faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL \n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Payment of debts because of the pressure of \nqualifying for a security clearance does not constitute good faith.  \n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant initiated a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i and \nhe consulted with an attorney after his payments by automatic withdrawal were stopped. \nHe took no further action, however, after his attorney wrote one letter and apparently \nreceived no response. He paid the $410 judgment for a delinquent credit card account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) in January 2009. About three weeks before he received the SOR, he \nsigned the contract with the company that successfully renegotiated his home \nmortgages. Even though he was questioned twice about his delinquent debts by a \nsecurity investigator in April and May 2008, he did not address his remaining debts until \nAugust 2009, within two weeks of the hearing. The evidence indicates Applicant\u2019s \nrecent actions were not motivated by a sense of obligation to his creditors, but rather by \na desire to save his home from foreclosure and retain his clearance. Although Applicant \nhas initiated a plan to resolve all his debts, I conclude AG \u00b6 29(d) is not fully \nestablished, because Applicant has not carried his burden of establishing the element of \ngood faith.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). This \nmitigating condition is not established, because Applicant has not disputed any of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n9 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant presented himself at the hearing as articulate and intelligent. He \nacknowledged his bad judgment. He has resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and \n1.d. He presented a realistic plan to resolve his remaining delinquent debts. His plan, \nhowever, was not fully developed until just before the hearing, leaving no time for him to \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. Given his long record of living beyond \nhis means and exercising bad financial judgment, more time is needed to evaluate \nwhether he can demonstrate responsible conduct and carry out his plan. See Directive \n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37 through E3.1.41 (reconsideration authorized after one year). \n \n \nIn her closing statement, Applicant\u2019s counsel suggested the possibility of a \nconditional clearance (Tr. 202). The Appeal Board has made it clear that administrative \njudges do not have authority to grant conditional clearances. See ISCR Case No. 99-\n0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000); see also ISCR Case No. 01-\n24318 at 3, 2003 WL 21979745 at *2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2003). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 Applicant\u2019s SOR response admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.n (GE 8). He said the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.n duplicated each other (GE 8). He denied the remainder of his SOR debts (GE 8). Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). In 1985, he graduated from high school, and in 2003, he earned a bachelors of science degree in information systems (Tr. 7). He is married (Tr. 104, 118-120; GE 1). His security clearance application does not list any other reportable incidents involving illegal drugs, alcohol, the police, or courts (GE 1).

SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($852) and 1.b ($360)\u2014PAID. On March 13, 2009, Applicant paid the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($852) (Tr. 33, 85; AE F). The government stipulated that the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($360) was paid (Tr. 33-3",

His $8,776 federal tax debt is in an established payment plan. Department \nCounsel withdrew three SOR debts totaling $15,647. Over the last four years, he paid \nten SOR debts and numerous other debts. However, two debts totaling $67,247 are not \nadequately addressed or resolved. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated, \nand eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 28, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations \nProcessing \n(e-QIP) \nor \nsecurity \nclearance \napplication \n(SF-86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On February 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued an SOR (GE 7) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, \nas amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as \namended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) \n(GE 7). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 24, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (GE 8). He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On September 1, 2009, Department Counsel \nindicated she was ready to proceed on his case. On September 9, 2009, DOHA \nassigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On October 9, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice \n(GE 6). On November 10, 2009, Applicant\u2019s hearing was held. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Tr. 20), and Applicant offered 13 \nexhibits (Tr. 25-28, 33, 39-41; AE A-M). Some of the pages were missing from AE A, \nApplicant\u2019s credit report (Tr. 27-28). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 \n(Tr. 20, 29), and AE A-M (Tr. 28-29, 42). Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, \nSOR, and response to the SOR (GE 6-8). On November 17, 2009, I received the \ntranscript. Initially, I held the record open until December 1, 2009, to permit Applicant to \nprovide additional documentation (Tr. 49, 118). I granted more time to Applicant to \nsubmit documentation, and then closed the record on December 20, 2009. After his \nhearing, Applicant provided nine exhibits (AE N-V), which were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l, \nand 1.n (GE 8). He said the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.n duplicated each other (GE 8). \nHe denied the remainder of his SOR debts (GE 8).  \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 7). In 1985, he \ngraduated from high school, and in 2003, he earned a bachelors of science degree in \ninformation systems (Tr. 7). He is married (Tr. 104, 118-120; GE 1). His security \nclearance application does not list any other reportable incidents involving illegal drugs, \nalcohol, the police, or courts (GE 1).    \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nThe SOR listed 16 delinquent debts, totaling $103,387 as follows: \u00b6 1.a ($852\u2014\nmedical); \u00b6 1.b ($360\u2014medical); \u00b6 1.c ($2,417\u2014federal tax lien); \u00b6 1.d ($8,776\u2014federal \ntax lien); \u00b6 1.e ($65,000\u2014student loan); \u00b6 1.f ($164\u2014credit card); \u00b6 1.g ($2,247\u2014credit \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

On March 13, 2009, Applicant paid \nthe medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($852) (Tr. 33, 85; AE F). The government stipulated that \nthe medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($360) was paid (Tr. 33-34, 85).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,417)\u2014PAID and 1.d ($8,776)\u2014PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant had \ntwo unpaid federal tax liens as indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,417) and 1.d ($8,776) (Tr. \n34-43). He paid, and the government released the tax lien in SOR \u00b6 1.c in April of 2009 \n(Tr. 38-39, 45, 85; GE 3; AE A; AE G). An October 14, 2009, Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) statement shows liabilities for tax years 2003 ($322), 2006 ($13,295), and 2007 \n($3,254) (AE H). Applicant has a payment plan with the IRS with a monthly payment of \n$300 (Tr. 35, 43-44; AE H). At the time of his hearing he had made one $323 payment \nand one $300 payment in September and October 2009, resolving his delinquent tax \ndebt for 2003 (Tr. 44; AE B). The federal tax debts resulted from the IRS auditing his tax \nreturns and making changes to the information he submitted on his tax returns (Tr. 46). \nThe IRS charged penalties because Applicant took money out of a retirement account \n(Tr. 47). Applicant provided proof that he made a post-hearing payment to the IRS in \nNovember 2009 (Tr. 49-50, 85; AE P, AE Q). Applicant and his spouse file their taxes \nseparately (Tr. 110). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($65,000)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant borrowed money to assist him \nin the completion of his bachelors degree in 2000 (Tr. 50, 88; GE 2; GE 3; AE A). He \nmade some payments in 2002 to 2003 (Tr. 88). When he completed his February 28, \n2008, security clearance application, he noted he owed $51,059 in student loan debt. \nHe stated the date incurred was November 2005 (estimated). He also indicated, \n\u201cpayment arrangements have been made with [creditor] to \u2018catch up\u2019 on the payments\u201d \n(GE 1 at 37). He concluded the financial section of his security clearance application \nstating, \u201cI have made payment arrangements on ALL debts on my financial record and \nhave reached settlement amounts to help pay-off debts\u201d (GE 1 at 41). On December 30, \n2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories and provided documentation \nresolving numerous debts. His student loans were listed as item 5 totaling $63,666 (GE \n5 at 7). His response to DOHA interrogatories did not address resolution of his student \nloan debt (GE 5). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant noted that his student loans were sold to collection \ncompanies and he lost track of this debt (Tr. 51, 87-88). He called the creditor listed in \nhis credit report, and the creditor notified him of the new creditor holding his student \nloan debt (Tr. 53). He contacted the new holder of his student loan debt and leaned the \nloans were transferred (Tr. 54). He said he was \u201ctrying to figure out who currently owns \nthis account\u201d (Tr. 54). He also said he thought he wrote the creditors letters to establish \na paper trail (Tr. 54). He said he would try to obtain information showing he made \npayments in 2002 to 2003, and his attempts to locate the creditor holding his account \n(Tr. 54, 85-89). 90-91). He said he would try to find the documentation showing \npayment arrangements were made with the creditor, as indicated in his 2008 security \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nclearance application (Tr. 121). He did not provide any post-hearing documentation \nshowing attempts to resolve his student loans. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($164)\u2014PAID. Applicant settled the credit card account for $425 and \npaid this debt (Tr. 54-55, 92; GE 2; GE 3; AE A at 9; AE I).  \n    \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($2,247)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant was unable to locate the \ncreditor because he believed the creditor listed in his credit report and SOR transferred \nthe debt as indicated in his October 15, 2009, credit report (Tr. 57-59; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 \nat 2; GE 4 at 11; AE A at 4). He did not have any documentation showing he contacted \nthe creditor (Tr. 58). I explained how Applicant could determine whether the account \nwas resolved, and gave him time after the hearing to provide documentation (Tr. 64-66, \n92). He did not provide any post-hearing evidence concerning this account. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($704)\u2014PAID. The government conceded this debt was paid (Tr. 67; \nGE 3). Applicant said the debt was generated when he underpaid his 2005 state taxes \n(Tr. 67, 92).   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($2,927) and 1.n ($2,029)\u2014PAID. An April 7, 2009, letter from the \ncreditor listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.n indicated the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n was settled for \n$248 and paid (Tr. 69-70; AE J). The account numbers match on his April 12, 2008, \ncredit bureau report and on the letter from the collection company showing the account \nin SOR \u00b6 1.n is paid (GE 4 at 7; AE J). One of the credit bureau reports for the same \ncollection company lists two amounts, $2,029 and $2,927 (GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2), and \nApplicant\u2019s contention that they are the same account is reasonable (Tr. 72-75, 82, 92; \nAE A at 3; AE M).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($904)\u2014PAID. This credit card debt was paid (Tr. 75-76, 92; AE A at \n3, 6). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k ($2,170), 1.l ($13,115), and 1.p ($362)\u2014WITHDRAWN. Department \nCounsel moved for withdrawal of these three allegations, and I approved her requests \n(Tr. 79, 81, 84, 92-93). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($708)\u2014PAID. On January 26, 2009, the creditor indicated this debt \nwas settled in full (Tr. 81-82, 92; AE K). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($652)\u2014PAID. On December 26, 2008, the creditor indicated the debt \nwas settled for $500 and paid (Tr. 83, 92; AE L). \n \nThe only expensive item Applicant has purchased in the last two years was a \nHyundai (Tr. 97). Appellant\u2019s vehicle loan for the purchase of the Hyundai shows a \nbalance of $13,296, and the status is \u201cpays as agreed\u201d (Tr. 96-97; AE A at 11). \nApplicant\u2019s home is in his wife\u2019s name, and not Applicant\u2019s name (Tr. 97). A mortgage \naccount does not appear on his credit report. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement (PFS) shows a gross monthly salary of \n$8,350, a net monthly salary of $5,506, monthly expenses of $2,950, monthly debt \npayments of $568, and a net monthly remainder of $1,988 (Tr. 98-112; GE 5 at 12). His \nspouse makes about an additional $4,000 per month (Tr. 99). He and his spouse have \nseparate bank accounts and divide household expenses (Tr. 111). He listed debt \npayments to Hyundai, and three small debts, totaling $860 on his PFS (GE 5 at 12).  \n  \nApplicant said his delinquent debts were generated through overspending (Tr. \n93-94). When he opened an account, his intent was to keep his account in good \nstanding (Tr. 94); however, when an unexpected expense would occur, such as a \nmedical bill or a car repair, his payments would fall behind (Tr. 94). He conceded that \nspending on vacations and cruises in 2000 and 2007 may have adversely affected his \nfinancial situation (Tr. 95). He also attributed his financial problems to going from one \njob to another when his contracts ended; however, he did not describe the length of any \nperiods of unemployment or provide details about how it affected his income (AE O). \nHis February 28, 2008, security clearance application did not list any periods of \nunemployment after January 1996 (GE 1). He has changed his lifestyle and reduced his \nexpenses (AE O). \n \nApplicant provided letters to SOR creditors dated December 2, 5, 9, 10, 20, \n2008, offering to settle accounts or initiate payment plans (GE 5 at 40-44). None of \nthese letters related to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g.  \n \nApplicant emphasized that he began paying his delinquent debts before he \nreceived the SOR (Tr. 113). His goal was to become debt free, except for his car loan \nand a few small household debts (Tr. 113). He has a budget and uses it to manage his \nmoney (Tr. 114-115). He planned to pay his IRS debt and student loans (Tr. 114). I \nrecommended Applicant provide proof of financial counseling (Tr. 122). He had a \nmeeting with a financial planner scheduled for December 16, 2009 (AE O, P).  \n \nResolution of Non-SOR debts \n \nOn October 4, 2005, Applicant settled a lawsuit on a civil case (GE 5 at 15). On \nNovember 23, 2005, Applicant paid $170 and $253 resolving two credit card debts (GE \n5 at 20, 21).  \n \nOn January 15, 2007, Applicant settled and paid $458, resolving a collection \naccount (GE 5 at 36). On February 22, 2007, he satisfied a collection account (GE 5 at \n35). On March 9, 2007, he settled and paid $644, resolving a collection account (GE 5 \nat 37). On March 22, 2007, he settled and paid a collection account (GE 5 at 33). On \nApril 17, 2007, he settled and paid a collection company $289, resolving a debt (GE 5 at \n34). On September 20, 2007, he settled a credit card account (GE 5 at 38). On October \n5, 2007, he paid a collection account (GE 5 at 32). On December 26, 2007, he settled a \ncredit card account (GE 5 at 31). \n \nOn March 25, 2008, he paid a medical debt (GE 5 at 17, 18). On April 16, 2008, \nhe settled and paid a collection account (GE 5 at 14). On August 15, 2008, he paid a \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nmedical debt (GE 5 at 29). On August 15, 2008, he paid $425 to settle a department \nstore account (GE 5 at 30). On August 29, 2008, he settled and paid a credit card \naccount (GE 5 at 16). Letters dated September 9 and 23, 2008, from a bank and law \nfirm indicate the account was settled in full (GE 5 at 27, 28). An October 1, 2008, letter \nfrom a computer company and a September 19, 2008, letter from the computer \ncompany\u2019s collection agent indicate their accounts show \u201cpaid collection\u201d (GE 5 at 25, \n26). On October 31, 2008, he settled and paid a credit card account (GE 5 at 19). On \nNovember 18, 2008, he settled and paid $310 resolving a telecommunications debt (GE \n5 at 22). On November 26, 2008, he received a letter from a bank creditor indicating the \naccount is closed (GE 5 at 23). On November 26, 2008, he paid a collection company \n$935, resolving a school related debt (GE 5 at 24). On December 2, 2008, he settled \nand paid a telecommunications account (GE 5 at 13).  \n \nOn January 27, 2009, Applicant paid a medical debt (AE F). On September 23, \n2009, he paid $153, resolving an overdraft debt to a bank (AE E). On November 9, \n2009, he paid $331 resolving a telecommunications account (AE D; AE N; AE R; AE S). \nOn November 9, 2009, he resolved a medical debt (AE C). \n \nCharacter references \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s supervisors has known him for more than eight years and \ndescribed him as highly qualified and highly motivated (AE T). He is dependable, \nhonest, respectful, and responsible (AE T). He recommends that Applicant receive a \nsecurity clearance (AE T).  \n   \nApplicant\u2019s minister has known him since 2004 (AE U). Applicant became a \nlicensed minister in 2007 (AE U). Applicant is respectful, humble, professional, \ncompassionate, and trustworthy (AE U). Applicant is pursuing his Masters of Divinity \ndegree (AE U). He recommends that Applicant receive a security clearance (AE U).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s colleague has known him for 25 years, and in 1996, he worked with \nApplicant (AE V). He describes Applicant as knowledgeable, helpful, professional, \ndiligent, honest, respectful, and responsible (AE V). He recommends that Applicant \nreceive a security clearance (AE V).  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations). \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The Appeal Board has noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ncredit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is \ndocumented in his credit reports, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were \npaid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve two of his delinquent debts. \nHis delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He did not resolve all of his delinquent \nSOR debts through payment, established payment plans, or disputes. He did not take \nmeaningful steps to address his delinquent student loans, which total approximately \n$65,000.   \n \n AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) do not fully apply. Applicant said he had reductions in \nhis income when contracts ended; however, he did not provide specific enough \ninformation about reductions in income sufficient to cause the delinquent SOR and non-\nSOR debts over the last three years. There is insufficient information to show Applicant \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has a sophisticated understanding of credit reports, budgeting, settling \ndebts, and financial planning. He receives credit for financial counseling, even though \nhe did not provide proof that he received any financial counseling because I am not \nconvinced he would gain any knowledge from financial counseling.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his February 28, 2008, security clearance application, \nhe disclosed his $51,059 student loan debt. He stated the date this debt was incurred \nwas November 2005 (estimated), and he indicated, \u201cpayment arrangements have been \nmade with [creditor] to \u2018catch up\u2019 on the payments.\u201d At his hearing, he admitted this was \nmisleading if not outright false. He said he made some payments on his student loans in \n2002 and 2003. He admitted he did not have any payment arrangements with his \nstudent loan creditors. At his hearing, I asked him to provide proof of the payments he \nsaid he made back in 2002 to 2003 on his student loans; however, he did not provide \nproof of any payments on his student loans. I also asked him to provide copies of \ncorrespondence with his student loan creditors.2 He did not provide proof of any letters \nsent or received from his student loan creditors. Under the circumstances, there are no \nclear indications that his student loan debts are being resolved or are under control. \n \nApplicant does not receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) or 20(e). He did not \nact in good-faith3 in the resolution of his SOR debts because he did not adequately \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \ndemonstrate his efforts to pay or otherwise resolve his student loan debts. He did not \nshow sufficient adherence to his obligations.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. He provided proof of payment or resolution of \nnumerous debts. The SOR did not list any debts that were resolved through disputes. \nHe received credit for resolution of 14 of 16 SOR debts through payment, withdrawal, or \nestablished payment plan.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve two substantial delinquent debts. His delinquent student loan debts of \napproximately $65,000 were not connected to any unforeseen problems, such as \ndivorce or unemployment. He did not show or document any effort to arrange payment \nplans on his student loans, despite having ample income to address these delinquent \ndebts.     \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n  \n The whole person factors supporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they are insufficient to warrant approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance at this time. Applicant is 41 years old. He has achieved some important \neducational and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and \ndedication. Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands how to budget and \nwhat he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. Clearly, he \ncould have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and a colleague noted Applicant\u2019s excellent work \nperformance. He is diligent, hard working, and dedicated. He provided a large number \nof letters showing debt resolution from 2005 to 2009. His financial situation was \nadversely affected by the end of various contracts of employment, and some of his \ndebts were medically related. Applicant is active in his church and has continued his \neducation. His SOR listed 16 delinquent debts, totaling $103,387. His $8,776 federal tax \ndebt is in an established payment plan. Department Counsel withdrew three SOR debts \ntotaling $15,647. The government is well aware of his financial problems, and his \nfinancial problems do not render him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress.    \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant had numerous delinquent debts over the last four years, including \nseveral years where he failed to fully pay his federal income taxes. From 2005 to 2009, \nhe had ample income and systematically paid numerous delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s \nFebruary 28, 2008, security clearance application, said his $51,059 student loan debt \nwas incurred in November 2005 (estimated), and he claimed, \u201cpayment arrangements \nhave been made with [creditor] to \u2018catch up\u2019 on the payments.\u201d At his hearing, he said \nhe borrowed money for student loans in 2000 and made some payments on his student \nloans in 2002 and 2003. On February 28, 2008, he did not have any payment \narrangements with his student loan creditors. He did not sufficiently mitigate two SOR \ndebts totaling $67,247. He did not provide proof of any letters sent or received from his \nstudent loan creditors. The false information in his security clearance application about \nthe status of his student loans damages his credibility. According to his personal \nfinancial statement and his description of his financial situation, he had sufficient income \nto establish payment plans on his student loans. He has sufficient financial knowledge \nand sophistication to contact his student loan creditors and establish payment plans.  I \nheld the record open after his hearing to allow Applicant to address the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.g; however, he failed to do so. Under the circumstances, there are not clear \nindications that his student loan debts are being resolved or are under control.  \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors,\u201d4 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not currently eligible for access to classified information.  \n \n4See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nPARAGRAPH 1, GUIDELINE F:   \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h to 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k and 1.l: \n For Applicant (Withdrawn) \nSubparagraphs 1.m to 1.o:  \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant (Withdrawn)   \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on November 17, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on December 8, 2009. The government offered four exhibits (GE) 1 through\n4, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified\non her own behalf. She submitted fourteen exhibits (AE) A through N, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on December 22, 2009. I held the record open for Applicant to submit\nadditional documentation. She timely submitted four exhibits, AE O through AE R,\nwithout objection. The record closed on January 8, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on November 24, 2009. (Tr. 9.) I advised\nApplicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the\nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days notice. (Id.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.f of the SOR, with explanations. She admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a\nof the SOR, but denied she intentionally falsified her answer.  She also provided\n1\nadditional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.\n  \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, works as a photo editor for a Department of\nDefense contractor. Applicant began her journalism career in 1990 as a newspaper\nreceptionist. She developed her work skills, which resulted in new positions as an\neditorial clerk, online producer, and her present position beginning in May 2008.2\nApplicant married in 1999 and divorced in 2004. She has no children. She has\nattended college, but does not have a degree. She plans to continue her education with\na bachelor\u2019s degree as her goal.3\n\nTr. 28-29.\n4\nId. 26, 30.\n5\nAE C; Tr. 26-27.\n6\nTr. 30.\n7\nGE 1; AE M; Tr. 27, 31-33.\n8\n3\nAfter her divorce, Applicant\u2019s household income decreased from $80,000 (joint\nincome) to $25,000 (her income only). She and her former husband agreed that he\nwould assume responsibility for their house and she would keep her car. She moved\ninto an apartment with a roommate and shared living expenses. She managed her\nfinances.4\nWithin a few months of her divorce, Applicant learned that her mother was\nseriously ill and needed her assistance. In December 2004, Applicant took a leave of\nabsence from her job to care for her mother, who lived many miles from her. Before she\nleft, Applicant paid her share of her rent and utilities. She did not have a car payment.\nHer plane ticket home was expensive.   \n5\nShe assumed that her grandmother could assist her with the care of her mother.\nWhen she arrived at her mother\u2019s home, she realized that her grandmother was in ill\nhealth and not able to help with her mother\u2019s care. Rather, Applicant began caring  for\nher grandmother and mother. Her grandmother died six months later.6\nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s only source of income is Social Security payments.\nMedicare paid for a significant portion of her mother\u2019s medical expenses, but did not pay\nfor all her mother\u2019s medical expenses. Applicant used her credit card to pay these\nexpenses, particularly medicines.7\nA few months after her return from caring for her mother, Applicant received a job\noffer with a promotion, which she accepted. Her new job required her to move to\nanother city about 100 miles away. Applicant rented an apartment in her new location.\nShe paid $1,150 a month in rent, plus utilities. Because of the rent costs, Applicant\nterminated this lease prior to its end date. Applicant signed a notice to vacate\nagreement on September 22, 2007, which gave management the right to inspect her\nunit for damage prior to her moving. She did not receive notice of any damage. The\nagreement showed that she owed $2,338 for terminating the lease. She understood the\ntermination costs were two months\u2019 rent ($2,300) and her $500 security deposit. She\npaid this money and lost her security deposit. After giving notice of her early\ntermination, the apartment complex assessed additional charges for unknown costs.  \n8\nWith her new job, Applicant thought her life was good. She then realized,\nhowever, that her finances were out-of-control. Applicant contacted a credit resolution\ncompany and her creditors to develop a plan for her debt payment. She worked out\n\nGE 2; AE H; Tr. 37, 39.\n9\nGE 2; Tr. 31-36.\n10\nId.; AE N; AE P; Tr. 38.\n11\nGE 2; GE 3; GE 4; AE J; AE R; Tr. 40-41, 53-56.\n12\n4\npayment plans with several creditors on her own. The credit resolution company agreed\nto manage three debts for her (allegations 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d). She started payments of\n$53 a month to this company in April 2007. A portion of this money pays a fee to the\ncredit resolution company. The remainder of the money is placed in a savings account\nuntil the company has sufficient money to negotiate a settlement of one of the debts.\nShe now pays this company $58 a month. Applicant described her debt repayment plan\nas a 10-year plan, and this is true for her credit resolution plan.9\nThe SOR lists six debts. The debt in allegation 1.a concerns the apartment lease\nApplicant terminated in September 2007. In her response to interrogatories, Applicant\nprovided a check that showed she paid $300 to this creditor in July 2008. Because she\npaid the creditor $2,300 in 2007, she disputes this debt and does not believe she still\nowes this creditor $3,600. She attempted to negotiate this debt with the creditor without\nsuccess. Applicant has not provided copies of her 2007 payments.10\nThe three credit card debts listed in allegations 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d are included in\nher payment plan with the credit resolution company. Since April 2007, Applicant has\npaid this company nearly $1,900, but it has not paid a debt for her. Applicant negotiated\na settlement and separate payment plan with the creditor in allegation 1.d. The creditor\nagreed to settle the debt for $2,970 and accepted a monthly payment of $117 beginning\nDecember 31, 2008. Applicant has complied with the terms of this payment plan.11\nSOR allegation 1.e concerns a credit card debt for $6,500. The owner of the debt\nhas changed several times. Applicant negotiated a repayment plan with the current\nowner of this debt in the summer of 2008. She made an initial payment of $200 in\nSeptember 2008, and has paid $150 a month on this debt since her first payment. Her\nmonthly payment is automatically deducted from her checking account. This creditor\nagreed not to charge her additional interest or late fees, which enables her to eventually\npay this debt. Based on her payments provided, Applicant has reduced this debt by at\nleast $2,600 as of January 2010. She did not provide proof of her $150 payment in\nJanuary 2009, but given her payment record, I infer this payment has been made.12\nSOR allegation 1.f concerns another credit card debt in the amount of $9,000.\nApplicant negotiated a payment plan with this creditor in the early summer of 2008. She\nmade an initial payment of $200 in July 2008, and paid an additional $1,000 on this\ndebt. Although Applicant has been making regular payments on this debt, the balance\nhas not substantially changed because the creditor continued to assess interest and\nfees. The owner of this debt recently changed. The new owner of the debt has agreed\nnot to charge her interest on her balance. This change should allow her to reduce and\n\nGE 2; GE 3; G3 4; AE Q; Tr. 41, 53-56.\n13\nGE 2; AE G.\n14\nGE 2; AE O.\n15\nGE 1; Tr. 42-43, 48-49.\n16\nAE K; AE L.\n17\n5\nultimately pay her debt. She pays $100 a month on this debt, with plans to increase her\npayment after February 2010.13\nPrior to issuing the SOR, the government mailed financial interrogatories to\nApplicant, listing three additional debts not listed in the SOR. In her response, Applicant\nverified that she paid the small debt and that she developed a payment plan on a credit\ncard debt of $3,542. She paid $200 a month on this debt, with a final payment to be\nmade in  February 2010. She plans to apply this $200 to her above debt plans\nbeginning in March 2010. She developed a payment plan for $50 a month to resolve a\ncredit card debt of $1,100. This debt is paid. (Tr. 51) Applicant also resolved another\ncredit card debt.14\nApplicant earns $4,150 a month in gross income and $2,846 a month in net\nincome. Her monthly living expenses total approximately $1905. Her monthly debt\nrepayment totals $608 a month, for total monthly expenses of $2,513. She has $335 a\nmonth remaining. She does not have a car payment, but did not list her monthly\ngasoline expense, although she did list car insurance expenses. Applicant spends\nnearly 25% of her net pay on debt repayment plans.15\nWhen she completed her security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto the questions in Section 28 about past due debts. Because she had hired a credit\nresolution company, had started payments in 2007, and made efforts to pay her debts,\nApplicant believed her debts were current. She did not have a credit report when she\ncompleted her application.16\nApplicant\u2019s senior editor and director describe her as an excellent employee.\nBoth trust her. Her senior editor opines that she is dependable and intelligent. Her work\nethic and integrity are solid. Her company vice-president and general manager wrote a\nletter of commendation to her for her work in an initiative. Applicant serves as a board\nmember on a community board, a volunteer position.17\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n6\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n7\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt after paying her mother\u2019s\nmedical expenses, and was unable to pay the obligations for a period of time. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries arose\nfive years ago and have continued. This mitigating condition is not applicable. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose when her mother became seriously ill five years\nago, compelling her to take a leave of absence from her job and return home to care for\nher mother. Applicant paid her mother\u2019s medical bills not covered by Medicare with her\ncredit card. By 2006, she realized her finances were \u201cout-of-control.\u201d She initiated\ndiscussions with her creditors to develop repayment plans and contacted a credit\nresolution company to help her correct her financial problems. For the last three years,\nshe has worked to resolve her debts. She acted responsibly by contacting her creditors\nand working towards the resolution of her debts. This mitigating condition applies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant contacted a credit resolution company in 2006 and\nstarted a payment plan with this company in April 2007. This company agreed to help\nher resolve three debts listed in the SOR. She continues to pay this company $58 a\nmonth, which she must do for another 7 years. On her own, Applicant negotiated a\npayment plan with two additional creditors listed in the SOR and one other creditor not\nlisted in the SOR. Applicant continues to pay her agreed-upon monthly payments on\nthese debts. Applicant, on her own, also negotiated a separate payment plan for one\ndebt under her payment plan with the credit resolution company and has complied with\n\n8\nher payment plan for over a year. By initiating payment plans before the SOR was\nissued and complying with her plans for a lengthy period of time, Applicant showed a\ngood faith effort to resolve her debts. She lives within her monthly income and has not\nincurred excessive debt since 2006. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions\napply to SOR allegations 1.b through 1.f.\nApplicant disagrees with the validity of the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.a\nbecause she already paid the creditor more than $2,500. Applicant has not filed a\nformal disagreement with the credit reporting companies nor has she presented any\nverification that she wrote to this creditor and disagreed with the debt. Mitigating\ncondition under AG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue\u201d does not apply to SOR allegation 1.a. \nThe $3,600 in SOR allegation 1.a. is not paid nor is it under a payment plan.\nThrough her evidence, Applicant established her penalty for terminating the apartment\nlease was $2,338. Her testimony that she already paid $2,300 to this creditor in 2007 is\ncredible in light of her payment history with her other creditors and the efforts she\ninitiated to resolve her debts in 2006, 2007, and 2008. She made additional $300\npayment in 2008, but has not paid any more money on this debt as she disagrees with\nthe creditor\u2019s claim she owes $3,600. Thus, this debt cannot be a source of improper\npressure or duress.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and (e)\npersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n18\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n9\nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country,\nengaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that\ncountry but illegal in the United States and may serve as a basis for\nexploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or\nother group;\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in her\nanswer must be deliberate. The government established that Applicant omitted a\nmaterial fact from her e-QIP when she answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 28a, about debts\nover 180 days delinquent, and 28b, about debts currently 90 days overdue. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to her honesty. In her response, she denies, however, that she had an\nintent to hide this information from the government. When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when\nthe omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.18\nWhen she completed her e-QIP in June 2008, Applicant believed that since she\nhad negotiated payment plans for her overdue debts and had been paying on this\npayment plans, her debts were not overdue, but current. She paid her current bills, thus,\nshe did not have any current bills more than 90 days overdue. Her mistaken belief about\nhow her old debts should be considered in the security clearance process does not\nshow an intent to hide information from the government. The government has not\nestablished intentional falsification under allegation 2.a.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n10\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems started when she provided financial assistance to her mother. In\n2004, Applicant earned $25,000 a year. While not a high salary, she could meet her\nmonthly expenses because she shared living arrangements and did not have a car\npayment. Her mother became seriously ill and required her help. Applicant took a leave\nof absence from her job and flew home to help her mother. Before she left to care for\nher mother, she made arrangements to pay her rent and other housing expenses. She\nhas no debt related to these costs. Her mother lives on social security. When medicare\ndid not cover her mother\u2019s medical bills, particularly her medication, Applicant charged\nthese expenses. Between December 2004 and June 2005, Applicant traveled between\nher  residence and her mother\u2019s very distant home, taking unpaid leave from work when\nnecessary. She managed her bills with her very limited income.\nIn 2006, Applicant accepted a new position, that required her to move more than\n100 miles away. She incurred moving expenses and rental expenses. She thought she\nwas doing well, until she realized that her finances were \u201cout-of-control.\u201d She\nimmediately contacted a credit resolution company, and after discussions, retained its\nservices to help her resolve three debts. For the last three years, she has paid this\ncompany monthly. It has yet to resolve any debts for her, most likely because she is\npaying a small monthly payment. Even though she has hired this company, she\nindependently developed a payment plan with one company of the three in her plan with\nthe credit resolution company and has complied with the terms of this plan.\nApplicant independently developed three repayment plans for other debts,\nincluding two listed in the SOR and one not listed in the SOR. She has complied with\nthe terms of these plans and, as of February 2010, will have paid one debt of the three\ndebts in full. Applicant\u2019s normal everyday living expenses are paid and under control.\nShe does not spend excessively or extravagantly. She has a track record for paying her\npast due debts. She knows she will be paying her past debts for sometime, describing\nher debt repayment as a 10-year plan. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all her\ndebts are paid: it is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her\nfitness to hold a security clearance. While her debts are not paid in full, her debts are\n\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).\n19\n11\ninsufficient to raise security concerns, as she does not live extravagantly or beyond her\nincome. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)19\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances and\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all allegations contained in Paragraph 1 of the SOR, except those included in paragraphs 1.a, o, y, z, and dd. Applicant is 28 years old and married. She has two young children. She earned a Bachelor of Science in Behavioral and Social Sciences in 2005. After completing her degree, she worked as a teacher\u2019s aid for minimal wages, until her supervisor promoted her in 2007 to a substitute teacher position. In February 2008, she obtained her current job with a federal contractor, where she works as a family programs assistant, helping families of mobilized soldiers. Her husband is a captain in the Army, on active duty. He has a security clearance. Prior to being activated, he was deployed in 2005 and stationed away from home until September 2006.

On November 12, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR on or about December 5, 2008, and requested a \nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 4, 2009, and issued a Notice of \nHearing on March 10, 2009. The case was heard on March 27, 2009 as scheduled.  \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, called one character witness and offered Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through R into evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the \nhearing, I left the record open until April 10, 2009, to give Applicant an opportunity to \nsubmit additional information. Applicant timely submitted 29 pages of documents that I \nmarked as AE S, and admitted into the record without objection from the Government. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 3, 2009.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all allegations contained in Paragraph 1 of the SOR, except \nthose included in paragraphs 1.a, o, y, z, and dd.  \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old and married. She has two young children. She earned a \nBachelor of Science in Behavioral and Social Sciences in 2005. After completing her \ndegree, she worked as a teacher\u2019s aid for minimal wages, until her supervisor promoted \nher in 2007 to a substitute teacher position. In February 2008, she obtained her current \njob with a federal contractor, where she works as a family programs assistant, helping \nfamilies of mobilized soldiers. Her husband is a captain in the Army, on active duty. He \nhas a security clearance. Prior to being activated, he was deployed in 2005 and \nstationed away from home until September 2006. From about December 2006 until \nAugust 2008, he worked on orders at the command\u2019s headquarters. (Tr. 111)  Currently, \nhe works in Psychological Operations and is stationed in another state. \n \n \nApplicant began experiencing financial problems after her husband returned \nhome from deployment in September 2006 and remained unemployed for about three \nmonths. At the same time, she was earning $300 every two weeks. The situation was \nfurther exacerbated in May 2008 when she had emergency surgery that required her to \nremain home for a period of recovery. At the time, she had not accrued enough sick \ntime to cover her time off. (Tr. 112)   \n  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 31 delinquent debts, totaling $47,931. Many of the debts are \nrelated to medical services for Applicant and her children for which she did not have \nadequate insurance. The largest debt, totaling $26,817, is owed on her student loans. \nAt this time, some of the debts have been paid in full, others are being repaid, and some \nhave been disputed and subsequently deleted from Appellant\u2019s credit bureau report. A \ncouple of them remain unresolved.  Applicant submitted a detailed summary of the \nstatus of the debts in AE S at 1-3, which notes as follows: \n \nApplicant has paid five debts: \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.b for $54 was owed to a telephone company. She paid it on \nDecember 3, 2008.  (Tr. 44) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n2. SOR \u00b6 1.g for $79 was a medical debt. She set up four $20 payments on the \naccount, beginning in January 2009. It is paid. (AE S at 8; Tr. 56) \n3. SOR \u00b6 1. h for $50 and \u00b6 1. i for $50 are medical debts. She sent that creditor \n$100 in January 2009. (Tr. 57)   \n4.  SOR \u00b6 1.ee for $181 is a medical debt. She paid $100 in February 2009 to   \nsettle the account. (AE S at 29) \n \nApplicant has established repayment plans for nineteen debts: \n \n5.  SOR \u00b6 1.c for $467 was owed to a telephone company.  It was settled for \n$233 and she began making monthly payments of $65 in November 2008. It \nwill be paid by the end of April 2009.  (Tr. 47; AE A; AE S at 1)  \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.d for $234 was owed to a telephone company.  It was settled for \n$163 in November 2008 and will be paid in full by the end of April 2009. (AE S \nat1; Tr. 47)  \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.f for $148 is owed to an unidentified creditor.  She paid $25 in \nNovember and will pay the remaining monies in monthly installments by the \nend of May 2009. (AE B; AE S at 1; Tr. 50-51) \n8. SOR \u00b6 1.n for $391 is owed to a credit card company. She set up four \npayments and the account will be paid by May 8, 2009. (AE S at 2, 11; Tr. 62)  \n9. SOR \u00b6 1.p for $798 is owed to a credit card company. The balance of $648 \nwas settled for $336. She began making $50 monthly payments in December \n2008 through automatic deductions, and intends to make the remaining \npayments by May 8, 2009. (AE M; S at 14-15; Tr. 66)  \n10.  SOR \u00b6 1.q for $357 is being paid at $50 per month. She has made two $50 \npayments on the balance.  (AE S at 16-19; Tr. 67-68) \n11.  SOR \u00b6 1.r for $287 is owed to a telephone company. It was settled for $186.    \nPayment is due on May 15, 2009. (AE  at 2; Tr. 68-69) \n12.  SOR \u00b6 1.s is a $12,930 debt owed on a car loan. The account is current (AE \nS at 20; AE E; AE P at 2; Tr. 72) \n13. SOR \u00b6 1. j ($86), \u00b6 1.k ($190), \u00b6 1.l ($215) and \u00b6 1.m ($190) are medical \ndebts. She began making monthly payments of $50 in January 2009. (AE D & \nQ; AE S at 10;  Tr. 58-61) \n14. SOR \u00b6 1.x for $866 is a medical bill. She started paying $25 in April 2009. (AE \nS at 26-27; Tr. 89) \n15. SOR \u00b6 1.t, \u00b6 1.u, \u00b6 1.v, and \u00b6 1.w are school loans. She recently entered into           \n                 a monthly repayment plan for $73. (AE S at 22-23; AE F, G; Tr. 76-87) \n   16. SOR \u00b6 1.bb and \u00b6 1.cc for $250 are the same debt that was owed for parking \ntickets. She made arrangements to pay them in April 2009. (AE S at 29; Tr. \n94) \n \n \nApplicant disputed four debts, which were subsequently deleted: \n \n17. SOR \u00b6 1.o and SOR \u00b6 1.dd are duplicate listings of a $152 medical bill that \nhas been deleted. (GE 2 at 42;   AE P; Tr. 63-66) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n18.  SOR \u00b6 1.y for $118 is owed to a medical creditor that she cannot locate. (GE \n2 at 37; AE P) \n19.  SOR \u00b6 1.aa for $945 is no longer on file.  (AE P; Tr. 92) \n \n \n   \n \nApplicant has been unable to resolve three debts: \n \n20. SOR \u00b6 1. a for $170 (Tr. 44; AE S at 1) \n21. SOR \u00b6 1.e for $145 is owed to a cable company. She intends to set up a \npayment plan in the future after completing payments on some of the other \ndebts. \n22. SOR \u00b6 1.z for $273 is a medical debt that she is investigating. (Tr. 91)  \n \n \n   \n \nIn summary, Applicant has paid five debts, is paying nineteen debts, disputed \nfour debts, and has been unable to resolve three debts. Applicant\u2019s annual salary is \n$39,000 and her husband\u2019s is $40,000. (Tr. 101-102). They live separately, as he is \nstationed in another state. Both of them rent apartments. They formulated a budget with \nthe assistance of a financial counselor on base. (Tr. 101) After paying their bills, they \nhave about $600 to $700 remaining for other expenses. She anticipates a $6,000 tax \nreturn for 2008 that she intends to use to pay off debt. (Tr. 109) She has not used credit \ncards for the past couple years. (Tr. 114) \n \n \nApplicant\u2018s mother testified. She is 56-years old and has worked for the Federal \ngovernment for 18 years. She holds a security clearance and has access to classified \ninformation. She became aware of her daughter\u2019s financial problems after her son-in-\nlaw was deployed in 2006 and her daughter asked her for financial assistance because \nshe was between part-time jobs. Her mother helped her pay for food and other daily \nessentials. (Tr. 25-33) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor is aware of her financial problems, and yet entrusts her to \nmanage an agency budget. (Tr. 117) She submitted three character reference letters.  \nThe commanding officer for her unit stated, \u201cI would recommend [Applicant] for a \nsecurity clearance without reservations. She has been a wonderful asset to our \ncommand.\u201d (AE K)  The unit\u2019s Sergeant First Class wrote that Applicant \u201cis a very \nvaluable member for this organization; that demands a need of high quality and \ndedicated individuals. I endorse her candidacy to be granted a security clearance \nenthusiastically and without reservation.\u201d (AE J) A supervising captain notes that \nApplicant\u2019s character has never come into question and she is \u201chonorable and with \ngreat integrity.\u201d (AE I)  \n \n \nApplicant presented her case in an organized and detailed manner. She has \nbeen resolving the debts through her own efforts with the creditors. (Tr. 116) She has a \ncomprehensive understanding of the importance of responsibly managing her finances, \nin order to maintain her job, which she loves. She hopes to be debt free by the time she \nturns 30. (Tr. 119) Throughout her testimony, she was candid and very credible. She \nexpressed regret that the debts have not been resolved and takes full responsibility for \n\n \n \n \n \n5\npaying them. She does not intend to file bankruptcy as a method to dispose of them. \n(Tr. 126-127).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant began accumulating significant delinquent debt in 2005 that increased \nin amount in 2006, which she was unable to pay or resolve until 2008, after starting \nwork at her current position. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation of the resulting security concern. AG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns arising under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot apply because Applicant\u2019s problems have been ongoing since \n2005 and are not isolated, but involve numerous creditors. Some of the delinquent \ndebts arose as a result of her under-employment, her husband\u2019s deployment and a \nsubsequent period of unemployment, as well as a medical emergency. Those \ncircumstances were beyond her control. During her husband\u2019s deployment, she had \nsome assistance from her mother, but there is no evidence indicating that she contacted \nmany of her creditors while the delinquent debts were accruing. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) has \nlimited application. She presented sufficient evidence documenting that she has \naddressed the majority of the debts with some form of action since the fall of 2008 and \nthat there are \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d \nwarranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(c). She has made a good-faith effort to pay five \ndebts and is paying 19 debts on some type of monthly plan, such that AG \u00b6 20(d) is \napplicable. She disputed four debts and provided evidence of the resolution, triggering \nthe application of   AG \u00b6 20(e). There is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 \n20(f). \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 noted \u201cthat an applicant is \nnot required to show that she completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has \nestablished a reasonable plan to resolve her debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u2019  ISCR Case No. 04-0684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006).\u201d In this \ninstance, Applicant has presented sufficient credible evidence that she established a \nplan to pay her delinquent debts and has taken significant steps to resolve those debts \nover the past six months.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 28-year-old woman, \nwho recently began a position with her employer and appears to be headed for a \nsuccessful career.  Both she and her husband work for the U.S. Army, and he is \ncurrently deployed and away from home as a consequence. She was a very credible \nand articulate witness, and is obviously aware of the importance of managing her \nmoney and establishing a solid financial track record. There is no other derogatory \ninformation in the record that would lead me to believe that her current financial \nsituation would create future security concerns, or that she will renege on her current \nrepayment obligations. To the contrary, I am convinced that she (and her husband) will \ncontinue resolving their financial obligations as soon as practical, including her \noutstanding student loans that constitute more than half of her delinquent debt. The \nother large debt is an automobile loan, which is no longer delinquent.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under her financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n   FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.ee       For Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n___________________________ \nSHARI DAM \n Administrative Judge \n",

The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 3, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept 2.l and 2.u, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 15,\n2009. On June 4, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for June\nAugust 28, 2009\n\nISCR Case No. 03-07826 (App. Board June 17, 2005 at 3).\n1\n2\n23, 2009. It was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I received six government exhibits,\nthree Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. The transcript\nwas received on July 1, 2009.\nProcedural Ruling\nSOR subparagraph 2.u, which Applicant denies, alleges that he was arrested for\nDriving While Intoxicated (DWI) \u201csometime between 1998 and 2000,\u201d and arrested on\nunrelated charges \u201csometime between 2000 and 2002.\u201d Although an SOR does not\nhave to satisfy the strict requirements of a criminal indictment, it must still place an\napplicant on adequate notice of the allegations so that he may have a reasonable\nopportunity to respond and prepare a defense.  Subparagraph 2.u. does not meet this\n1\nthreshold, therefore, I conclude that it is not justiciable.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old single man with four children, ages ten, seven, four,\nand five months (Tr. 44). His live-in girlfriend is the mother of the youngest three\nchildren. His ex-wife, whom he divorced in 1999, is the mother of the oldest child. The\noldest child does not live with Applicant.\nApplicant has a high school education. He served in the U.S. Marines from 1994\nto 1998 (Exhibit 1 at 28). He received an honorable discharge.\nSince March 2008, Applicant has worked as an electronics technician (Tr. 44).\nHe installs closed-circuit televisions, access control systems, and security card readers\nin secured facilities (Tr. 37). His supervisor, who oversees an eight-person staff,\ncharacterizes Applicant as one of his \u201ctop guys\u201d (Tr. 22).\nBetween 2000 and 2007, Applicant accrued approximately $30,000 of delinquent\ndebt, including $13,000 in medical bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c, 1.f, 1.h - 1.j),\n$400 in delinquent utilities (SOR subparagraphs 1.d, 1.g), $7,000 in default judgments\nfor delinquent rent (SOR subparagraphs 1.k, 1.m, 1.o), $9,300 in bank debts (1.e, 1.l),\nand a debt owed to a municipality for $88 (SOR subparagraph 1.n). \nApproximately $12,000 of Applicant\u2019s medical bills, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c, accrued after a serious car accident in 2002 rendered\nhim unable to work for a year (Answer at 1; Exhibit 3 at 4). Before the accident, he had\nbeen unemployed for seven months between December 2000 and July 2001. \nIn March 2009, Applicant satisfied a debt in the amount of $40 owed to the\ncreditor listed in 1.f (see copy of second cashier\u2019s check included on Exhibit B). That\nmonth, he also made a $40 payment to the creditor listed in subparagraph 1.d, and\nsatisfied the judgment listed in subparagraph 1.n (see copy of the other cashier\u2019s check\n\n3\nincluded in Exhibit B). Approximately $115 of the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d\nremains outstanding.\nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend, the lease cosigner, is paying the most significant rental\nproperty delinquency, a $6,300 delinquent judgment, as listed in subparagraph 1.o,\nthrough a garnishment (Exhibit C). Since February 2009, approximately $500 has been\ngarnished from her wages (Id.). Applicant has taken no steps to resolve the other two\nrental property default judgments since they were entered in 2003 (Tr. 69).\nIn May 2008, Applicant applied for a consolidation loan through his credit union\n(Tr. 75). He was rejected because his debt-to-income ratio was too high (Id.). In March\n2009, he met with a debt management counselor who advised him to reapply. The\ncredit union again rejected his application (Tr. 76). His debt management counselor\nthen advised him to get a part-time job to generate additional income to begin satisfying\nhis debts (Id.). Applicant has not yet done so.\nApplicant and his girlfriend earn approximately $1,800 in net monthly income (Tr.\n94). They currently are not paying any of the SOR delinquencies other than the\njudgment listed in SOR subparagraph 1.o, and their monthly expenses exceed their net\nincome by nearly $670 (Tr. 101).\nOn April 29, 1997, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for damaging\nprivate property after \u201ctaking out [his] aggression\u201d toward a fellow Marine by vandalizing\nhis car (Answer at 3). He was awarded forfeiture of $300 pay per month for two months\nand ordered to base restriction for 30 days.\nOn August 21, 1997, Applicant received an NJP for being absent without leave\n(AWOL). He was awarded forfeiture of $500 pay per month for five months, a 45 day\nbase restriction, and 45 days of extra duty.\nIn April 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery of a\nfamily member after an altercation with his then-wife. He was ordered to pay a fine,\nattend marriage counseling, and attend Alcoholic\u2019s Anonymous meetings.\nDuring the past ten years, Applicant has received 17 traffic and automobile-\nrelated civil citations for violations including, but not limited to, speeding, driving with a\nsuspended license, driving with expired inspection stickers, violating high occupancy\nvehicle lane restrictions, disregarding red lights, using license tags improperly, and\nfailing to secure children in car seats (see generally, Answer at 3 through 5).\nCollectively, he has paid more than $4,500 in fines and court costs for these offenses.\nApplicant\u2019s job requires that he drive. He has not received any traffic infractions\nwhile engaged in company business. Since working at this job, however, he has\nreceived three traffic infractions while driving off-duty.\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Applicant satisfied SOR \u00b6 1(n). I conclude it no longer represents a security\nconcern. The remaining delinquencies, however, trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were exacerbated by a lengthy period of\nunemployment in 2001, and a serious car accident in 2002 that generated multiple\nmedical expenses and rendered him unable to work for a year. However, his efforts to\naddress his financial delinquencies over the years have been scattershot. Also, given\nhis limited income, I conclude the fines he had to pay for the multiple civil violations\n\n5\naffected his ability to satisfy his financial delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not\napply.\nApplicant made some payments toward the satisfaction of two debts. He applied\nfor a debt consolidation loan, and he met with a credit counselor. However, his debt\npayments were minimal. Also, the bank rejected his consolidation loan application, and\nhe just met with the credit counselor within the past six months. He has yet to establish\na plan, and he spends nearly $700 more than he earns each month. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c),\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d nor AG \u00b6 20(d),\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve delinquent debts,\u201d apply.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). Typically, isolated automobile-related, civil infractions do not\ntrigger security concerns. Applicant, however, has been cited for such infractions nearly\ntwice per year for the past ten years. The frequent and repetitive nature of these\ninfractions indicates a disregard for state law governing the safe operation and\nmaintenance of motor vehicles. AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\n[including] . . . a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations,\u201d applies. \nApplicant\u2019s most recent civil infraction occurred less than a year ago.\nConsequently, it is too soon to conclude his propensity to violate traffic laws no longer\nrepresents a security concern. None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAny positive inference regarding Applicant\u2019s security clearance-worthiness\ngenerated by his excellent work performance is outweighed by the negative inferences\ngenerated by his outstanding financial delinquencies and his multiple civil infractions.\nUpon considering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions together with the whole\nperson concept, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.u:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2003 listing total liabilities of about $158,320 and assets of approximately $48,750, and that her debts were discharged in September 2003 (SOR 1.a). Applicant was also alleged to owe eight delinquent debts totaling $11,457 as of January 2009 (SOR 1.b-1.h). In her Answer, Applicant attributed the bankruptcy to her spouse\u2019s illness and his inability to resume working. She disputed the debt in SOR 1.b, which was for guitar lessons for her children, the cost of which should have been covered by grant monies that were approved but not received due to a filing error by the lesson provider. Applicant denied owing the medical debt in SOR 1.c. She admitted the remaining debts, which she averred were from a failed business partnership. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 44-year-old administrative assistant, who has worked for a defense contractor at her present duty location since June 2007. She was a temporary employee until March 2008, when she was hired as a permanent employee (Exs. 1, D, Tr. 46). Applicant has three children; a daughter born in 1987, and sons born in 1989 and 1993 (Ex. 1). She and her now estranged spouse married in 1990. For the most part, Applicant did not work outside the home when her children were young (Ex. 2, Tr. 46). By January 2000, if not before (Ex.",

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant and her spouse were granted a discharge of about  $158,320 in debt in\na 2003 \u201cno asset\u201d Chapter 7 bankruptcy. They had medical bills and consumer credit\nobligations that Applicant could not cover on her limited income while her spouse was\ntoo ill to stay employed.  After she and her spouse permanently separated, Applicant\nincurred about $11,457 in unresolved delinquent debt that is only partially attributed to\nthe operation of a business partnership that dissolved in November 2006. Other\nfinancial obligations surfaced that took priority over these debts. Financial\nconsiderations are not mitigated. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 29, 2008. On February 13, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, that provided the basis\nfor its preliminary decision to deny her a security clearance and to refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nDecember 23, 2009\n\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nOn March 16, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision\nbased on the written record. She subsequently elected a hearing. On July 8, 2009, the\ncase was assigned to me to conduct a hearing and to determine whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. On July 10, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for July 29, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Nine government exhibits (Ex. 1-9) and\nfour Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted without any objections. Applicant also\ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on August 7, 2009.\nAt Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record open until August 12, 2009, for her to\nsubmit additional documentation. On August 11, 2009, Applicant offered three exhibits,\nwhich were entered as Exhibits E, F, and G, without any objections.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2003 listing total liabilities of about $158,320 and assets\nof approximately $48,750, and that her debts were discharged in September 2003 (SOR\n1.a). Applicant was also alleged to owe eight delinquent debts totaling $11,457 as of\nJanuary 2009 (SOR 1.b-1.h). In her Answer, Applicant attributed the bankruptcy to her\nspouse\u2019s illness and his inability to resume working. She disputed the debt in SOR 1.b,\nwhich was for guitar lessons for her children, the cost of which should have been\ncovered by grant monies that were approved but not received due to a filing error by the\nlesson provider. Applicant denied owing the medical debt in SOR 1.c. She admitted the\nremaining debts, which she averred were from a failed business partnership. After\nconsidering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old administrative assistant, who has worked for a defense\ncontractor at her present duty location since June 2007. She was a temporary employee\nuntil March 2008, when she was hired as a permanent employee (Exs. 1, D, Tr. 46).\nApplicant has three children; a daughter born in 1987, and sons born in 1989 and\n1993 (Ex. 1). She and her now estranged spouse married in 1990. For the most part,\nApplicant did not work outside the home when her children were young (Ex. 2, Tr. 46).\nBy January 2000, if not before (Ex. 1, Tr. 46), she was in the workforce, employed full or\npart-time depending on the job and home responsibilities (Tr. 46-47). She and her\nspouse legally separated in 2000, after he left her for another woman (Ex. 2). Applicant\nwas awarded child support that he never paid (Ex. 1, Tr. 57). Six to eight months after\ntheir legal separation, Applicant took her spouse back into her home (Ex. 2, Tr. 57).\n\nAvailable documentation shows Applicant had health insurance coverage provided by the state from\n1\nJune 1, 1997, through March 30, 2009 (Ex. B), and with a private insurer from July 1, 1998, through June 30,\n2004 (Ex. A). It is unclear to what extent her spouse and children were covered under either of these plans.\nW hether or not the medical debts should have been paid by an insurer as Applicant maintains (Tr. 19), they\nwere apparently discharged in the bankruptcy and were not alleged in the SOR.\nApplicant was unable to provide a specific date for the permanent separation. Presumably, she and\n2\nher spouse were still together as of the bankruptcy filing in April 2003.\nApplicant testified her spouse was not eligible for social security disability since he worked for the\n3\nstate (Tr. 55). She had told a government investigator in August 2008 that her spouse colleted disability for\none year before his benefits ran out and he was forced to return to work before he was fully recovered (Ex.\n2). He apparently received short term and then long term disability payments paid for by his employer (Tr.\n105). Their bankruptcy petition lists an overpayment debt with the Social Security Administration (Ex. 9). It is\nunclear how this debt was incurred.\nApplicant indicated on her e-QIP that she opened her business in August 2003, which would have\n4\nbeen after the bankruptcy filing but before the \u201cno asset\u201d discharge. It is unclear whether Applicant and her\nspouse reported his retirement assets when they filed for bankruptcy. In response to Department Counsel\u2019s\ninquiry as to when she received the $25,000, Applicant responded it was well after the bankruptcy.\n3\nIn about 2001, Applicant\u2019s spouse became ill with a very painful disease that left\nhim unable to work for an extended period of time (Ex. 2, Tr. 54). Applicant worked part-\ntime while caring for the children and taking her spouse to treatment. He had medical\ninsurance (Tr. 52), and available information indicates that he collected disability for\nabout one year (Ex. 2), but they incurred over $22,000 in orthopedic surgery and\nhospital costs for one of the children (Ex. 9).  Applicant\u2019s income was insufficient to\n1\ncover their financial obligations, including credit cards, car loan, and medical co-\npayments (Tr. 49, 53-55).\nIn about mid-2002, Applicant learned that her spouse had become addicted to\npain medication (Ex. 2, Tr. 41). She did not want him around their children because of\nhis drug abuse, so the next time he needed to be hospitalized, she told his doctor that\nhe did not have a home to return to (Ex. 2, Tr. 59).  They have since lived apart (Tr. 59-\n2\n60). Applicant elected not to file for divorce at that time because she felt that she should\nbury him properly for their children (Tr. 60).\nIn April 2003, Applicant and her spouse filed jointly for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nShe signed the schedules which he prepared (Exs. 6, 7, 9, Tr. 53). They listed\n$149,207.69 in unsecured debt, about $69,138.08 of which was medical debt. Credit\ncard debt totaled about $50,700. They listed as miscellaneous a $7,005.61 debt to a\ncredit union, which was for a camper purchased by Applicant in June 2001 (Ex. 5). They\nalso owed an overpayment of $2,716.13 to the Social Security Administration.  They\n3\nlisted one secured debt of $9,112.36 for a 1998 model-year vehicle (Ex. 9). No assets\nwere available for distribution, and in September 2003, they were granted a Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge (SOR 1.a) (Exs. 6, 7).\nSometime after they filed for bankruptcy, Applicant\u2019s spouse liquidated his\nretirement account with the state, and he gave her about $25,000 (Ex. 2, Tr. 66).  She\n4\nused some of the money to open a nightclub with a business partner in about August\n\nThe collection agency reported a date of last activity on the account of May 2007 (Ex. 5).\n5\nNo evidence was presented to show which business-related expenses, if any, were covered by the\n6\n$5,000. \nApplicant testified discrepantly that she was unemployed until June 2007 (Tr. 77). She is unlikely to\n7\nhave listed the store manager job on her e-QIP if she had not held the job. The available record is silent about\nher income from that job, however.\n4\n2003 (Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 41, 47, 66-70). They leased an existing business with an option to\nbuy, and they also had to pay rent for the premises. The nightclub did well, and\nexpenses were shared jointly, although Applicant frequently used her credit card\naccounts to pay for incidentals for the business (Ex. 2, Tr. 70-71), including the account\nin SOR 1.d (Tr. 71).  Applicant managed to rebuild her credit during the 2004/05 time\n5\nframe (Tr. 41).\nIn July 2005, Applicant and her business partner moved into an apartment\ntogether. Only Applicant signed the lease (Tr. 72-73, 114). They had plumbing, draft,\nand mold problems that the landlord attempted but failed to remedy to their satisfaction\n(Ex. 2). Beginning in about December 2005, Applicant stopped paying the $1,199\nmonthly rent, and in February 2006, the landlord began eviction proceedings. In April\n2006, the housing court ruled in favor of the landlord, and assessed her back rent at a\nreduced rate due to the problems with the residence (Tr. 114-19). The landlord was\nawarded a $3,895 judgment against her for nonpayment of rent (Ex. 8). Applicant\nvacated the apartment as ordered but she did not pay the judgment (Ex. 2).\nAround 2006, Applicant began receiving notices of federal income tax\nassessments for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years when she was\ntogether with her spouse (Tr. 42-43, 103). Over the next two years, she paid between\n$4,000 and $5,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (Tr. 43). In October 2008, she paid\n$221.07 to satisfy a state tax debt for tax year 2004 that she learned about in late\nSeptember 2008 (Ex. 2).\nApplicant\u2019s business relationship with her partner had soured as their lease was\napproaching renewal, and they closed operations in November 2006 (Tr. 75). The\nremaining time on the lease was bought out by another individual for $5,000 (Ex. 2).6\nApplicant was left with business-related debts for which her partner would not take any\nresponsibility, including those debts in SOR 1.d-1.g (Answer, Ex. 2, Tr. 42, 49).\nApplicant collected unemployment from November 2006 until March 2007, when she\nbecame a local store manager for a coffee retailer (Exs. 1, 2).7\nIn June 2007, she left the job for a temporary office administrator position with\nher present employer. Applicant impressed management, and in March 2008, she\nbecame a permanent employee (Ex. D, Tr. 46). In May 2008, she applied for a security\n\nDOHA alleged in SOR 1.d, and Applicant does not dispute owing a wireless telephone debt of\n8\n$1,492. This is likely the cellular phone debt listed on her e-QIP, although the account numbers do not match.\nApplicant testified that she had qualified for a grant for the lessons that should have covered the\n9\nentire cost (Tr. 97), but she provided no documentation confirming the grant. Applicant has not disputed the\ndebt with the credit bureaus but she would like to challenge it in court (Tr. 98).\n5\nclearance, executing an e-QIP on which she disclosed her bankruptcy, a wireless\ntelephone debt of $1,232.89,  and a credit card debt of $992.65 (SOR 1.d) (Ex. 1).\n8\nOn April 5, 2008, a collection agency offered to settle a delinquent credit card\nbalance of $1,685.57 (not alleged in SOR). Applicant opened the account in November\n2004, and made no payments after July 2007 (Ex. 5). The creditor was willing to accept\n$1,349 to settle the debt on payment of $1,000 on or before April 7, 2008, and $349 on\nor before May 7, 2008. Applicant made the payments and the debt was settled as of\nJune 2008 (Exs. 2, 5, Tr. 42, 78).\n A check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 19, 2008, revealed that she was past due\n30 days on her automobile loan for a 2003 model-year sedan taken out in October 2004\nfor $10,857. Also reported were several outstanding collection balances: $1,217 on a\ncredit card account opened in November 2003 with no activity since July 2007 (SOR\n1.g), $1,316 for an unpaid music program debt from 2006 (SOR 1.b),  $432 for dental\n9\nservices from September 2007 (SOR 1.c), $2,185 on the credit card account listed on\nher e-QIP (SOR 1.d), $506 on a telephone landline account opened in May 2006 and\nunpaid since September 2007 (SOR 1.f), and $1,492 in wireless phone costs charged\noff in February 2008 (SOR 1.e) (Ex. 5).\n  \nOn August 20, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout her bankruptcy and subsequent financial problems. Applicant explained that her\nfinancial problems started when her spouse left her for another woman, and then after\nthey reconciled, he became seriously ill. After they separated permanently, Applicant\nreceived no financial support from him, and she was forced to raise their three children\non her own. Applicant disputed the dental debt on the basis that the children were still\nunder the dentist\u2019s care and she had not been notified of a delinquent balance.\nApplicant explained that her former business partner stopped paying her share of some\ncredit obligations incurred for the business. Applicant expressed her intent to resolve\nthe undisputed delinquent consumer credit accounts in her name (SOR 1.b and 1.d-1.g)\nas well as the judgment awarded her former landlord (SOR 1.h). She described her\nfinancial situation as tight but improving, and volunteered that she had been paying her\nother financial obligations on time. Applicant indicated that $400 was being directly\ndeposited into savings every two weeks, and the money was to pay down existing debt.\nApplicant denied owing any delinquent taxes (Ex. 2).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on November 5, 2008, showed no progress toward\nresolving the debts in the SOR, but also no new delinquent debts (Ex. 4). On December\n18, 2008, in response to a request from DOHA for evidence of repayment of the debts\nin the SOR, Applicant provided documentation showing that she had unexpected car\nexpenses in 2008 totaling about $868.65, which together with the IRS tax obligation,\n\n6\nprevented her from making payments on her other debts. She indicated that she could\nnow concentrate on her past due accounts. She estimated a monthly net remainder of\n$1,262.34 that did not include any debt payments. Her parents had lowered her rent to\n$400 per month to enable her to catch up on her obligations. Applicant planned to pay\noff her car loan balance of $3,000 with her expected income tax refund, and to put the\n$253 she had been paying on her car loan toward her other debts (Ex. 2). As of January\n2009, the delinquent balances alleged in the SOR had not been paid (Ex. 3).\nIn early January 2009, Applicant filed for divorce (Tr. 61). She did not seek any\nchild support for their minor child still living at home because she expected nothing from\nher spouse, who was unemployed and had not provided support in the past (Tr. 61-62).\nApplicant provides some financial support for their 20-year-old son, who is in college.\nShe has no tuition obligations but covers some of his living expenses (food, clothing)\n(Tr. 88).\nIn February or March 2009, Applicant received another tax bill from the IRS for\n$169 from when she and her spouse filed joint returns (Tr. 83, 111). She paid it off (Tr.\n111). Applicant received an income tax refund of about $2,100 for tax year 2008 that\nshe put toward her car loan (Tr. 65). She paid off her 2003 model-year car in early June\n2009 (Ex. G, Tr. 78-79). As of late July 2009, Applicant was setting aside $200 per\nweek in a savings account to pay off her old debts. The savings account had a $1,002\nbalance (Tr. 80-81). She recently returned to work after being on short term disability at\n55% of her salary for six weeks because of shoulder surgery. She did not set any\nmoney aside toward her old  debts during those six weeks (Tr. 82). Her plan is to pay off\nthe debts in lump sums, starting with the judgment debt in SOR 1.h (Tr. 79-80). She has\nhad no contact with the creditor in SOR 1.b in the last year or two (Tr. 96), and has not\ncontacted the creditors in SOR 1.d-1.f or 1.h. In July 2009, Applicant learned that she\nneeded about $400 in repair work done to her car (Tr. 90).\nBecause of a recent 6 percent increase in her wages, Applicant\u2019s gross salary\nfrom her employment is now $53,000 (Tr. 91-92). She keeps to a budget but has had no\nformal credit counseling (Tr. 99).\n \nAs of August 2009, Applicant was seeking to have the pediatric dental debt in\nSOR \u00b6 1.c removed from her credit report since her estranged spouse had signed the\ndentist\u2019s payment policy, agreeing to be responsible for balances not covered by\ninsurance (Exs. E, F). She was seeking \u201cinsured spouse relief\u201d from the IRS, which if\napproved, she would be rebated half of the tax penalties already paid (Ex. E, Tr. 102).\nAs of August 11. 2009, she had arranged to settle her telephone debt for half of the\nbalance, and planned to pay it that week (Ex. E). It is unclear whether she had arranged\nto settle both the delinquent wireless (SOR 1.e) and landline (SOR 1.f) debts or just one\nof them.\nAs a member of her office management team, Applicant is responsible for\nmanaging the facility\u2019s contractors and budget. She manages and maintains the office\u2019s\ncorporate credit line. She has given the facility\u2019s security officer (Ex. C) and her\n\n7\nsupervisor (Ex. D) no reason to doubt her competency or her work ethic. Her supervisor\nhas found her to be dedicated and dependable (Ex. D).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to\nbe considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\n8\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern about finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in 2000 when her spouse left her and their\nchildren. After she took him back into their home, he had health problems that\nprevented him from working for significant periods. Applicant\u2019s income was insufficient\nto cover their obligations, and they resorted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003 to relieve\nthemselves of the burden of $158,320 in debt, about $69,000 of which was for medical\nservices. Apparently after they filed for bankruptcy, but before the discharge, Applicant\nwas given $25,000 from her spouse. She used at least a portion of those funds to start\na nightclub business with a partner in August 2003. While the business did well, and\nApplicant paid most of her obligations on time in 2004 and 2005, she exercised\nquestionable financial judgment in starting a business when she and her spouse were in\nbankruptcy proceedings seeking liquidation of sizeable consumer credit debt, and when\nshe could not count on receiving child support payments from her spouse.\nFurthermore, disputes over her responsibility for paying for guitar lessons for her\nchildren, and over the condition of her apartment, led to the debts in SOR 1.b and 1.h in\n2006. After she closed her business in November 2006, Applicant did not pay credit\ncard charges incurred in her name for the business (SOR 1.e and 1.g), and she fell\nbehind in the payments for a telephone landline (SOR 1.f). In August 2008, she learned\nthat her children\u2019s dentist had placed a debt balance of $432 for collection (SOR 1.c).\nAG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d applies. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability\nor unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d is implicated to the extent that she did not have the\nfunds to make timely payments on those obligations.\nFurthermore, there is substantial evidence that Applicant and her spouse were\nspending beyond their means before the bankruptcy, given that they owed over $50,000\nin credit card debt when they filed. AG \u00b6 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant cash flow, high\ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,\u201d also must be considered. Since all\nthe bankruptcy schedules were not made available for review, it is unclear whether they\nreported his retirement assets on the Chapter 7 petition. The evidence falls short of\nestablishing AG \u00b6 19(d), \u201cdeceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement,\nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing\ndeceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d\n\n9\nConcerning potential factors in mitigation, Applicant has not resolved the debts in\nthe SOR despite a gross salary of at least $50,000 annually since she became a full-\ntime permanent employee in March 2008. Under the circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nThere is evidence of mitigating circumstances that implicate AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstance.\u201d Concerning the debts discharged in bankruptcy, her spouse\u2019s\nillness left them without the financial resources to satisfy their financial obligations.\nThen, after Applicant and her business partner decided to cease operations, Applicant\nwas left with business-related expenses when she was unemployed. Over the past two\nyears, she has repaid between $4,000 and $5,000 in assessed federal income tax debt\nwith no help from her estranged husband.  As of the fall of 2008, she was still paying\nstate taxes owed from when she and her spouse had filed jointly. Then in February or\nMarch 2009, she was assessed another $169 in federal taxes. Applicant testified\ncredibly that the tax debts came as a surprise to her, and they hampered her ability to\nrepay her other obligations. More recently, she was out of work for six weeks following\nshoulder surgery. Her temporary disability pay was only 55% of her salary. However,\nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not completely mitigate the financial judgment concerns in this case,\nincluding her questionable decisions to put all or part of $25,000 into a business that\nhad no guarantee of success and to stop paying her rent starting in December 2005.\nThe housing court found some merit to her complaints about the premises, but did not\ncompletely eliminate her responsibility for back rent.\nAG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d has not been satisfied, despite the evidence submitted after the hearing which\nindicates that Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse signed the pediatric dentist\u2019s payment\npolicy. First, the payment policy was signed on March 20, 1998 (Ex. F), well before their\nmarital separation. The debt in SOR 1.c was not incurred until January 2007 (Ex. 4).\nApplicant and her spouse were legally separated, the children were living with her, and\nthe debt remains on her credit record. Applicant also did not successfully disprove her\nresponsibility for the guitar lessons debt (SOR 1.b) in the absence of any documentation\nshowing that the provider received the grant monies that she submits were approved.\nAround early June 2008, Applicant paid $1,349 to settle a credit card debt that\nwas not alleged in the SOR. Yet, despite efforts to put away $200 per week since\nAugust 2008, she had not paid the debts in the SOR by July 2009 because of ongoing\nincome tax and car repair obligations. Applicant has not had any financial counseling of\nthe type contemplated in AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving\ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\n\n10\nresolved or is under control.\u201d While she has a plan in place to resolve her debts, it would\nbe premature to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(c).\nApplicant has demonstrated good faith by paying off the IRS and state tax\nassessments without any help from her estranged spouse, who was jointly responsible\nfor the debts. But she would have a stronger case in mitigation had she used her 2008\nincome tax refund to pay off one or more of the debts in the SOR rather than her car\nloan. Although she expressed a credible intent to save the funds that would enable her\nto make lump sum payments in satisfaction or settlement of the debts in the SOR, she\nhad only $1,200 to put toward the $3,895 judgment as of her hearing. Reduced income\nfollowing recent shoulder surgery is a factor that could mitigate her failure to make\npayments over the summer of 2009, but she put her interest ahead of her creditors by\npaying off her car loan early. As of August 2009, Applicant had made arrangements to\nsettle one or both of her telephone debts but she had yet to make the payments.\nConsidering her financial situation as a whole, AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d cannot fully\napply in mitigation.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant suffered financially because of her spouse\u2019s infidelity, his serious\nillness, and then his failure to support their children. But she also made poor financial\ndecisions in the past that cannot fairly be attributed to factors outside of her control.\nEven if her spouse incurred much of the approximate $50,000 in credit card debt\ndischarged in the bankruptcy, she took out a loan of more than $7,000 for a camper in\nJune 2001. She stopped paying rent in December 2005 because of her dissatisfaction\nwith conditions in her apartment, even though her landlord apparently tried to make\nrepairs.\nDespite temporary and then permanent employment with a defense contractor\nsince June 2007, Applicant has not satisfied those debts in the SOR. The DOHA Appeal\nBoard has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases\nstating, in part, \u201can applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that [she]\n\n11\nhas paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an\napplicant demonstrate that [she] has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve [her] financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). While Applicant\nexpressed an intent to resolve those debts in the SOR for which she is liable, and she\ntestified that she had been saving $200 per week from August 2008 until about June\n2009 to put toward her delinquencies, she had made no progress toward resolving the\ndebts in the SOR as of her hearing, despite an annual salary of about $50,000 and\nmonthly rent of only $400. Evidence of recent payments for car repairs, medical costs,\nand income taxes, does not approach the $8,000 that Applicant would have saved by\nJune 2009 if she had been setting aside $200 every week. Applicant may well have had\nother nondiscretionary expenses that prevented her from settling her debts, but she did\nnot present evidence of any such obligations. There is no indication of recent\nextravagance (she drives a 2003 model-year sedan) or of abuse of consumer credit that\ncould call into question her current spending habits. Yet, based on the evidence before\nme, I am unable to conclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is unmarried and he has no children. He is a high school graduate. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector. The SOR lists 10 allegations (1.a. through 1.j.) regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative Guideline F, with the overdue debts. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR: 1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $958. At the hearing, Applicant testified that this debt for an ambulance bill has been paid. He had been waiting for his insurance carrier to pay for this debt, but ultimately he paid the bill himself. Exhibit F establishes that Applicant paid the full amount of this debt on February 24, 2009. 1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $27. Applicant testified that this debt for a radiology bill has been paid. Exhibit G establishes that Applicant paid the full amount of this debt on November 28, 2008. 1.c.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on February 9, 2009, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 26, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 22, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on June 4, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered\nExhibits1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and one additional witness testified on behalf of Applicant. He also\nsubmitted Exhibits A through M, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June 11, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s\n\n2\nrequest to keep the record open until June 18, 2009, to submit additional documents.\nHe timely submitted a cover letter, and additional documents, which have been marked\ncollectively as Exhibit N, which has been entered into evidence without objection. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nadditional witness, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 30 years old. He is unmarried and he has no children. He is a high\nschool graduate. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 10 allegations (1.a. through 1.j.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, with the overdue debts.  All of the allegations will be\ndiscussed in the same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $958. At\nthe hearing, Applicant testified that this debt for an ambulance bill has been paid. He\nhad been waiting for his insurance carrier to pay for this debt, but ultimately he paid the\nbill himself. Exhibit F establishes that Applicant paid the full amount of this debt on\nFebruary 24, 2009. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $27.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a radiology bill has been paid. Exhibit G establishes\nthat Applicant paid the full amount of this debt on November 28, 2008. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $659.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a video box has been paid. Exhibit H establishes\nthat Applicant owed $432.62 on this debt, and he paid this amount to settle the debt on\nFebruary 23, 2009.\n1.d. This second overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$237. Applicant testified that he also paid this debt to the same creditor. Exhibit H\nestablishes that Applicant paid $242.79 to settle the debt on December 1, 2008.\n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $8,180.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a loan, which was $4,100, but had been increased to\nthe amount stated on the SOR, an amount which was disputed by Applicant, has been\npaid. Exhibit I shows that Applicant made a payment of $500 on February 2, 2009, and\na second payment of $3,600 on February 25, 2009, and the credit reports establish that\nthis debt has been resolved. \n\n3\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $9,654.\nApplicant testified that he is making payments of $100 a week for both this debt and\n1.g., below. At the time of the hearing, he had made 10 or 11 payments. Exhibit E\nestablishes that Applicant had made at least eight payments of $100 from April 10, 2009\nto May 15, 2009. \n1.g. This second overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$7,894. As reviewed above, Applicant\u2019s payments of $100 a week are for payments of\nthis debt and 1.f. Applicant stated that if he continued to pay the amount of $100 a\nweek, he would pay off these two debts by February 2012. However, he averred that he\nplans to increase the payments after all of his other debts are paid so the debt should\nbe resolved sooner. \n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $539.\nApplicant testified that this debt for a gym membership has always been paid on time,\nso it never should have been reported to a credit reporting agency as overdue. Exhibit J\nis a receipt from this creditor, showing that Applicant made a payment of $400 on\nSeptember 2008, to keep his gym membership up to date. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $339.\nApplicant testified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit K establishes that Applicant paid\n$194.08 on November 17, 2008, and he made a second payment of $194.08 on\nNovember 24, 2008. \n1.J. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $110.\nApplicant testified that this debt for another gym membership has been paid. Exhibits D\nand L establish that Applicant paid $161 on this debt, on February  2009, and it has\nbeen deleted from his credit report.\nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties primarily began when he moved\nwith his girlfriend from City A back to his hometown in August 2006, and the cost of\nmoving and establishing new residence eliminated most of his assets. Additionally, his\ngirlfriend was unemployed for a period of time, and his earnings were diminished, so for\napproximately 1 \u00bd years his income was less than adequate to resolve all of his debts.\nHe averred that before the move, he had never been late in paying of his debts. \nThe next year, in August 2007, he moved back to City A. Since 2007, he has\ntaken two jobs, and he has been able to stabilize his finances, and resolve most of his\npast overdue debts.\nApplicant testified that he is current on all of his recent debts. He also testified\nvery credibly that he is extremely motivated to resolve the two overdue debts that have\nnot yet been fully resolved, but on which he has been paying $100 a week (Tr at 59).\nApplicant\u2019s current girlfriend testified on his behalf. She has known him for 1\u00bd\nyears, and she averred that he is honest, hard-working and a man of honor. She further\ntestified that paying his past debts is very important to him. They now pay their more\n\n4\nrecent bills together, and she believes they are not overdue on any of these recent\ndebts.\nIn his post hearing Exhibits, Applicant submitted three Personal Financial\nStatements (Exhibit N), which establish that Applicant\u2019s financial condition continues to\nimprove. Exhibit N shows that on November 3, 2008, Applicant\u2019s monthly net remainder\nwas $30.05, on February 16, 2009, his net remainder was $655.35, and by June 4,\n2009, his net remainder had increased to $784.35. \nFinally, Applicant submitted three character letters (Exhibits A through C). All of\nthem were extremely laudatory in the descriptions of Applicant.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay the majority of his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b),\u201d it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above, the\nfinancial problems arose primarily from Applicant\u2019s reduction in income and his\ngirlfriend\u2019s unemployment for a period of time. Prior to this period, Applicant did not\nhave overdue debts.  Additionally, Applicant has now acted responsibly by resolving all\nof his debts but two, and he has been paying $100 a week to resolve those.  Therefore,\nI find that this mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \n\n6\n Applicant has resolved the great majority of his overdue debt, and  I conclude he\nis responsibly pursuing a course to reduce the last remaining two debts. Therefore, I\nfind that he has mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why Mitigating Condition 20 (b) applies, and considering the positive\ntestimony and character letters in evidence, I find that the record evidence leaves me\nwith no significant  questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a\nsecurity clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns in the SOR. \nFormal Findings\n         Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j.:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\n         In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On May 13, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On January 31, 2011, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\n\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nOn appeal, Applicant raises the following issue: whether the Judge\u2019s decision denying him\na security clearance is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following\ndiscussion, we affirm the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant served on active duty in\nthe United States Air Force for 13 years and since then has worked primarily for Department of\nDefense contractors.  Applicant has held a security clearance for twenty years.  Applicant\u2019s wife\nworked in real estate.  Around 2006, they began buying real estate for rental purposes.  They\nfurnished the properties and provided telephone and internet services in order to rent them to\nmilitary and civilian personnel on short assignments or temporary duty in their area, basing their\nrental rates on the government\u2019s per diem rates.  Applicant and his wife purchased several properties\nin 2006 and 2007.  At first, they were able to rent their properties as planned.  By September 2007,\ntheir rental income declined, and they experienced difficulties in meeting their mortgages and other\nfinancial obligations.  Their problems arose because of the slowdown in the economy and because\nhotel chains built properties that competed for tenants.\nApplicant attempted to resolve his mortgage delinquencies in 2008, but two of the rental\nproperties were foreclosed.  In November 2008, Applicant signed loan modification agreements on\nthe first and second mortgages on his home and one rental property.  As of October 2009, Applicant\nwas in compliance with the modified agreements on both first mortgages.  Also in November 2008,\nApplicant and his wife hired a debt solutions company to resolve $20,000 in unsecured debt.  The\ncompany charged $3,000 for their services.  After several months Applicant and his wife decided\nto withdraw from the company\u2019s plan and resolve their debts themselves.  Applicant has paid several\ndelinquent credit card accounts that were not listed in the SOR. \nThe SOR listed 11 continuing delinquencies totaling approximately $740,000.  The Judge\nfound in Applicant\u2019s favor as to two mortgage debts on the foreclosed properties, noting that credit\nreports show zero balances for those debts.  It is possible that some of the other debts are duplicates,\nbut there is no documentation of that.  Applicant\u2019s wife obtained a full-time job in 2008, increasing\nthe amount of income available for debt repayment.  Applicant has not made payments on the\nsecond mortgages on his home and one rental property and states that he does not have funds to do\nso.  Applicant\u2019s job changed in 2009, but he has not shown how this has impacted his finances.\nApplicant has not explained his inability to continue to meet his financial obligations and resolve\nhis remaining debts.  \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s decision denying him a security clearance is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nAlong with his appeal, Applicant sent additional information about his financial\ncircumstances, including steps he has taken to improve his situation since the Judge issued her\ndecision.  Applicant also sent a letter dated March 22, 2011, with further information.  The Board\nis unable to consider information that was not part of the record, because the Board cannot consider\nnew evidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6E3.1.29.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s decision was based entirely\non the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) including Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR.\n\nIn November 2010, Applicant received a copy of the FORM and had the opportunity within 30 days\nto submit materials to further refute, extenuate, or mitigate the information in the FORM.  He did\nnot do so.  The submission of further information after the Judge issued her decision is not indicative\nof error on the part of the Judge.  \nApplicant states that he is an honest person and would never compromise the interests of the\nUnited States for financial benefit.  He contends that he conducted his financial affairs in a prudent\nfashion and that his current situation is a result of the downturn in the real estate market and the\neconomy as a whole, matters over which he had no control.  In effect, Applicant is arguing that the\nJudge should have found the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F to be mitigated, but\neither did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.  There is a\nrebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence, unless the Judge\nspecifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge mention or discuss every\npiece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06582 at 3 (App.\nBd. Apr. 3, 2009).   Applicant admitted the SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted\nto Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those allegations.   Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular\nfacts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge\nto make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an\nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s argument that he is trustworthy and has held a security clearance\nfor almost 20 years without incident, the government need not wait until an individual mishandles\nor fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable security clearance\ndecision.  See Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039\n(1970).  An unfavorable security clearance decision can be based on circumstances that raise\nsecurity concerns sufficient to preclude a determination that it is clearly consistently with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for a given applicant.  See Department of\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  A history of financial problems is a circumstance that\nraises security concerns.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-00435 at 3  (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2009).  In light\nof the record here, the Board concludes that the Judge had a rational basis for concluding that\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties raised such concerns and that Applicant did not present\nevidence sufficient to extenuate or mitigate those concerns.  The Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable.\nApplicant states that the loss of his job due to denial of his security clearance will have an\nadverse impact on his ability to continue to improve his financial situation.  However, the effect that\nan adverse decision may have on an applicant is not a relevant or material consideration in\nevaluating his security clearance eligibility.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05398 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan.\n13, 2011).\n\nApplicant points out that he rarely handles classified materials and that possession of a\nsecurity clearance is a condition of employment only because of the location of his job.  It is\nirrelevant whether Applicant\u2019s position requires a security clearance for access to classified\nmaterials or for access to a secure location.  Either type of  access implicates the national security\ninterests of the United States and requires a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n12778 at 2 at n. 1 (App. Bd. Mar. 19, 2007).  Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s limited access to classified\nmaterial does not render the Judge\u2019s decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.                    \n   \nSigned: Michael D.

The Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) on May 13, 2010 detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, that provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a\nsecurity clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) implemented on September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 31, 2011\n\nItem 1; Response to SOR.\n1\nItem 1.\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 19, 2010. He submitted a\nnotarized, written response to the SOR allegations dated June 3, 2010, and requested a\ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on November 8, 2010. Applicant received the FORM on\nNovember 22, 2010. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response.\nDOHA assigned this case to me on January 11, 2011. The Government submitted 13\nexhibits, which have been marked as Items 1-13 and admitted into the record.\nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked and admitted as Item 2, and the\nSOR has been marked as Item 1.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR,\nalthough he did not recognize the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He assumed the debt was a\nmortgage debt and therefore his. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 45 years old, works as a security engineer for a Department of\nDefense contractor, a job he has held since October 2009. He previously worked as a\nsenior security analyst for another Department of Defense contractor for six years. He\nserved on active duty in the United States Air Force for 13 years, leaving at the rank of\nmajor. Applicant has held a security clearance for 20 years without incident.1\nApplicant married in December 1987. He and his wife have three children, ages\n24, 21, and 17. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree.2\nAfter leaving the Air Force, Applicant and his wife decided to reside in the area\nwhich had been his last duty station. Except for six months in 2003 when he operated a\nchild care business, Applicant has worked in information technology for government\ncontractors since 2001.3\nApplicant\u2019s wife worked in the real estate business. Around 2006, they developed\na business plan to purchase real estate to use as rental property. After studying the\nhousing needs of the area in which they lived, their plan provided that they would buy\nand furnish a rental property as well as provide telephone and internet services for\n\nItem 4; Item 6; Item 8.\n4\nId.\n5\nId.; Item 7.\n6\nItem 4; Item 6, Items 10-13.\n7\nApplicant indicated that his wife\u2019s net monthly income was $3,500 a month on his personal financial\n8\nstatement. Her leave and earnings statement shows $2,900. He has not submitted any evidence of additional\nincome for his wife; thus, the amount shown on her leave and earnings statement is more reliable and\ncontrols. Item 6, Attachments 9 and 10.\n3\nprospective tenants. They decided to rent the property to military personnel stationed in\nthe area for short periods of time or to civilians temporarily working in the area, using\nthe federal government per diem as the basis for their rental charge. The rent would pay\nthe mortgage on the properties.  \n4\nApplicant and his wife purchased several properties in 2006 and 2007 as part of\ntheir business plan and established a limited liability corporation. Initially, they\nsucceeded in renting their property as planned. By September 2007, their rental income\nhad declined, and they encountered problems meeting their mortgage payments as well\nas other financial obligations. They fell behind in their mortgage and credit card\npayments. Their inability to rent their property arose when the economy had begun to\nslow down, and because hotel chains built properties in the area that competed for\ntenants.5\nIn 2008, Applicant worked with the mortgage companies in an effort to resolve\nhis delinquent payments. He allowed two properties to be foreclosed and renegotiated\nhis mortgages on his home and one rental property. In November 2008, Applicant\nsigned mortgage loan modification agreements on the first and second mortgages on\nhis home and one rental property. He submitted documentation, indicating his\ncompliance with his new loan payments on his first mortgage loans through October\n2009. He provided no information on the status of the rental property that went into the\nforeclosure process.6\nLikewise, in November 2008, Applicant and his wife contacted a debt solutions\ncompany and enrolled in this company\u2019s program to repay approximately $20,000 in\nunsecured debts.  This company planned to charge him $3,000 for its services. After a\nfew months of participation, Applicant and his wife decided to withdraw from this service\nand use the monthly payment to reduce their debts. The credit reports of record reflect\nthat Applicant has paid several past due credit card accounts which are not listed in the\nSOR.7\nApplicant\u2019s wife obtained a full-time job in 2008. He submitted a copy of an\nOctober 2008 leave and earnings statement for him and his wife. In 2008, his net\nmonthly pay totaled $4,800, and his wife\u2019s net monthly pay totaled $2,900.  Applicant\n8\n\nItem 6.\n9\nItems 10-13. \n10\nId.\n11\nId.\n12\n4\nincluded $1,500 a month in rental income on his personal financial statement for a total\nhousehold income of $9,200. His monthly expenses totaled $6,651 and included $3,592\nin first and second mortgage payments and $358 for the debt solutions company,\nleaving a balance of $2,549 each month to pay his debts.9\nThe SOR identified 11 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit\nreports from 2008, 2009, and 2010, totaling approximately $740,000. Some accounts\nhave been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other\naccounts are referenced repeatedly in all of the credit reports, in many instances\nduplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor or collection agency\nname or under a different creditor or collection agency name. Some accounts are\nidentified by complete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account\nnumbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating\nother digits.10\nThe May 9, 2008 credit report indicates that the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and\n1.k are properties in foreclosure, meaning that the mortgagor has obtained the property\nand title to the property. The September 10, 2009, March 16, 2010 and September 10,\n2010 credit reports show a zero balance on both of these mortgage debts. Based on\nthese credit reports, I find that Applicant does not owe any money to the mortgagor on\nthese debts.11\nThe $97,000 mortgage debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j is listed on the May 9, 2008 credit\nreport as a charge off and closed account. This debt does not appear on the remaining\ncredit reports in the record. SOR \u00b6 1.c identifies an unpaid debt of almost $89,000,\nwhich is listed only on the September 10, 2010 credit report. The original creditor and\naccount number are not shown. Applicant did not recognize the debt, but has assumed\nit is a mortgage and admitted the debt. These two debts may be the same, but this\ndetermination cannot be made on the information in this record. These debts are not\nresolved.  \n12\nApplicant has not paid his monthly payments on his two second mortgages,\nstating that he does not have sufficient funds to make his payments. His job changed in\n2009, but he has not provided a new financial statement. He has not provided any\ninformation showing a negative change in his finances. He has not given a reason for\nhis inability to continue with his agreed upon payments and his failure to pay his\n\nResponse to SOR.\n13\n5\nremaining debts. Applicant has not provided updated information on the status of his\nefforts to resolve the debts listed in the SOR.13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \n\n6\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant developed significant financial problems when economic and business\nchanges impeded the ability of Applicant and his wife to obtain tenants for their rental\nproperty. He incurred significant unpaid debt, some of which remains unresolved. These\ntwo disqualifying conditions apply.\nThe Financial Considerations guideline also includes conditions that can mitigate\nsecurity concerns. I have considered mitigating factors AG \u00b6 20(a) through 20(f), and\nespecially the following:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n7\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control, and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began with the economic downturn in 2007. He\nlost income from his rental properties, making it difficult for him to meet his financial\nobligations. He renegotiated two of his four mortgages and his wife started working full-\ntime at a salaried position. He paid some of his credit card debt through payment plans.\nBecause two of his properties went into foreclosure, and since he has not complied with\nhis agreement to pay his renegotiated second mortgages, only partial application of AG\n\u00b6 20(b) is warranted.\nApplicant contacted and retained the services of a debt solutions company in\n2008. He made his required payments for several months until he realized that he could\nuse this money to resolve his debts on his own. He resolved several of his credit card\ndebts, but other debts remain unpaid. He does not owe money on the mortgages listed\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. The remaining mitigating\nconditions are not applicable in this case.  \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\n\n8\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When the\neconomic downturn impacted his finances, Applicant took positive steps to work out his\nfinancial problems. He renegotiated two mortgages; he hired a debt resolution\ncompany; he paid several of his credit card debts; and his wife accepted a full-time\nsalaried job. He provided information on all that he had done in 2008 and 2009.\nHowever, he has not complied with his agreement to pay his renegotiated second\nmortgages, even though these payments are included as part of his monthly living\nexpenses. He has not explained why he cannot resolve the smaller debts listed in the\nSOR, given the $2,500 he has each month after payment of his living expenses. He has\nnot provided information showing a change in his circumstances since 2009, leaving a\nvoid of information in the record about his current finances. He has not provided any\nreason as to why he continues to have these financial problems. Applicant\u2019s lack of\nexplanation about his current finances and efforts to resolve his debts leaves me no\noption, but to deny his request for a security clearance.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances under\nGuideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant has not filed his 2007 and 2008 state \nincome tax returns.  He owes for state income tax for both years, also.  He has not \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprepared the tax returns himself or hired a professional tax preparer to handle his tax \nreturns.  He claims he does not have the money to pay his taxes.  (Tr. 79-89, 116) \n \n \nApplicant owes 17 delinquent debts, for a total of $31,705.  He admits he owes \n10 debts, and denies 7 debts.  Applicant\u2019s financial problems started with his first \ndivorce, and then became aggravated with his second divorce (Tr. 41, 42). Applicant\u2019s \ndebts and their current status are as follows, as listed in the SOR: \n \n1.a. A judgment from 2005 for $4,518 owed to an insurance company \nresulting from an auto accident. Applicant is paying $100 monthly to \nprotect his driver\u2019s license. (Tr. 16, 17, 45-49; Exhibits 2-4, A, B) \n \n1.b. A judgment owed to a friend from whom Applicant borrowed money.  \nHe last paid any money on that judgment in 2005.   The amount owed is \n$1,553, but Applicant claims only $703 is the balance, but has no proof of \nthat amount.  The debt is unpaid. (Tr. 49-51; Exhibits 2-4, D)  \n \n1.c. A cable television debt for $1,044 is owed, resulting from his failure to \nreturn cable equipment when he terminated his service.  This debt is \nunpaid. (Tr. 51, 52; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.d. Another debt owed to a cable television company in the amount of \n$226.  Applicant is not certain about this debt being his debt.  This debt is \nunpaid. (Tr. 52; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.e. A utility bill for $492 owed from 2005 or before that date.  It is unpaid. \n(Tr. 53, 54; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.f. Another utility bill for $359 is owed from 2005 or before that date. It is \nunpaid. (Tr. 54; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.g. This debt is for a satellite television service, and $144 is owed.  It is \nunpaid. (Tr. 54; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.h. Applicant denies this medical debt for $50.  It appears on his credit \nreports.  It is unpaid. (Tr. 54, 55; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.i. Applicant owes $157 on an old credit card debt.  It has been owed \nsince 2002.  He claims he cannot afford to pay it.  It remains unpaid. (Tr. \n56; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.j. Applicant disputes the debt of $1,035 resulting from an earlier \napartment rental. (Tr. 56-59; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.k. One of Applicant\u2019s automobiles was repossessed when he could no \nlonger afford it.  The debt owed to the lender, a credit union, is $13,339.  It \n\n \n4 \n \n \nis unpaid.  Applicant declared it was not a priority to pay. (Tr. 59-61; \nExhibits 2-4) \n \n1.l. This debt for $153 is owed to a telephone company.  It is unpaid. (Tr. \n61; Exhibits 2-4, F) \n \n1.m. Applicant denies this debt for $190 owed to a video rental company.  \nIt remains unpaid. (Tr. 61; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.n. Applicant owes $110 for overdraft fees when his second wife wrote \nchecks not covered by sufficient funds in the bank.  It remains unpaid. (Tr. \n65, 66; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.o. Applicant owes $140 to a grocery store.  He denies this debt.  It \nremains unpaid. (Tr. 66; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n1.p. Applicant owes $6,588 to an apartment rental company for a lease he \nbroke when he received orders for a transfer while in the Air Force.  The \nplaintiff sued Applicant in 2006, but later that year dismissed the lawsuit \nwithout prejudice to file it later. The plaintiff has not filed another complaint \nagainst Applicant. The debt remains unpaid.  (Tr. 66; Exhibits 2-4, C) \n \n1.q. Applicant owes a debt collector $1,007 on an account.  Applicant \ndenies the debt, claiming he has not heard of the company.  This debt \nremains unpaid. (Tr. 69, 70; Exhibits 2-4) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, \ngambling problems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nas required or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of \nliving, increase in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be explained \nby subject's known legal sources of income; and, \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an \nunsuccessful attempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing \nthe bets or returning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of \ngambling losses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling \ndebts, family conflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise five potentially disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s actions demonstrate poor self-control and serious lack of financial judgment.  \nHis unpaid debts extending over several years, and his lack of any reasonable plan to \nrepay them, show these elements of the general security concern under this guideline. \n \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying.   Applicant has 17 delinquent debts totaling $31,705.  He has not repaid \n16 of them, and is paying $100 on one judgment.  Applicant declared he does not have \nthe money to repay debts.  They are not a priority for him. Visiting his four sons monthly \nis his priority, for which he rents cars and pays expenses, thereby reducing the funds he \ncould use to repay these debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 (b) states a security concern arises when indebtedness is caused by \nfrivolous or irresponsible spending.  Applicant has not evidenced any intent to pay the \ndebts.  He does not have a plan, much less a realistic plan under this AG, to repay the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndebts.  His discretionary monthly income of $1,100 he spends on travel to see his sons, \nand other purchases Applicant did not detail at the hearing. The evidence raises this \ndisqualification. \n \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may \nraise security concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt in the amount of \n$31,705.  He has not repaid any of it, and the debts go back to 2002. \n \n Applicant consistently spent beyond his means to repay the debt. His debt \namount, his declared lack of funds to repay these debts and absence of interest in \nrepaying the debts, coupled with a high debt-to-income ratio, makes AG \u00b6 19 (e) \napplicable.  \n \nNext, Applicant has not filed his state income tax for the past two tax years.  He \nowes $3,000 on his federal income taxes for the past two tax years.  He has not filed his \nfederal income tax return for 2008, although he has an extension. He has taken no \nactions to rectify his failures to file his tax returns. AG \u00b6 19 (g) applies.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nOf these six mitigating conditions, only AG \u00b6 20 (b) has any potential applicability.  \nApplicant\u2019s two divorces, in 2001 and 2007, may have affected his financial ability to \nrepay his debts.  But 10 of Applicant\u2019s debts are under $1,000, and he could have \nrepaid them over the past four years, if he had managed his money properly.  Applicant \ndid not demonstrate in any substantive and specific way that his divorces and marriages \nadversely affected his financial situation to repay his debts.  He merely declares he \ndoes not have enough money to repay his debts.  He did not present any evidence of \nany efforts in the past five years to repay his debts.  Now he owes federal and state \nincome taxes, which were not caused by his 2001 and 2007 divorces. He did not \nproduce any evidence that he acted responsibly while his debts were accumulating. \nHence, AG \u00b6 20 (b) does not apply.  No other mitigating conditions potentially apply \nbased on the facts Applicant presented at the hearing.  \n \nHowever, Applicant does have an installment payment plan for one debt arising \nfrom the auto accident several years ago.  A judgment was obtained against him.  Being \ncompelled under a judgment to repay a debt is not the same as having initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay a debt.  But Applicant is paying it regularly, so AG \u00b6 20 (d) has \nlimited applicability for that one debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature adult of 30, \nthe father of four children, and has a job.  He knew what he was doing when he incurred \nthese debts, yet, he has done nothing over the past four years to repay any debt.  He \ncontinues to spend money visiting his children and on other items, but has no plan for \nresolving his debts and managing his money.   He has a legal obligation to pay his \n\n \n9 \n \n \nincome taxes, which he has consistently failed to do over the past two years. He has not \ntaken action to increase his withholding to avoid the recurrence of the yearly \ndelinquencies. He is financially irresponsible, leading me to conclude that he is \nunreliable and lacks good judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \nI conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b. to 1.q:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 6, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application (hereinafter SF 86). On February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended and modified (Directive). The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nMarch 16, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nOn December 29, 2005, the President promulgated revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information, and on \nAugust 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a \nmemorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive \nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the SOR was issued \non or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his \nSOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 3, 2009. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated March 16, 2009, but notarized March 23, 2009, Applicant \nresponded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case decided on the written \nrecord in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was \nprovided to Applicant on April 2, 2009, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a \nperiod of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant received the FORM on December 1, \n2009,1 and no submission was made by the December 31, 2009, deadline. The case \nwas assigned to me on March 5, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nand 1.b. of the SOR, and denied the remaining allegation. \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as \nan ROTC Administrative Technician,2 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance. \nHe has never had a security clearance.3 Applicant never served with the U.S. military, \nbut was a Deputy Sheriff for 27 years before he retired in October 2007.4  He married in \n1985, and is the father of four children, born in 1986, 1987, 1992, and 1995, \nrespectively, all of whom reside with Applicant and his spouse.5 They have resided in \nthe same house since 1992.6 \n \n \n1 There is nothing in the case file explaining the unusual period of delay between the April 2009 submission \nof the FORM to Applicant and his December 2009 receipt of same. \n \n2 Item 1 (SF 86), dated Jun. 6, 2008, at 11. \n \n3 Id. at 31. \n \n4 Id. at 13, 26. \n \n5 Id. at 18-21. \n \n6 Id. at 9. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nUpon his retirement from the county sheriff\u2019s department in October 2007, and \ncontinuing until he secured his present position in June 2008, although he was receiving \nhis retirement pension, Applicant had the misfortune of being unemployed.7 \n \nAt about the time Applicant married, he and his wife made \u201ca conscious choice \nthat [he] would work and she would stay at home so as to not have someone else rear \n[their] children.\u201d8 Nevertheless, she apparently has served as a substitute teacher in the \ncity school system. Over the years, he supplemented his county income by taking part-\ntime jobs \u201cto make ends meet.\u201d9 One of those jobs was running the family trucking \nbusiness.10 Business eventually improved and control was involuntarily relinquished to \nApplicant\u2019s father and siblings.11 Unfortunately, less than a year after relinquishing \ncontrol, the business essentially failed.12  \n \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until about 2003.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d34   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n \n29 Id.; Item 8, supra note 24, at 1. \n \n30 The overdue item fees were incurred on Apr. 12, 2007, and consisted of a $5 charge for each overdue \nbook.

The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d35 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government\u2019s \ncase.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.36  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \n\u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d37 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d38 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n35 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial condition initially collapsed in 2003, when he \nbecame involved in the family trucking business and incurred substantial business-\nrelated indebtedness. Accounts became delinquent and his liabilities increased to over \n$100,000. Unable to resolve his delinquent accounts, despite still holding a position as a \nDeputy Sheriff, he turned to Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code for relief. The result was \nthe discharge of his unsecured nonpriority liabilities. That enabled him to start all over \nwith a clean financial slate.   \n \nNevertheless, more financial obligations were created, and once again, become \ndelinquent because of his inability to satisfy them. His financial difficulties were \nexacerbated with his retirement from the county sheriff\u2019s department in October 2007, \nand his subsequent unemployment until June 2008. As noted above, that same month, \nApplicant was receiving a $1,600.50 monthly retirement pension, and his wife was \nearning $1,342 monthly gross salary. Their combined average net monthly income as of \nJune 2008 was $2,781.33. Later that month, Applicant increased his monthly income \nwhen he accepted his new position. However, Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties caused \nhis delinquent debts to increase to $143,382.95, and once again, he turned to the \nBankruptcy Code for relief. What was initially, purportedly a willingness, accompanied \nby an inability, to satisfy debts, became more clearly an ability, accompanied by an \napparent reluctance, to satisfy them.  AG && 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n& 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ \nApplicant=s financial situation collapsed in June 2003, but was restored with his \nbankruptcy discharge in October 2003. Thereafter, he continued to accumulate \nsubstantial delinquent debt, due in some measure to eight months of unemployment. It \nshould not be overlooked, however, that despite his period of unemployment, Applicant \ncontinued to draw his pension. In June 2008, the same month he obtained a new job, \nApplicant, once again, filed for bankruptcy protection, this time under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code. His liabilities during the previous five years rose to $143,382.95. \nThose new debts constituted \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence.39 The unemployment circumstances have not been present since 2008, \nand both he and his wife have been gainfully employed. Nevertheless, his refusal or \ninability to address his financial delinquencies between 2003 and 2008, along with his \nrefusal to address something as minor as the delinquent charges with the local library, \nraises concerns about recurrence of delinquent debts and his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence fails to establish AG \u00b6 20(a). While the \nevidence regarding the period leading up to the 2003 bankruptcy initially established AG \n\u00b6 20(b), the evidence of events since 2003 vitiates the applicability of this mitigating \ncondition.40  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@41 There is no evidence to indicate Applicant ever received \ncounseling in handling his finances, or guidance on how to address financial \ndelinquencies, or getting his financial problems under control. Likewise, other than \nseeking protection under the Bankruptcy Code on two separate occasions, nearly five \nyears apart, and getting his earlier delinquencies discharged in 2003, there is credible \n \n39 See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. \nOct. 16, 2002)). \n \n40 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his \n[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)).  \n \n41 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nevidence Applicant initiated a good-faith effort in 2008 to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve his debts, but there is no evidence to reflect actual payments under \nChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The evidence fails to establish AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 \n20(d). \n \nConsidering Applicant\u2019s extensive financial delinquencies, one of which \ncontinues unaddressed, and his spending of discretionary funds for everything but his \noverdue debts, Applicant has not demonstrated his financial responsibility.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. When these \nproblems first began, Applicant was a Deputy Sheriff and his wife was a substitute \nteacher in the local school system. He took control of the family trucking business and \nnursed it to success, only to lose control to his family, who eventually destroyed the \nbusiness, leaving Applicant with business-related delinquencies. Unable to meet the \nfamily financial obligations, in October 2003, his debts were discharged in bankruptcy. \nFour years later, he retired from the county sheriff\u2019s department and started drawing his \npension. He also endured an 8-month period of unemployment. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nWhile the unemployment was a circumstance beyond his control, Applicant continued to \ndraw his pension and obtained services and goods from a wide variety of creditors, but \neither had no ability or intention to pay for them. As a result, he accumulated extensive \nnew delinquent debt. (See AG & 2(a)(1) and AG & 2(a)(2).)  Applicant and his wife have \nbeen gainfully employed. While their combined net monthly income in December 2008 \nwas $2,778, not including his pension, he refused to make any good-faith efforts to pay \na variety of delinquent debts until he chose to do so under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy \nCode. Instead, he preferred to wait to pay delinquent debts at a very moderate rate over \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nthe course of 60 months. (See AG & 2(a)(6), AG & 2(a)(7), and AG & 2(a)(9).) While \nthese debts may eventually be paid off, his failure to repay creditors in a more timely \nmanner reflects traits which raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance.  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether \nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nI am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.42 Considering what Applicant had gone through financially and emotionally, \nand mindful of his 2003 and 2008 bankruptcies, intermediate clean slate, the absence of \nany earlier good-faith efforts, and his failure to address his library debt, his current \nfinancial situation, in the absence of any evidence to reflect actual payments under \nChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, is sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. \n(See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:43 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c . . . established a plan to \nresolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the \nextent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n42 See U.S. v.

On January 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) enumerating security concerns\narising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response signed on February 18, 2009, Applicant admitted 2 of 10 Guideline\nF allegations and denied the single Guideline E allegation. He declined a hearing on the\nrecord in favor of an administrative determination. On March 13, 2009, Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Materials (FORM), including 6 attached items.\nApplicant received the FORM on March 26, 2009. He chose not to submit any\nJune 29, 2009\n\n The limited record does not reveal what Applicant did between 1996 and 2002.\n      1\n FORM, Item 3, SOR Response at 1.\n      2\n2\nadditional information in response to the FORM within the 30 days provided. The case\nwas forwarded for assignment to an Administrative Judge on June 16, 2009. I was\nassigned the case on June 17, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file,\nsubmissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant mitigated the security issue raised under\nGuideline E, but failed to meet his burden with regard to security issues arising under\nGuideline F. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 64-year-old security specialist working for a defense contractor. He\nearned a bachelor of business administration degree in management and received an\nhonorable discharge from the United States military after four years of service. Married\nfor 30 years, he has two grown children.\nThe facts of record are scant. Applicant lives in a two-bedroom apartment with\nhis wife and two grown children. He owns a nine-year-old truck and a four-year-old\nvehicle. Applicant submitted evidence regarding two of the allegations contained in the\nSOR, 1.a and 1.j. In opting not to have a hearing, Applicant chose that an\nadministrative determination be made solely on the written record. \nIn 1995, Applicant required a quintuple bypass heart surgery and a 30-day\nrecuperation period. When he returned to his workplace, it was at a reduced salary. His\nhealth insurance covered all medical expenses. The time off and reduced income,\nhowever, led him to default on some credit cards.\nFrom September 2002 until April 2004, Applicant held a string of often short-term\npositions, often as a courier or in security.  In 2004, he began working for his current\n1\nemployer. In January 2008, he suffered a heart attack, followed by subsequent heart\nattacks in February 2008 and in April 2008. He was treated at the same hospital for all\nthree incidents. His health insurance coverage was not as comprehensive as it was in\n1995 and he was unable to pay all of his hospital bills. Other bills were incurred as he\nwas away from work. He has only been able to address his current bills with the aid of\nhis two grown children, both of whom are employed.2\nThe January 2009 SOR references 10 allegations, each representing a\ndelinquent debt or lien noted in either Applicant\u2019s June 17, 2008, or October 17, 2008,\ncredit report. Those allegations, Applicant\u2019s comments in his SOR Response, and\npertinent information from the credit reports referenced in the SOR are as follows:\n\n FORM, Item 3, SOR Response at 5, Attachment A (IRS Monthly Statement, dated Jan. 21, 2009).\n      3\n It is unclear how Applicant concluded the \u201cscope of investigation\u201d is limited to a seven year window. The\n      4\ne-QIP, Section 28(a), inquires \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s),\u201d\nbut Section 28(b) inquires \u201c\u201dAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s) (emphasis added)?\u201d\nThere is no absolute bar to consideration of delinquent obligations originating outside that seven year window\nof inquiry that remain delinquent. Additionally, there is no general law or policy that references to a non-lien\naccount are automatically deleted after appearing on a credit report for 7 or 12 years. The Fair Credit\nReporting Act (FCRA) states that past due accounts can only continue on a credit report for seven years past\ndelinquency. Generally speaking, with regard to Equifax, a delinquent account becomes poised for removal\nseven years from the date of last activity, not necessarily from the date the account was opened. That is its\nmethod of establishing its FCRA Compliance Date. In contrast, TransUnion and Experian now note an\nestablished removal date, which is typically seven years after the FCRA Compliance Date.\n3\n1.a \u2013 2006 Tax Lien (approximately $11,914) \u2013 IN REPAYMENT \u2013 Applicant admits\nthis allegation. He demonstrated, however, that he has paid the balance owed down to\napproximately $3,900 as of February 1, 2009, through a repayment plan.3\n1.b \u2013 2008 Medical Balance (approximately $11,948) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 Applicant\nadmits this balance from his 2008 hospitalizations. Currently unable to make payments\ntoward this balance, he plans to address it once his payments to the IRS are complete.\n1.c \u2013 Collection Entity (approximately $445) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 Applicant denies\nthis allegation, noting that he has never heard of the collection agent named in the\nSOR. The SOR fails to plead the matter with specificity inasmuch as it does not identify\nthat the account is a medical collection, but that fact is clearly noted in the underlying\ncredit reports. The account referenced reflects that it was opened in September 2002\nand shows a date of last activity in April 2002.\n1.d \u2013 Credit Card Collection (approximately $2,864) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 Applicant\ndenies this allegation, writing the \u201caccount is at least twelve years old. It should not be\non my credit report and should not be considered since it is well beyond the seven year\nscope of the investigation.\u201d The credit report notes that the account was opened in\n1998 and reflects a date of last activity in March 2002.  \n4\n1.e \u2013 Credit Card Collection (approximately $5,432) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 Applicant\ndenied this allegation with the same comment noted above. The credit report notes that\nthe account was opened in 1998 and also reflects a date of last activity in March 2002.\n1.f \u2013 Credit Card Collection (approximately $2,666) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 Applicant\ndenied this allegation with the same comment noted above. The credit report notes that\nthe account was opened in 1999 and reflects a date of last activity in August 2002.\n1.g \u2013 Creditor (approximately $1,755) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 In denying this allegation,\nApplicant wrote \u201cThis account is not on my credit report. I don\u2019t know what it is and as\n\n This allegation is generic and has not been pled with sufficient specificity. Consequently, it fails to give\n      5\nApplicant sufficient notice as to whom he owe the amount alleged.\n FORM, Item 3, SOR Response at 6, Attachment B (Account Summary).\n      6\n FORM, Item 4 (e-QIP) at 29-30.\n      7\n4\nfar as I know I do not owe it.\u201d No evidence was provided showing this account has been\ndeleted. The date of last activity on the account is shown as September 2002.5\n1.h \u2013 Telecommunications Provider (approximately $699) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013\nApplicant denies this allegation, but admits having had an account with the noted\nprovider\u2019s predecessor. He wrote that he requested his service be cancelled because of\npoor reception, but that a customer retention specialist would not comply. He asserts\nthat the company kept the account open \u201cuntil a sizeable debt was incurred and then\ncancelled the service and began collection proceedings. This is an artificial debt\nincurred through unscrupulous business practices and I do not owe it. In any case, this\ndebt is over seven years and should not be considered since it is beyond the seven\nyear scope of this investigation.\u201d The account, however, is shown as opened in May\n2007 with a date of last activity in June 2007.\n1.i \u2013 Credit Card Collection (approximately $3,097) \u2013 UNADDRESSED \u2013 Applicant\ndenies this allegations, noting \u201cI have never done business with this [entity] and do not\nknow if I incurred this or not. If I did, this account is at least twelve years old. It should\nnot be on my credit report and should not be considered since it is well beyond the\nseven year scope of this investigation.\u201d Applicant provided no evidence that he has\ndisputed this account\u2019s inclusion on his credit report. The account is shown as opened\nin September 1997 with a date of last activity in October 2002.\n1.j \u2013 Telecommunications/Cable Provider (approximately $103) \u2013 PAID \u2013 Applicant\ndenies this allegation, showing that the account balance was previously paid and that\nhe is currently a customer in good standing with this provider.6\nIn executing his June 2008 e-QIP, Section 28(a) and (b) (\u201cYour Financial\nDelinquencies\u201d), Applicant denied currently being over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s). He similarly denied having been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s) in the\nlast seven years. In response to Section 27(c) (\u201cYour Financial Record\u201d), he answered\naffirmatively that he had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or\nother debts in the last seven years. He supplemented this admission with a full\ndescription of the action, noting that he was in repayment on an installment agreement.7\nIn concluding his four page SOR Response, Applicant wrote: \u201cI am a financially\nresponsible person. If you consider only my indebtedness within the last seven years\nspecified in the e-QIP questionnaire, the only problem I have encountered is with [the\nhospital in which he thrice received treatment in 2008] and I will start paying that as\nsoon as I am financially able.\u201d He concluded by noting: \u201cIn short, I do not pose a\nsecurity risk and my application for a security clearance should be approved.\u201d\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      8\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      10\n5\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n8\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n9\n10\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\n\n Id.\n      11\n Id.\n      12\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n      13\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n      14\n6\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n11\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\n12\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  Nor does it reflect badly on that\n13\nperson\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) to be the most pertinent to the\ncase. Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth where applicable and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, failure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.14\nThe Directive sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline. \nHere, Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect a number of delinquent accounts which\nrepresent approximately $40,000. He demonstrated substantial repayment on the debt\nnoted in allegation 1.a for $11,914 and full payment of a prior delinquent balance on the\naccount noted in allegation 1.j for $103. That leaves approximately $27,900 left\nunaddressed, including approximately $12,000 in 2008 medical bills. Applicant admits\nhe is currently unable to make payments on other accounts until he has completed\npaying off the IRS lien noted in allegation 1.a. Such facts and such an inability give rise\nto Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d). With such conditions raised, the burden shifts to Applicant to\novercome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \n\n W hile Applicant\u2019s 1995 multiple bypass surgery, protracted recovery, and reduced salary were clearly\n      15\nbeyond his control, Applicant provided no nexus between these events and the debts at issue in the SOR. \n Contrary to Applicant\u2019s comments and assertions, none have a date of last activity within seven years of\n      16\nthe SOR and none were over a dozen years old at that time. \n AG \u00b6 15.\n      17\n7\nThe facts present situations tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s acquisition of debt.15\nAlthough he held a string of mostly short term positions from 2002 through 2004, there\nis no indication of adverse conditions or unemployment during this period. In 2008,\nhowever, he faced three successive heart attacks and related hospitalizations. This also\nrequired time away from work and from generating income. Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) applies to debts related to this\nperiod and his subsequent ability to honor his obligations. \nAside from his 2008 medical bills and his tax lien, toward which Applicant has\nbeen in repayment, Applicant still has about $17,000 in delinquent debt. Most of that\n$17,000 is in credit card debt and have dates of last activity in 2002.  There is no\n16\nevidence he sought financial counseling. Moreover, having chosen an administrative\ndetermination, there was no opportunity to elicit testimony as to what occurred in 2002\nto cause their delinquency. Based on the facts presented, however, it is clear that they\nsignificantly post-date his 1995 hospitalization, pre-date his recent 2008 medical\nemergencies, and remain unaddressed. Also lacking is information tending to mitigate\nthe fact that his delinquent debts continued to be unaddressed through 2008.\nConsequently, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d)\ndoes not apply. \nIn light of Applicant\u2019s success in diligently repaying his IRS tax lien, FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts\u201d) applies to a limited degree.\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance\nprocess.  \n17\n\n8\nOn his e-QIP, Applicant denied being currently over 90 days delinquent on any\ndebts. He also denied having had any debts that were delinquent for over 180 days in\nthe past seven years. His SOR response indicates he answered \u201cno\u201d based on an\nincorrect understanding of either the questions, credit bureau reporting, his personal\nfinancial situation, or the scope of the security clearance application investigation when\nhe completed the e-QIP. A misunderstanding, however, is not the equivalent of an\nintent to mislead, falsify, or conceal. This is especially true in light of his comprehensive\nanswer to Section 27, which gave notice of financial issues and evidenced both candor\nand an attention to detail. Similarly, there is no indication that he yet understands why,\ngiven his misconceptions, his answer was incorrect. Therefore, none of the available\ndisqualifying conditions apply and security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature man who earned a college degree, maintained a marriage\nof 30 years, and raised two children. He lives simply and exercises parsimony. Several\nserious medical conditions have demanded immediate medical care and protracted\nperiods of recovery. Each such bout was costly and impacted both his ability to work\nand to generate income. Related debt is a significant percentage of his overall\ndelinquent debt. It is apparent that he is not unwilling to meet his obligations, but is\nsimply unable. \nWhat stands in stark contrast to Applicant\u2019s 2008 medical debt and his IRS tax\nlien, on which he has been making regular payments, is the balance of his delinquent\n\n9\ndebt. It represents nearly half of the delinquent debt at issue. Either because of his\ninability to identify some of the accounts noted in his credit report, or because he\nbelieves debts older than seven years are somehow barred from consideration, the\norigin of those delinquent debts is unstated. Also unstated is why they were neglected\nfrom the time they first became delinquent in 2002 until, at least, his 2008\nhospitalizations. Unexplained, those delinquent debts remain enigmatic and financial\nsecurity concerns remain unmitigated. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response indicates he misunderstands the provisions of FCRA\nor fails to appreciate the parameters of the security clearance application process.\nBased on that response, Applicant did not indicate his delinquent debts because he\nthought they were outside the scope of the investigation. Given that incorrect belief, his\nnegative answers in Section 28 were appropriate. There is no indication of fraud.\nIndeed, his answer to Section 27 provided detailed information regarding his tax lien,\nthus providing investigators sufficient information upon which to conclude finances were\nan issue. In light of these facts, Applicant mitigated personal conduct security concerns.\nThe ultimate burden is on an applicant to mitigate security concerns raised in the\nSOR. As noted, this is a difficult task to accomplish through an administrative\ndetermination. While Applicant mitigated personal conduct security concerns, financial\nconcerns remain. Consequently, it is not clearly consistent with national security to\ngrant him a security clearance. As previously stated, a security clearance denial is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant, nor does it reflect badly on\nthat person\u2019s character. It is merely an indication that the applicant failed to meet the\nstrict guidelines established for issuing a security clearance. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\nARTHUR E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.p-1.t, 2.a, and 2.b. At the hearing, she stated she did not intend to admit intentionally lying on her security clearance application (Tr. 11). For the purposes of this decision, I have treated her response as denying the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor. She graduated from high school in June 1999, worked for various employers from January 2000 to August 2005, worked as an independent contractor from August 2005 to August 2006, and was unemployed from August 2006 until June 2008, when she began working for her current employer. She is unmarried, lives with her parents, and is financially responsible only for herself. She has never held a security clearance. In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) dated October 3, 2008, listing net monthly income of $1,241, expenses of $634, debt payments of $783, and a net monthly shortfall of $176. Her only housing expense is a monthly contribution of about $107 for utilities (GX 4 at 5). She commented on the bottom of her PFS that some of the debts were not hers but belong to family members. Applicant\u2019s father and brother have the same name, and her name is a feminine version of her father\u2019s name (Tr. 25-26). ",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on June 5, 2008. On \nDecember 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nMay 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 13, 2009; answered it on January 14, \n2009; and requested a determination on the record. DOHA received the request on \nJanuary 21, 2009. Department Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge on February 6, 2009 (Hearing Exhibit I), and was ready to proceed on February \n16, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2009. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on February 18, 2009, scheduling the hearing for March 6, 2009. The hearing \nwas cancelled on March 5, 2009, because of a contract dispute with the court reporting \nfirm.  \n \nOn March 13, 2009, DOHA issued a second notice of hearing rescheduling the \nhearing for April 2, 2009. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel also \nsubmitted a demonstrative exhibit summarizing his evidence, and it is marked as \nHearing Exhibit II. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nE, which were admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to hold the \nrecord open until April 17, 2009, to enable her to submit additional documentary \nevidence. She timely submitted AX F through HH, which were admitted without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding AX F through HH are attached to \nthe record as Hearing Exhibit III. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 15, 2009. \nThe record closed on April 17, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, \n1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.p-1.t, 2.a, and 2.b. At the hearing, she stated she did not intend to admit \nintentionally lying on her security clearance application (Tr. 11). For the purposes of this \ndecision, I have treated her response as denying the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. \nHer admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor. She \ngraduated from high school in June 1999, worked for various employers from January \n2000 to August 2005, worked as an independent contractor from August 2005 to August \n2006, and was unemployed from August 2006 until June 2008, when she began \nworking for her current employer. She is unmarried, lives with her parents, and is \nfinancially responsible only for herself. She has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement (PFS) dated October 3, 2008, listing net monthly income of $1,241, expenses \nof $634, debt payments of $783, and a net monthly shortfall of $176. Her only housing \nexpense is a monthly contribution of about $107 for utilities (GX 4 at 5). She \ncommented on the bottom of her PFS that some of the debts were not hers but belong \nto family members. Applicant\u2019s father and brother have the same name, and her name \nis a feminine version of her father\u2019s name (Tr. 25-26). At the hearing, she testified her \nnet monthly income is now about $1,400, not including overtime pay (Tr. 29). All the \ndebts listed on her PFS were resolved after the PFS was submitted. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling about $24,962, based on \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) dated October 15, 2008 (GX 2), and June 20, \n2008 (GX 3). With the exception of the student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.t, all the debts \nhad been delinquent for more than a year when she submitted her security clearance \napplication. On her application, she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28a, asking if she had \nbeen more than 180 days delinquent on any debts during the last seven years. She also \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to question 28b, asking if she was currently more than 90 days \ndelinquent on any debts. Finally, she answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27d, asking if she had \nany unpaid judgments against her in the last seven years. She did not disclose any of \nthe debts and the unpaid judgment alleged in the SOR, even though she was aware of \nthem. She testified she did not disclose the delinquent debts because she was afraid \nshe would not be hired for her current job if she disclosed them (Tr. 57). She \nacknowledged them when she was interviewed by a security investigator in August \n2008 (GX 5). She testified her immediate supervisor and branch manager are generally \naware of her financial problems, but she has not told them the details (Tr. 57-58). \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence regarding the delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount Status \nEvidence \n1.a \nSatellite Dish \n$832 \nPaid \nAX J; AX S; GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 4 \n1.b \nTuition \n$813 \nPaid \nAX K; Tr. 27; GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 12 \n1.c \nCell Phone \n$426 \nUnpaid \nTr. 39; GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 12 \n1.d \nComputer \n$1,935 \nUnpaid \nTr. 40; GX 2 at 2 \n1.e \nCredit Card \n$19 \nUnpaid \nTr. 41; GX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 10 \n1.f \nTuition \n$5,820 \nUnpaid \nTr. 41-43; GX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 11 \n1.g \nTax Lien \n$595 \nFather\u2019s debt  \nTr. 43; GX 3 at 4 \n1.h \nCredit Card \n(judgment) \n$2,568 \nFather\u2019s debt \nAX I; Tr. 44; GX 3 at 4 \n1.i \nCredit Card \n$1,209 \nPaid \nGX 4 at 6; AX D; Tr. 45; GX 3 at 5 \n1.j \nCredit Card \n$1,801 \nSettled \nAX P; Tr. 47-48; GX 3 at 6 \n1.k \nCredit Card \n$1,986 \nMother\u2019s debt \nAX N; AX O; GX 3 at 6 \n1.l \nCredit Card \n$1,521 \nFather\u2019s debt \nAX H; GX 3 at 6 \n1.m \nCell Phone \n$314 \nSame as 1.q \nTr. 50; GX 3 at 7 \n1.n \nCell Phone \n$1,081 \nBrother\u2019s debt \nTr. 51; GX 3 at 8 \n1.o \nTuition \n$1,968 \nBrother\u2019s debt \nAX L; GX 3 at 8 \n1.p \nCredit Card \n$417 \nUnpaid \nTr. 52; GX 3 at 9 \n1.q \nCell Phone \n$197 \nPaid \nAX HH; Tr. 50-51; GX 3 at 13 \n1.r \nCell Phone \n$583 \nUnpaid \nTr. 53; GX 3 at 13 \n1.s \nMedical Bill \n$50 \nUnpaid \nTr. 53; GX 3 at 14 \n1.t \nStudent Loan \n$827 \nBrother\u2019s debt \nAX M; Tr. 54; GX 3 at 21 \n \n \nApplicant forfeited a scholarship and incurred the tuition debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b by failing to complete the classes (Tr. 37). She incurred the tuition debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f believing she would receive financial aid, but she dropped out and was billed \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfor the tuition (Tr. 41-42). She attributed her other delinquent debts to periods of \nunemployment. However, her credit reports reflect that the delinquent debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.f, 1.i, 1.m, 1.n., 1.p, and 1.q became delinquent before she became \nunemployed in August 2006. \n \n \nApplicant paid the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j two months after she was \nquestioned about her debts by a security investigator (AX P and W). She paid the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i, and 1.q after she received the notice of \nhearing (AX D, J, K, P, S, and HH). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n\n \n5 \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts totaling about $24,962. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \n\u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 \n19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) \nis raised when there is Aconsistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ Applicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), (c), and (e), shifting the burden to her to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nnot the result of unusual circumstances, and cast doubt on her good judgment. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant\u2019s unemployment from August 2006 to \nJune 2008 was beyond her control. Nevertheless, I conclude this mitigating condition is \nnot fully established because many of her debts became delinquent while she was still \nemployed. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Applicant has resolved the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, and 1.q. Accordingly, I conclude this mitigating condition is \nestablished for those debts. \n  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \nestablished that seven debts were incurred by family members and were erroneously \nreported on her CBRs. Accordingly, I conclude this mitigating condition is established \nfor the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.t. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified her security clearance application by \nanswering \u201cno\u201d to three questions about her financial history and failing to disclose her \ndelinquent debts and an unpaid judgment. The concern under this guideline is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is \u201cdeliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \n\n \n7 \n \n \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nThe unpaid judgment was entered against Applicant\u2019s father and was not her \nresponsibility, but she admitted she intentionally concealed her own delinquent debts \nfor fear of not being hired. Her admission raises AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant \nmade no effort to correct the omissions until she was confronted with the evidence. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Applicant\u2019s falsifications were \nnot minor, because candor is essential in security matters. Although her conduct was \nnot alleged under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), I note that intentional omission of \nrelevant and material information on her security clearance application was a violation \nof 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years. \nHer falsifications were recent, pertained to her current application for a clearance, and \ndid not occur under \u201cunique circumstances.\u201d The record reflects no other falsifications, \nbut her lack of candor on her security clearance applicant casts doubt on her reliability \nand trustworthiness. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). Applicant receives some credit under this \nmitigating condition because she disclosed her financial problems to her superior, albeit \nin general terms. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is relatively young and inexperienced, but she demonstrated \nconsiderable sophistication in challenging erroneous entries on her CBRs and \nnegotiating settlements of some of her delinquent debts. She incurred many of her \ndelinquent debts by overspending while gainfully employed. She deserves credit for \nmaking a good start toward financial stability, but her settlement of five delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR did not occur until after she was questioned about them. Four of the \nfive were not paid until she received the notice of hearing.  \n \n \nI have considered the Appeal Board decisions recognizing that an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each and every debt alleged \nin the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008). An applicant need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There \nalso is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts \nsimultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid \nfirst. Id. On the other hand, I have considered Applicant\u2019s pattern of enrolling in college \nclasses and then dropping out, her long record of financial neglect, and her failure to \nbegin resolving her delinquent debts until she realized her clearance and her job were \nat risk. Based on this record, I am not convinced she will continue resolving her \ndelinquent debts after she is relieved of the pressure of obtaining a clearance.  \n \n \nSeparate and apart from her financial situation, Applicant\u2019s lack of candor on her \nsecurity clearance application raises serious doubts about her reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \u201cAn applicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid \nanswers to the government in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program.@ ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.o: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On December 15, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On April 29, 2009, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOn appeal Applicant submitted new evidence.  The Board cannot consider Applicant\u2019s new\nevidence on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not correctly weigh Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Applicant argues that this evidence was\nsufficient to warrant a favorable decision.  Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner\nthat is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd.\nOct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations and had only very recently started to resolve his financial problems.  In light of the\nforegoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence\noffered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered\nthe possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant\nas to twelve of the SOR factual allegations, but reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence\nwas insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case\nde novo.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,\n\n3\n371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when\n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v.
