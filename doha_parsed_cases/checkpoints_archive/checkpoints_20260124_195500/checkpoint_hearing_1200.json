Haave, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security to DOHA Director, Adjudication of Trustworthiness \nCases (Nov. 19, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on January 9, 2018.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  On July 17, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD), issued an SOR detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations regarding Applicant.  The action was taken \nunder the Directive. Specifically, Security Executive Agent Directive 4, (SEAD 4) and \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 15, 2019.  She requested that her case be \ndecided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 3.)  On \n\n2 \nSeptember 3, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing eight Items, was \nmailed to Applicant and received by her on September 9, 2019.  The FORM notified \nApplicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant responded to \nthe FORM. She objected to Item 5, the Personal Subject Interview.  Her objection was \nsustained, and Item 5 was not admitted into evidence.  Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 were \nadmitted into evidence with consideration of any noted corrections made by Applicant.  \nThe Items that were admitted into evidence are hereinafter referenced as Government \nExhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8.     \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 40 years old.  She is married with four children.  She has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree in Nursing.  She is employed as a Triage Nurse for Tricare.  She is \nseeking access to sensitive information in connection with her employment.    \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government opposes Applicant\u2019s request for access to sensitive information \non the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following \nfindings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is not eligible for a public trust position \nbecause she is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds.  The SOR identified five delinquent debts totaling in excess of $65,572.  \nApplicant admitted allegations 1.a., and 1.b., and denied the remaining allegations \nunder this guideline.  However, credit reports of the Applicant dated April 23, 2019; and \nJanuary 30, 2018, reflect that each of the debts are still owing.  (Government Exhibits 6 \nand 7.)   \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application indicates that she has worked as a \npediatric care coordinator for Company A since December 2015, and has \nsimultaneously worked as an on-call staff/triage nurse with Company B since February \n2018.   \nApplicant was married in 2001 and has been employed in the nursing field since \n2007.  She attributes her delinquent debts to years of marital discord, including periods \nof separation from her spouse, since 2007, which led to significant fluctuations in her \nhousehold income and rapidly compiling expenses.  Over the years she has not been a \ngood record keeper, and has not been aware of the specifics of what has been listed on \nher credit reports.  The following debts became delinquent and owing: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to the Government for a student loan that was charged off in \nhe approximate amount of $28,043.  (Government Exhibits 6 and 7.)  Applicant stated \nthat she does not have information from the creditor to verify the amount of the debt. \nApplicant has provided no documentary evidence to show that she has made any\n\n3 \npayment toward resolving the debt or that she is not liable for the debt.  (Response to \nFORM.)  The debt remains outstanding.    \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to the Government for a student loan that was charged off in\nthe approximate amount of $13,167.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  Applicant stated that she\ndoes not have information from the creditor to verify the debt.  Applicant has provided\nno documentary evidence to show that she has made any payment toward resolving the\ndebt or that she is not liable for the debt.  (Response to FORM.)  The debt remains\noutstanding.\n1.c.   Applicant is indebted to a utility company for an account that was placed for\ncollection in the approximate amount of $245.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  Applicant\ninitially denied the debt.  She stated that she had secured a large deposit on the\naccount with creditor that exceeded the amount of the debt the Government claims she\nowed.  She planned to dispute the debt.  On September 20, 2019, Applicant contacted\nthe creditor and agreed to settle the account within 30 days.  (Response to FORM.)\nApplicant has provided no documentary evidence to show that she has made any\npayment toward the debt or that she is not liable for the debt.  The debt remains\noutstanding.\n1.d.  Applicant is indebted to an automotive lender for an account that was charged off\nin the approximate amount of $24,014.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Court records reveal\nthat a judgment was entered against the Applicant on February 18, 2018, in the amount\nof $21,978 plus interest and court costs.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  Applicant stated that\nshe has spoken to the creditor regarding a payment plan, but they were not in\nagreement with terms of repayment.  (Response to FORM.)  Applicant stated that the\ncreditor requested a lump sum in excess of $20,000, which Applicant cannot afford.\nApplicant has provided no documentary evidence to show that she has made any\npayment toward resolving the debt or that she is not liable for the debt.  The debt\nremains outstanding.\n1.e.  Applicant is indebted to an insurance company for an account that was placed for\ncollection in the approximate amount of $103.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Applicant\ndenied the debt, and stated that she has several accounts with this creditor, and would\nnot be permitted to open a new insurance policy if she still owed money to the creditor.\nTo her knowledge this debt has been resolved.  She planned to dispute the debt.  On\nSeptember 20, 2019, Applicant stated that she contacted the creditor and they stated\nthat they have no record of the debt.  (Response to FORM.)  Applicant has provided no\ndocumentary evidence to substantiate her claim.  The debt remains outstanding.\n  Applicant admits that her family\u2019s finances have been challenging.  For the most \npart, although she is married, she has been the primary financial provider for herself \nand her four children for many years.  As a result, she has been unable to afford to pay \nher delinquent debts.  She stated that she has the desire and willingness to pay her \ndelinquent debts, she simply has not had the money to do so.  She states that since \nworking this new job, her compensation has been sufficient to move her through the \nfinancial rebuilding process and that she has made strides to repay her debts.  She has \n\n4 \nfailed to provide any documentation to substantiate what financial rebuilding she has \ndone, or what strides she made to repay her debts.    \nApplicant enjoys her profession as a nurse and is proud to do the work she does.  \nShe states that her performance evaluations from her former and current employers are \nhighly rated and show examples of her leadership.  Applicant stated that her current \ndebt is better controlled than ever before.  She stated that she has fully paid off a \nvehicle loan, and is paying down credit card balances, and has been on time with her \ncurrent open Federal loans.  (Government Exhibit 7.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a trustworthiness position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n\n5 \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:     \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant has a history of financial distress.  She is indebted to various \ncreditors listed in the SOR that include delinquent student loans, a utility bill, a \nvehicle deficiency/repossession, and an insurance bill, which total approximately \n$65,572.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control. \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nIt can be argued that Applicant\u2019s financial problem was largely beyond her \ncontrol, namely a result of her separations from her spouse.  However, Applicant has \nnot shown that she can resolve her debt.  Applicant stated that in her new job, she is \nsufficiently compensated to be able to rebuild her credit.  However, at this time, she \nremains indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR.  Her indebtedness currently \nremains, she has not made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, she has not \nreceived any financial counseling, nor has she provided any evidence to show that she \nhas disputed any of her debts.  She has provided no documentary evidence to show \nthat she has made any payments toward her debts or that she is not liable for the debts.  \nApplicant has done little to nothing to show that she can or will resolve her debts.  She \nrecently contacted several of the creditors in the SOR to set up a payment plan, but that \nnever went anywhere.  Knowing that the Government was concerned about her \nfinancial indebtedness, she did not even pay off the smallest of the debts, a debt for \n$103 that is set forth in 1.e., of the SOR.  It remains owing.  \n \nAs Applicant stated, her priorities over the years have been to support herself \nand her children with food and a roof over their heads.  Although she states that she \nintends to resolve the debts, it is simply too late for this current purpose.   In this case, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  There is no clear evidence in the \nrecord that she has acted reasonably and responsibly.  Her inaction reflects unreliability, \n\n \n7 \n \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. The record fails to establish mitigation of \nfinancial trustworthiness concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(g). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature adult, \nwho has failed to demonstrate that she can live within her means, budget her income \naccordingly, and pay her bills in a timely fashion.  At this point, her financial problems \ncontinue as there is no evidence that they have been resolved or are under control.   \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a public trust position.  She has not met her \nburden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under the guideline for Financial \nConsiderations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a public \ntrust position for the Applicant. \n                             \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on February 11, 2018. On \nJuly 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 12, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 11, \n2019, and the case was assigned to me on September 13, 2019. On the same day, the \n\n \n2 \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for September 27, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant \nwaived the 15-day notice required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8. (Tr. 6.) Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1, 2, and 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. GX 3, an unauthenticated \nsummary of a personal subject interview, was not admitted. (Tr. 13) GX 5, an incident \nreport in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), was admitted in part, in that \nthe reference to a tax lien was admitted but the reference to an alcohol-related incident \nwas not. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) 1 through 6 and 8 through 15, which were admitted without \nobjection. AX 7 was withdrawn as moot after I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to GX 3. \n \n I kept the record open until October 11, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. I extended the deadline after Applicant notified me of \nthe unexpected death of his wife. He timely submitted AX 16 through 18, which were \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 11, 2019. The \nrecord closed on November 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c \nand 1.e. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. His admissions in his answer \nand at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor providing training and \ncertification for Navy sailors. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 1998 \nto August 2018, and retired as a chief petty officer (pay grade E-7).

He has worked for defense contractors since his retirement. \nHe held a security clearance in the Navy and retained it when he began working for \ncontractors. \n \n \nApplicant married in May 2002 and has an adult foster daughter. His wife passed \naway on November 5, 2019, after the hearing. Her passing triggered several changes in \nApplicant\u2019s financial affairs, which were addressed in his post-hearing submission. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts, which are reflected in credit reports from \nJanuary 2018 and June 2019. (GX 2; GX 4.) The evidence concerning these debts is set \nout below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: military credit-card account past due for $39, with a total balance \nof $1,575. Applicant fell behind on his payments after he retired and the bills continued \nto be sent to his old address. He notified the creditor that his address had changed, and \nhe now makes payments by automatic debit. As of September 6, 2019, the account was \ncurrent. (AX 1.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,020. Applicant\u2019s \nwife opened this account, using a power of attorney, while Applicant was deployed in \n2015. The collection agency agreed to settle the debt for $306, which Applicant paid on \nJuly 26, 2019. (AX 2.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account referred for collection of $569. Applicant\u2019s wife \nopened this account during a failed business attempt. The creditor offered to settle the \ndebt for $228. Applicant accepted the offer and paid it on August 1, 2019. (AX 3.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account referred for collection of $448. Applicant \ndisputed this debt, and it was determined by the creditor to be fraudulent. In November \n2018, the creditor asked the three credit-reporting agencies to delete this debt. (AX 4.) \nThe debt is not reflected in the June 2019 credit report. (GX 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: real-estate mortgage loan past due for $32,243, with a balance of \n$165,849. Applicant and his wife purchased a home in 2005, while he was on shore duty. \nHe obtained a VA loan for the entire purchase price of about $151,000. (Tr. 72; GX 2 at \n6.) At the time they bought the house, it was near the Navy training facility for sailors \nholding his rating, and he expected to have multiple assignments nearby and eventually \nlive in the home after he retired. However, his promotion to chief petty officer made him \nineligible for most of the positions at the nearby training facility.  \n \nFrom 2007 to 2017, Applicant was assigned to ships homeported more than 100 \nmiles from his home, and he spent a total of about 13 years at sea. He and his wife tried \nto sell the house in 2008, but they were unsuccessful because of the downturn in the \nhousing market. They were unable to rent the house because it is located in a rural area \nthat is not densely populated. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s wife began suffering from multiple \nmedical problems. She decided to live in the house until 2014, when her health problems \nmade it necessary for her to live closer to her family and medical care. The house was \nvacant until they rented the house in 2016. Applicant lived aboard the ship to which he \nwas assigned, and his wife lived in another state near her family and medical providers. \nThey fell behind on the mortgage-loan payments because of the expense of maintaining \nit along with a separate residence for his wife. At the time of the hearing, Applicant had \nretired, and he and his wife maintained separate households. She lived near her family \nand medical care-givers, and he lived near his current workplace. The house is still rented, \nbut it is 80 years old and requires extensive maintenance and repairs. (Tr. 49-55.) The \ntenants pay rent of $700, but the mortgage-loan payment is $944. (GX 2 at 6; Tr. 49-55, \n78.)  \n \nApplicant has never sought or obtained financial counseling. (Tr. 86.) However, in \nJuly 2019, Applicant contacted a realtor specializing in assistance to veterans with VA \nloans. (AX 5.) The realtor is assisting him in seeking approval for a short sale of the home. \n(AX 12) The realtor testified that it probably will take 60-90 days to obtain approval from \nthe lender for a short sale. (Tr. 24.) On November 15, Applicant was contacted by a listing \nrealtor, who is anxious to sell the house. (AX 17.) As of the date the record closed, the \ndelinquent mortgage loan was not resolved.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: medical bill referred for collection of $365. This debt was charged \noff in 2013. Applicant contacted the collection agency and was informed that it does not \nhave an open account for it.  \n \n \nThe passing of Applicant\u2019s wife significantly changed his financial situation. He is \nthe beneficiary of a $50,000 life insurance policy. His retired pay will increase because \nthe monthly deduction of $148 for the Survivor Benefit Plan has terminated. He plans to \nuse the insurance money to pay his wife\u2019s funeral expenses, outstanding medical bills, \nand several debts, leaving a balance of about $29,000, which he will use to either fix up \nthe house for sale or resolve the past-due payments. He estimates that his net monthly \nremainder after all debt payments and monthly expenses will increase from $926 to \n$3,667. (AX 16; AX 18.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager, a retired Navy captain, has daily contact with him and \nregards him as reliable and trustworthy, notwithstanding his delinquent mortgage \npayments. (AX 9.) Applicant\u2019s team leader, also a retired Navy officer, considers him \ntrustworthy and honest. (AX 10.) One of Applicant\u2019s co-workers, a retired senior chief \npetty officer, who works daily with Applicant and travels with him frequently, has observed \nthat Applicant is meticulous about safeguarding the large amount of classified information \nrequired for their job. He considers Applicant trustworthy, committed, and loyal. (AX 11.) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n5 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n\n \n6 \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing establish the \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. The illness and \nultimate death of Applicant\u2019s wife were unusual circumstances, but the delinquent debts \nhad already been incurred when she became too ill to live in the home with the delinquent \nmortgage loan. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant encountered numerous conditions that were \nlargely beyond his control: the downtown of the housing market in 2008, his numerous \nassignments to sea duty and shore assignments geographically distant from the family \nhome, his wife\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to establish and operate a business, a fraudulent \ncredit-card account, and his wife\u2019s illness and eventual demise. He has acted responsibly \nby resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, successfully challenging the fraudulent \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, making multiple efforts to resolve the delinquent mortgage \nloan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and contacting the collection agency for the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant resolved the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, and he made reasonable efforts to resolve the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n\n \n1.f. The delinquent mortgage loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e is not yet resolved. However, a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. \nJun. 21, 2010.) The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has taken significant \nactions to implement his plan to resolve the delinquent mortgage loan. He has obtained \nprofessional advice, initiated the process for a short sale, and listed the home for sale. \nHe has a fall-back plan to use the insurance proceeds from his wife\u2019s death if necessary. \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which \nApplicant disputed. The debt was determined to be fraudulent, and it has been removed \nfrom his credit record. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. He has served honorably in the U.S. Navy and held a security \nclearance for more than 20 years. I am confident that he will continue to demonstrate the \nreliability and trustworthiness he demonstrated on active duty and as an employee of a \ndefense contractor. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old, divorced, and has one child. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and an associate\u2019s degree with high honors. He is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment with a defense contractor as a linguist. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 89-90.) 3 Paragraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) Applicant lived in Iraq until 2007, when he moved to Syria for a better life. He next moved to Lebanon, where he applied for refugee status to the United States. Refugee status was granted and the Applicant moved to the United States in 2009. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant worked in private industry outside the defense field until 2017, when he began work with his current employer. He hoped to receive a security clearance, which would result in a promotion at work, allowing him to be of more assistance to the troops he is supporting, and put him in a better financial position in the United States. As of the date of the hearing he had been living in two overseas locations for over a year, assisting American military units acting as trainers for foreign military members.

His request for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on October 24, 2017. (Government Exhibit 1.) On June 24, 2019, the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n\n \n2 \n \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position, effective within the Department of Defense on or after June 8, \n2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 20, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nAugust 26, 2019. The case was assigned to me on August 27, 2019. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 28, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for September 18, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were \nadmitted without objection. The Government also submitted Hearing Exhibit I for \nAdministrative Notice. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant \nExhibits A through D, which were also admitted without objection. Applicant requested \nthat the record remain open for receipt of additional documentation. Applicant Exhibits E \nthrough H were received in a timely manner and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 27, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq). Department Counsel provided a \nseven-page summary of the facts, supported by eleven Government documents \npertaining to Iraq, identified as Hearing Exhibit I. The documents provide elaboration \nand context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts included in the \nU.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject \nto reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. (Tr. 12-13.) \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old, divorced, and has one child. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, and an associate\u2019s degree with high honors. He is applying for national security \neligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment with a defense \ncontractor as a linguist. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Applicant \nExhibit D; Tr. 89-90.) \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nApplicant lived in Iraq until 2007, when he moved to Syria for a better life. He \nnext moved to Lebanon, where he applied for refugee status to the United States. \nRefugee status was granted and the Applicant moved to the United States in 2009. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) \n   \n \nApplicant worked in private industry outside the defense field until 2017, when he \nbegan work with his current employer. He hoped to receive a security clearance, which \nwould result in a promotion at work, allowing him to be of more assistance to the troops \nhe is supporting, and put him in a better financial position in the United States. As of the \ndate of the hearing he had been living in two overseas locations for over a year, \nassisting American military units acting as trainers for foreign military members. \n(Government Exhibits 1 at Section 13A, 2, and 3; Tr. 8-9, 44-47, 85, 108.) \n \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized American citizen on June 18, 2014. Applicant \nrenounced his Iraqi citizenship when he became an American citizen. He has no Iraqi \nidentification of any type. Applicant has no financial contacts with Iraq. His savings are \nin the United States, and his financial situation is stable. (Government Exhibit 1 at \nSections 9 and 10; Tr.79, 92-94, 97-98, 103-112.) \n \n \nApplicant married his first cousin in 2004. It was an arranged marriage. They \nseparated after six months. Applicant\u2019s daughter was born in 2005. Applicant did not \nsee or talk to his wife or daughter from 2005 until 2015. In 2015, before he began work \nas a linguist, Applicant visited Iraq using his American passport and attempted a \nreconciliation with his wife. It was unsuccessful. After being separated for many years, \nApplicant has legally divorced his wife in accordance with Iraqi law, as shown by legal \ndocuments in the record. He provides about $300 every two or three months in support \nfor his minor daughter. He has very little communication with his daughter, and none \nwith his now ex-wife. He has no plans to move his daughter to the United States. \n(Government Exhibit 3 at 10; Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 59-74, 77-78, 80-83, 95, 103.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives in Iraq. He also has a brother and two sisters. His \nmother has dementia. Applicant has occasional telephonic contact with his mother and \nsiblings. He sends his mother about $300 every two or three months in support. \nApplicant\u2019s mother lived in the United States with Applicant in 2012-2013, but returned \nto Iraq. He has no plans to sponsor his mother or siblings for emigration to the United \nStates. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10; Tr. 74-77, 84, 92, 94-97.) \n \n \nApplicant \nfilled \nout \na \ncounterintelligence-focused \nsecurity \nscreening \nquestionnaire in 2017. (Government Exhibit 3.) He was also interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management in 2017 and 2018. (Government \nExhibit 2.) The information provided by Applicant during these occasions was consistent \nwith his testimony during the hearing. \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nMitigation \n \n \nApplicant is proud to be an American citizen, and to have assisted the U.S. \nmilitary in overseas locations. He feels no sense of loyalty to Iraq, stating that he views \nhimself as \u201cAmerican-American,\u201d as opposed to an Iraqi- or Arab-American. He has \ngone on many missions with the US military, transporting sensitive material from one \nbase to another in foreign locations. He was proud to be involved in such missions, \nwhich he expressed at the time to the soldiers he was working with. (Tr. 50, 91-92, 105-\n106.) \n \n \nApplicant was a highly respected and successful linguist while working in the \noverseas locations. This is shown by letters of appreciation and certificates of \nachievement presented to him with regard to his work during the period from 2018 \nthrough 2019. He was described as a linguist of \u201cunique value,\u201d helping secure the \n\u201csafety and security\u201d of American forces during operations. Applicant has a sense of \nallegiance to the soldiers and civilians he worked with. Several of the letters describe in \ndetail how Applicant\u2019s conduct was above the average for linguists. He has been \nrecommended for a civilian service award by the unit he is currently supporting. \n(Applicant Exhibits A, B, C, F, G, and H; Tr. 86-88.) \n \n \nOne of the soldiers Applicant worked with, an Army National Guard sergeant, \ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has a security clearance. Applicant and the witness \nworked together for eight months at an overseas location and have become friends. He \nworked often with Applicant and described in detail the reasons Applicant was the most \ntrusted linguist within his unit. Applicant was diligent, always willing to do the most \ndifficult missions, and would never talk about what he did when off the job. Applicant \ndirectly expressed to the witness his pride in being involved in sensitive and potentially \ndangerous missions. (Tr. 18-45.) \n \n \nApplicant is very aware of his responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance, \nparticularly if advances are made toward him or his relatives. He is knowledgeable of \nhis security responsibilities, and is more than willing to fulfill them. (Tr. 98-102.) \n \nIraq \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Hearing Exhibit I: \nAttachments.) \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to \nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks national security eligibility enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother, brother, sisters, and daughter live in Iraq. Applicant is \ndivorced from his now ex-wife. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \nIraq has significant internal anti-western terrorism threats that operate openly and \ncontrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s family connections in that country \nhave the potential to generate a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion under AG \u00b6 7(a). The mere possession of close \nfamily ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).) \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has minimal contact with his family members who live in Iraq. He is a \nproud American citizen, and he has succeeded in this country on his own, without help \nfrom anyone. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), and (c) apply. \n \nApplicant is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and evinced a \ncredible intent to rebuff any attempts by foreign actors to improperly influence him. AG \u00b6 \n8(e) applies. \n \nApplicant was involved in transporting sensitive, important, and dangerous cargo \nseveral times in overseas locations. The soldiers he worked with, including one who \ntestified at his hearing, all indicate that Applicant did his job without any indication that \nhe had breached security policies or procedures. While that fact is not normally to be \nconsidered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. \n05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) the following: \n \n\n \n8 \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s \nprior history of complying with security procedures and regulations \nsignificant probative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or \nextenuating the security concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more \nimmediate disqualifying conduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 01-03357 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at \n5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2006). However, the Board has recognized an exception to that \ngeneral rule in Guideline B cases, where the applicant has established by \ncredible, independent evidence that his compliance with security \nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk \ncircumstances in which the applicant had made a significant contribution \nto the national security. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 14, 2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to \nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nI have carefully considered the fact that Applicant\u2019s family lives in Iraq, \nparticularly his daughter. In this particular case, I find that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity significance arising from their presence for the following reasons. Applicant has \nbeen subject to considerable screening for his various jobs. He consistently has \nidentified his family members in Iraq. He has served U.S. national interests with pride \nand exceptional ability during his time overseas. Applicant has completely mitigated the \nsecurity significance of the presence of his family members in Iraq. Paragraph 1 is \nfound for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(b), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the pertinent guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born and raised in Iraq. Since 2009 he has lived full time in the \nUnited States, working and attended school in order to advance himself. He has visited \nIraq once since coming to the United States as a refugee. Applicant has shown himself \nto be a talented and patriotic American citizen and member of the defense industry. He \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States due to \nhis sense of loyalty to the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nWilford H. Ross \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for security clearance access is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn February 21 , 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP, Item 3) requesting security clearance eligibility so that \nshe could work for a defense contractor. On March 6, 2018, she provided an interview \n(Item 7) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) could not make the necessary affirmative findings to grant \n1 \n\n    \n  \n \nor continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance, and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on \nJune 8, 2019 detailing security reasons under the financial considerations guideline \n(Guideline F).

Applicant did not object, and the exhibit was \nadmitted into evidence. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52. \nOn October 28, 2019, I reopened the record to allow Applicant an opportunity to \nsubmit additional evidence based on her assertions that she had plans in place to begin \npaying the three listed creditors twice a month. I recommended that she include \ndocumentation establishing that she had \u201csettled numerous other debts,\u201d and she would \nhave a student loan satisfied in the middle of October 2019.

These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration.

Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, \nsubstance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as \nit may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nManaging one\u2019s finances is generally a private matter between a debtor and her \ncreditors.

Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a nonprofit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has only limited application because the delinquent debts total over \n$24,000 and are less than four years old. Applicant has known about the debts since she \nsubmitted her e-QIP in February 2018. She took no documented action to address the \ndebt until October 4, 2019. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) recognizes that a person\u2019s financial problems may be caused by \nconditions beyond their control. Applicant experienced marital problems as she was \nseparated three times before she received her divorce in January 2015. Because of the \ncontentious divorce litigation, subsequent alimony and child support issues, she had to \nturn to her credit cards to pay attorney fees, living expenses, and her children\u2019s clothing. \nIn September 2018, she lost her car and a large amount of her household property \nbecause of a hurricane. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \n5 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \u201cacting responsibly under the circumstances\u201d \nmust be given some consideration based on Applicant\u2019s March 2019 credit bureau report \nshowing the three SOR creditors as the only delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever had financial counseling. However, \nshe does have a budget and a plan to repay the debt with the help of her husband. Based \non A2R, there are growing indicators that Applicant is reestablishing control over her \nfinances. Given the documented payments she has made to resolve the debts, she is \nentitled to some mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access \nto classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s third separation occurred in January 2013. She received her divorce in \nJanuary 2015. Unfortunately, she had to abuse credit cards after the divorce to pay \nattorney fees, living expenses, and her children\u2019s necessities because her former \nhusband was not honoring the alimony and child support obligations under the decree. \nBetween August and November 2016, the three listed accounts became delinquent. \nThough Applicant took no documented action to address the listed indebtedness \nin 2018, she produced credible documentation in October and November 2019 that she \nis taking action to pay off the delinquencies. Based on the encouraging status of \nApplicant\u2019s March 2019 credit bureau report showing only the three listed creditors as \ndelinquent, and her budgetary plan to satisfy the remaining debt, Applicant has overcome \nthe security concerns arising from the guideline for financial considerations. \n6 \n\n    \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:    \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT   \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n \n  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n                 ___________ \n  \n  \n \n \nConclusion  \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Dorsey, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/26/2019\nDecision \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2018, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For National Security Positions (SF 86). On June 26, 2019, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated August 19, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR, \nand he elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item \n2) A complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on September 10, \n2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, \nApplicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines \napplicable to his case. He received the FORM on September 18, 2019. His response was \ndue on October 18, 2019. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of \nNovember 21, 2019, no response had been received.  The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 21, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.). Applicant\u2019s \ncomments are incorporated herein as potential findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a software engineer with his current employer since April 2018. He has also held a \npart-time position as a site manager from October 2016 until at least May 2018 where \nchildren were taught music and arts using technology. He initially enlisted in the Army \nReserve in March 2002; was commissioned in May 2007; and continued serving until July \n2016, when he was honorably discharged. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007 and \na master\u2019s degree in 2011. (Item 3) He was granted a secret clearance in 2007. (Item 7) \nHe was married in 2010. He has two children, born in 2012 and 2017.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \nEquifax Credit Report, dated May 30, 2018); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated May \n31, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated January 16, 2019); Item 2 (SF 86, \ndated May 4, 2018); and Item 2 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated August 19, 2019).  \nIn his SF 86, Applicant listed one defaulted student loan, in the amount of $8,500, \nand he claimed that he was working to consolidate over $31,500 in student loans. He \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nnoted that his student loans \u201cbacked up\u201d when he was out of work. (Item 3, at 38-39) \nApplicant left some jobs when the contracts on which he was working expired, and he left \nanother position because the commute was too far. He continued to take classes \nregardless of his employment situation. During his interview with an investigator from the \nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2019, Applicant reported that he \nwas unemployed from October 2016 until April 2017, and from June 2017 until November \n2017, but that information differs from what he reported in his SF 86. (Item 4, at 27-28; \nItem 3, at 13) He also acknowledged that his student loan financial issues started in 2011 \nor 2012 when he failed to realize that student loans had to be paid starting upon \ngraduation. (Item 4, at 6) He did not indicate whether he ever sought deferment or \nforbearance of his student loans. He reported that his federal income tax refunds for the \ntax years 2016 through 2018 were applied towards his delinquent student loans. (Item 4, \nat 6) He stated that he had contacted his loan lenders and loan servicing agents to set up \nrepayment agreements, but he was unable to comply with those agreements when he \nbecame unemployed. (Item 4)  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant contended that from 2016 until 2018, he did \nnot have a job, and claimed that during that period, his then-pregnant wife broke her leg \nand he became her 24/7 caretaker. (Item 2, at 3) It should be noted that his wife gave \nbirth in October 2017. (Item 3, at 26) Applicant failed to submit any documents such as \nstatements from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting the attachment of income \ntax refunds; statements from the creditors agreeing to a repayment plan; cancelled \nchecks, copies of money orders, a bank register, or receipts, to indicate that any tax \nattachments has taken place, agreements had been made with creditors, or that any \npayments had been made to any creditor. \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$74,915. Those allegations are set forth as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a.: a loan with a high credit \nof $16,347 and past-due and unpaid balance of $23,478 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 8); SOR \n\u00b6 1.b.: a loan with a high credit of $18,994 and past-due and unpaid balance of $18,394 \n(Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 8); SOR \u00b6 1.c.: a loan with a high credit of $3,038 and past-due \nand unpaid balance of $4,363 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 8); SOR \u00b6 1.d.: a loan with a high \ncredit of $5,403 and past-due and unpaid balance of $4,009 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 7); a \nloan with a high credit of $5,403 and past-due and unpaid balance of $3,821 (Item 6, at \n2; Item 5, at 6); SOR \u00b6 1.e.: a loan with a high credit of $5,403 and past-due and unpaid \nbalance of $3,821 (Item 6, at 2; Item 5, at 6); SOR \u00b6 1.f.: a loan with an unpaid balance \nof $8,540 (Item 5, at 9); and SOR \u00b6 1.h.: a loan with an unpaid balance of $8,528 (Item \n5, at 9) All but the last two accounts were placed for collection, and the remaining \naccounts were assigned to the government. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant cryptically referred to \u201cFFEL,\u201d listed various \ndollar numbers and percentage rates, and stated that one account with an unpaid balance \nof $18,394 \u201cseems to be a duplicate account,\u201d but failed to identify the claimed duplicate \naccount, and identified one account with an unpaid balance of $8,528 as a duplicate \naccount, but once again failed to identify the claimed duplicate account. (Item 2, at 1-2, \n4) In the absence of further commentary and explanation by Applicant, his notes are of \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nvery little value. FFEL stands for the Federal Family Education Loan Program, a system \nof private student loans which were subsidized and guaranteed by the United States \nfederal government. The program issued loans from 1965 until it was ended in 2010. The \nonly difference between the loans is that one was issued by a financial institution and the \nother was issued by the government itself. FFEL loans were also insured by guaranty \nagencies. (https://www2ed.gov/programs/ffel) \nIt is not known what Applicant\u2019s current financial resources may be because he did \nnot report his current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder \nthat might be available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a \nbudget. There is no evidence of financial counseling. In the absence of additional financial \ninformation, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been.  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has eight delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$74,915. He claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in current \nstatus. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that \nApplicant has been unwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \n\u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \ndifficulties, and his failure to voluntarily and timely resolve his delinquent student-loan \naccounts for several years, make it rather easy to conclude that it was not infrequent and \nit is likely to remain unchanged, much like it has been for several years. Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment, but the record is unclear as \nwhat those actual periods were, or whether he sought deferment or forbearance of his \nstudent loans.  \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). Applicant \ncompleted his SF 86 in May 2018; underwent his OPM interview in January 2019; the \nSOR was issued in June 2019; and he received the FORM in September 2019. Each step \nof the security clearance review process placed him on notice of the significance of the \nfinancial issues confronting him. While he contends the IRS applied some income tax \nrefunds to his delinquent accounts, and he claims to have attempted to consolidate his \ndelinquent student-loan accounts, he failed to submit any documents such as statements \nfrom the IRS reflecting the attachment of income tax refunds; statements from the \ncreditors agreeing to a repayment plan; cancelled checks, copies of money orders, a bank \nregister, or receipts, to indicate that any tax attachments has taken place, agreements \nhad been made with creditors, or that any payments had been made to any creditor. \nAlthough Applicant had the opportunity to fully explain the present status of his situation, \nespecially when Department Counsel noted in the FORM that he had provided no \ndocuments to corroborate the claims he made in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant simply \nignored that comment and he essentially failed to address those concerns. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.  \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is no evidence supported by documentation that \nApplicant has taken any corrective actions with respect to his delinquent student-loan \ndebts. There are brief unverified comments by Applicant that he took some initial steps to \nconsolidate his delinquent student loans, but he offered no documentation to support his \ncontentions. His contentions regarding the status of his accounts, and his unverified \ncomments claiming that he had taken certain actions, without documents, to support his \nclaims, are insufficient to reflect good-faith actions. The Appeal Board has previously \nexplained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001). \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling or a budget. In the absence of \nadditional financial information, it remains difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in \na better position financially than he had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n  \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial concerns. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nsoftware engineer with his current employer since April 2018. He has also held a part-\ntime position as a site manager from October 2016 until at least May 2018 where children \nwere taught music and arts using technology. He initially enlisted in the Army Reserve in \nMarch 2002; was commissioned in May 2007; and continued serving until July 2016, \nwhen he was honorably discharged. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2011. He was granted a secret clearance in 2007. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant has eight delinquent student-loan accounts totaling approximately \n$74,915. He claimed that he had insufficient funds to maintain his accounts in a current \nstatus because he was unemployed for certain periods. He contended that the IRS \nattached income tax refunds and applied them towards some of his loans, and that he \nhad started addressing the accounts by consolidating them. He failed to submit any \ndocuments to indicate that any tax refund attachments has taken place, agreements had \nbeen made with creditors, or that any payments had been made to any creditor. Although \nApplicant had the opportunity to fully explain the present status of his situation, especially \nwhen Department Counsel noted in the FORM that he had provided no documents to \ncorroborate the claims he made in his Answer to the SOR, Applicant simply ignored that \ncomment and he essentially failed to address those concerns. In the absence of further \nexplanations and documents, it is difficult to assess the true situation, for we have only \nApplicant\u2019s unverified comments claiming that he had taken certain actions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n \nWhile Applicant contended that he took certain actions with respect to his \ndelinquent student-loan accounts, there is no documentary evidence to indicate that any \nof those accounts have been addressed. Applicant\u2019s current track record is poor at best. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.h.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He submitted numerous documents and letters \nattesting to his strong moral character and excellent performance of duties in the \nmilitary. He is praised for his trustworthiness, honor, professionalism, dedication, \nhonesty, dependability, reliability, work ethic, leadership, patriotism, and integrity. (Tr. at \n22, 35; AE C, G, I) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n4 \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant did not file his 2013 through 2018 federal and state income tax returns \nwhen they were due. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \ncondition.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nI found Applicant to be honest and truthful, but lax about his legal requirement to \nfile his tax returns. His failure to file his tax returns when required raises some questions \nabout his judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. It took some \neffort, but all the returns are filed. His returns indicated that he was due refunds for each \nyear. He will likely forfeit thousands of dollars in refunds because some of the returns \nwere filed beyond the statute of limitations on refunds. He also realizes that his neglect \ncould have an adverse effect on his security clearance, as well as his civilian \nemployment and military service. I am satisfied that Applicant\u2019s tax issues will not be \nrepeated. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable. See additional discussion below under the Whole-\nPerson Concept.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax returns are filed, but that does not end the discussion. An \napplicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline \nto follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his or \nher own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03187 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018). \nThe differentiator in this case is Applicant\u2019s military service and particularly his \ndeployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. That has earned him some additional good will. \nHe has learned a valuable and costly lesson. I am convinced all future returns will be \nfiled on time. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 23, 2019 (Answer), and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 5, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non September 5, 2019, scheduling the hearing for September 11, 2019. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record \nwas left open until September 25, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation. \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant presented six documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and \nB.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on October 24, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR with explanations.

Applicant is indebted to Creditor A, a landlord, in the amount of about \n$10,101. He is addressing this debt through a debt consolidation service; and as such, \nthis allegation is found for Applicant. (TR at page 18 line 17 to page 22 line 11, and  \nAnswer at pages v and vi.) \n \n \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to Creditor B, for a business loan, in the amount of \nabout $10,026.

He has offered nothing further in this regard; and \nas such, this allegation is also found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant is indebted to Creditor D, a credit union, in the amount of about \n$5,508. He is addressing this debt through a debt consolidation service; and as such, \nthis allegation is also found for Applicant. (TR at page 25 line 24 to page 26 line 17, and \nAnswer at page v.) \n \n \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to Creditor E, a bank, in the amount of about $4,794. \nHe is addressing this debt through a debt consolidation service; and as such, this \nallegation is also found for Applicant. (TR at page 26 line 18 to page 27 line 8, and \nAnswer at page v.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant is also indebted to Creditor D, the same credit union as noted in \n1.d., above, in the amount of about $2,892. He is addressing this debt through a debt \nconsolidation service; and as such, this allegation is also found for Applicant.

He has paid this debt as evidenced by correspondence from this creditor; \nand as such, this allegation is found for Applicant. (TR at page 28 lines 4~13, and AppX \nA at page 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is well respected both by a former military member, and by a work \ncolleague. (AppX B.) \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAlthough Applicant has addressed much of his past-due indebtedness, his \nfinancial problems are ongoing as he has yet to address two past-due debts totaling \nover $20,000. He has a long history of delinquencies. Applicant has not demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been \nestablished. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nrespected by those who know him. He performs well at his job.  \n \nHowever, overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c.: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d. through 1.g.: For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 1, 2017. \nOn July 17, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 20, 2019 (Ans.), and requested a decision \nbased on the administrative record, without a hearing. The Government\u2019s written brief \nwith supporting documents, known as the File of Relevant Material (FORM), was \nsubmitted by Department Counsel on September 12, 2019. A complete copy of the FORM \n\n \n2 \n \nwas provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, rebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM \nand submitted a reply, dated November 2, 2019. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 11, 2019. Applicant did not object to any matters contained in the record. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D are \nadmitted into evidence without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old program analyst, employed by a government contractor \nsince November 2017. He was unemployed from September to November 2017. He \nearned a general educational development (GED) certification in 2006, and completed \nsome technical college studies. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2008 until \n2014, and deployed to Iraq. He was honorably discharged in November 2014. He married \nin 2007 and has three children. Applicant\u2019s last DOD security clearance was a secret \nclearance granted in 2007. \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on six debts \ntotaling over $26,000. These consumer debts were either charged off or in a collection \nstatus. The four largest debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d) were discussed during Applicant\u2019s \npersonal subject interview with a government investigator. Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations and provided some explanations. He noted that it was challenging to find work \nafter leaving active duty and difficult to earn enough income to support his family. His wife \nworked to supplement the family income, but difficult work schedules caused a strain in \ntheir relationship. They did not legally separate or divorce, but they had a physical \nseparation of unknown length. They eventually reconciled their differences and remained \ntogether. (Ans.) Applicant was hired as a defense contractor in November 2017, and \nworked in one state while maintaining his family in another state. In 2018, his \nunanticipated expenses for the final family move to a third state totaled approximately \n$8,000. (AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a vehicle loan that has been charged off for $13,127. The account \nwas listed in Applicant\u2019s SCA. Applicant voluntarily relinquished the vehicle in 2015 (GE \n4), and the account was charged off in May 2016. (GE 5) Applicant was unable to provide \nspecific details of the account during his personal subject interview, but claimed the \naccount was delinquent due to his separation from his spouse. (GE 4) The record contains \nno evidence of efforts to resolve this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a vehicle loan that has been charged off for $5,125. Applicant listed \nthe debt in his SCA, stating that the account became delinquent in 2015 due to marital \nhardships and the separation from his spouse. The account was charged off in March \n2016. (GE 5) Applicant was unable to provide specific details of the account during his \npersonal subject interview, but noted his intent to arrange to pay the debt. The record \ncontains no evidence of efforts to resolve this debt. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a personal loan that became delinquent for $4,593 in about February \n2017, and charged off in August 2017. The account was not listed in Applicant\u2019s SCA. He \nwas unable to provide specific details of the account during his personal subject interview, \nbut he noted his intent to arrange to pay the debt. The record contains no evidence of \nefforts to resolve this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a $2,570 credit card account that became delinquent in about October \n2015, and referred to collections. The account was not listed in Applicant\u2019s SCA. He was \nunable to provide specific details of the account during his personal subject interview. In \nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he submitted an October 2019 settlement with the \ncreditor, showing his agreement to pay $105 in monthly installments from November 2019 \nto October 2020, totaling $1,260. (AE C) No evidence of any payments toward this plan \nwas submitted. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a $690 credit card debt from 2015, currently in collections. The \naccount was not listed in Applicant\u2019s SCA. In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he \nsubmitted a final payment receipt from August 2019, showing the account was settled \nwith a zero balance. (AE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a $71 utility company debt from 2017, currently in collections. The \naccount was not listed in Applicant\u2019s SCA. Applicant submitted a \u201cpaid in full\u201d receipt from \nAugust 2019, showing the account was settled with a zero balance. (AE B) \n \nThe record does not contain evidence of Applicant\u2019s current financial status, \nincome and expenses statement, or financial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n4 \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good- faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \n\n \n6 \n \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies, partially due to his transition from \nactive duty, a short period of unemployment, underemployment, a marital separation, and \nmaintaining two households. He found it difficult to find work and earn enough income to \nsupport his family. His wife worked to supplement the family income, but difficult work \nschedules caused a strain in their relationship.  \n \nApplicant did not address his debts in a timely manner even though they were \nincluded in his 2018 personal subject interview. After the SOR was issued and the FORM \nwas submitted, he contacted three creditors and paid the two smallest debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.f) The third creditor agreed to accept payments in an installment plan, but \nApplicant did not show evidence of good-faith payments toward the plan. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) A \nfuture promise to pay, without additional concomitant action to show good-faith efforts to \nresolve the debt, is not sufficient to mitigate the SOR allegation. The remaining SOR \ndebts, which include the largest, were not resolved, and no information regarding good-\nfaith efforts to resolve them was provided. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c) Finally, no evidence of \nfinancial counseling or Applicant\u2019s current financial status was submitted. I have \ninsufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control and are unlikely \nto recur. \n \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s history of unresolved debts and failure to show his current \nfinancial condition raise significant doubts about his ability or intent to satisfy his largest \ndelinquent debts, and ability to maintain a satisfactory financial status. I am not convinced \nApplicant makes good financial decisions, and his financial status continues to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Although some of \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems may have resulted from unusual or unforeseen events and \nemployment irregularities, there is little evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and that future delinquencies are unlikely to recur. Applicant made some \nlate efforts to resolve two small debts and promised to pay another in installments, but \nthe largest SOR debts remain unresolved, and insufficient evidence was submitted to \nshow efforts to resolve them. No mitigation conditions fully apply, except that AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies to the resolved debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \n\n \n7 \n \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s personal circumstances, financial challenges, and military service. However, \nApplicant did not sufficiently address the largest SOR debts and did not provide sufficient \nevidence of financial responsibility. \n \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s security clearance is denied. \n \n \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted the financial allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, claiming that she had paid both accounts. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 38-year-old registered nurse. She completed her bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2004. She married in 2011, and has two children ages 12 and 2, and five step- children between ages 24 and 19. Applicant\u2019s employment history shows that she was employed as a nurse in different hospitals between 2004 and October 2018. She was hired by her current employer, a federal contractor and her position of trust sponsor, in October 2018, and has been working as a telehealth nurse to present. This is Applicant\u2019s first position of trust application. In response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed she had financial problems caused by a fifty percent reduction in pay. She voluntarily resigned from a well-paid position in 2013, and moved to another state to take care of her ailing mother. Additionally, she was unemployed or underemployed during five months in 2016 due to a disabling leg injury, and one month underemployed because of pregnancy complications. She delivered a child in 2017 and was out of work for about four months on maternity leave. In her SCA, Applicant promised to establish payment arrangements with her credi",

She failed to mitigate the Guideline F \n(financial considerations) trustworthiness concerns. Eligibility to hold a position of trust \nis denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an application for a position of trust (Application) on October \n4, 2018. She was interviewed by a government investigator on March 7, 2019. After \nreviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the Department \nof Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 31, 2018, \nalleging trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 28, 2019, and requested a decision based on \nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. \nA copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), containing the \nevidence supporting the trustworthiness concerns, was provided to Applicant by letter \ndated September 20, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on October 2, 2019. She was \n\n \n2 \n \n \ngranted a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM to submit any objections to the \nFORM and to provide material to refute, extenuate, and mitigate the concerns. \nApplicant timely responded to the FORM with a three-page submission, which included \na one-page response, a notice of termination of owner beneficiary rights regarding an \naccount, and a reference letter. Her response and the two documents were made part \nof the record. The case was assigned to me on October 28, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that the FORM included an \nunauthenticated summary of interview with a government background investigator on \nMarch 7, 2019. (FORM, Item 5) Applicant was informed she could object to the \nsummary of her interview, and it would not be admitted or considered, or that she could \nmake corrections, additions, deletions, and update the document to make it accurate. \nApplicant was informed that her failure to respond to the FORM or to raise any \nobjections could be construed as a waiver and the proposed FORM evidence would be \nconsidered. I admitted the FORM\u2019s proffered evidence and considered it. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted the financial allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.d. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, claiming that she had paid both accounts. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old registered nurse. She completed her bachelor\u2019s degree \nin May 2004. She married in 2011, and has two children ages 12 and 2, and five step-\nchildren between ages 24 and 19.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that she was employed as a nurse in \ndifferent hospitals between 2004 and October 2018. She was hired by her current \nemployer, a federal contractor and her position of trust sponsor, in October 2018, and \nhas been working as a telehealth nurse to present. This is Applicant\u2019s first position of \ntrust application.  \n \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of her 2018 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed she had financial problems caused by a fifty percent reduction in pay. She \nvoluntarily resigned from a well-paid position in 2013, and moved to another state to \ntake care of her ailing mother. Additionally, she was unemployed or underemployed \nduring five months in 2016 due to a disabling leg injury, and one month underemployed \nbecause of pregnancy complications. She delivered a child in 2017 and was out of work \nfor about four months on maternity leave. In her SCA, Applicant promised to establish \npayment arrangements with her creditors as soon as possible. \n \nDuring her 2019 interview with a government investigator, Applicant was \nquestioned about the accounts alleged in the SOR. She explained that her 2013 fifty \n\n \n3 \n \n \npercent reduction in pay and her periods of unemployment and low earnings prevented \nher from paying her debts. Applicant stated that she was unable to pay the SOR \ndelinquent accounts because she has been trying to recover financially from her income \ndecrease and unemployment-underemployment periods. She claimed that she intends \nto pay her delinquent accounts by establishing payment plans with her creditors during \n2019. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a delinquent auto loan account for $40,000 that she made in \nearly 2012. Applicant averred that she made timely payments on the loan until February \n2013, when she could no longer afford to make the payments and returned the car. The \ncar was sold, and she has a remnant debt of about $10,000. She has not made any \nadditional payments on the loan. The last collection efforts by the collection agency \nwere made in 2017. Applicant stated that she is not sure whether she wants to pay the \naccount because it is not listed as open in her credit report.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged a delinquent credit-card account. Applicant opened the \naccount in 2011-2012 allegedly to build up her credit. The account had a limit of $1,000. \nApplicant charged the account and her minimum payment was $15. When she moved \nto another state, her income was reduced and she stopped making payments. She did \nnot pay her delinquent charges. Applicant stated that according to her credit report the \naccount was closed. Thus, she does not intend to make any payments on his debt \nunless the creditor demands repayment. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleged a delinquent auto loan. Applicant purchased the car with her \nhusband as a co-signer in early 2013 for $23,000. She averred they made timely \npayments on the loan until March 2017, when she could no longer afford to make the \npayments and returned the car to the creditor. She has not made any additional \npayments on the loan. Applicant claimed she attempted to contact the creditor in \nOctober 2018 to set up a payment plan, but was unsuccessful. Because the creditor did \nnot return her calls, Applicant is now disputing the debt. She claimed that she would like \nto set up a payment plan \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant explained that this was an account for \ntelephone services that she opened when she was 28 (2009). She claimed she always \npaid her bill on time until January 2016, when she had to stop making payments \nbecause the reduction of her income. She presented no evidence of any payments \nmade or of efforts to contact the creditor to resolve this account. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleged a delinquent internet-cable-phone services account. Applicant \nclaimed she made payments on the account until January 2017. She stopped making \npayments because she could no longer afford the payments. Applicant promised the \ninterviewer that she would contact the company and pay the debt. With her SOR \nanswer, Applicant submitted an extract from CreditKarma.com, showing that the \naccounts has a $0 balance. I find this account for Applicant. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged a $378 delinquent medical-services account. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that she believed it was part of her child-delivery charges. She promised to \ncontact the company and pay the debt. With her SOR answer, Applicant submitted an \nextract from CreditKarma.com, showing that she paid a law office (presumably \ncollecting for the account holder) a balance of $378. I find this account for Applicant. \n \nExcept for the two Credit Karma documents indicating that the accounts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1f had a $0 balance, Applicant presented no documentary evidence \nof any contacts with creditors, payments made, or payment agreements established \nconcerning any of the SOR debts. She promised to address the SOR debts sometime in \nthe near future.  \n \nApplicant claimed that her current financial situation is better because she now \nhas a higher paying job. She claimed that her money is spent in \u201cmaintaining and \npaying off debt.\u201d She averred that she is meeting her current financial obligations, and \nthat she has no intention to acquire any additional delinquent debts. \n \nApplicant believes that she has been financially responsible because her \naccounts became delinquent after she relocated and her income was reduced, and \nbecause she was unemployed or underemployed because of her injury and maternity \nleave. Applicant claimed she is willing to repay her debts. She promised to start paying \nher debts in 2019 because currently she has the income to do so.  \n \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence about her current financial \nsituation (her and her husband\u2019s monthly income, living expenses, current debts, \nsavings, monthly remainder, etc.). She did not present evidence to show that she has a \nworking budget or that she has participated in financial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn issuing the SOR, DOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive);1 and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent, effective June 8, 2017.  \n \nThe DOD considers ADP positions to be sensitive positions. For a person to be \neligible for sensitive duties, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness must be \nsuch that assigning the person to a sensitive position is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States. SEAD 4, E(4); SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6 2.d. \nApplicants for ADP positions are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive \nbefore any final unfavorable access determination is made.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \n                                            \n1 ADP cases are adjudicated under the provisions of the Directive. (Deputy Under Secretary of \nDefense\u2019s Memorandum for the Director, DOHA, dated November 19, 2004.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nA public trust position decision resolves whether it is clearly consistent with the \ninterest of national security to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to sensitive \ninformation. The Government must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts \nalleged in the SOR. If it does, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. The applicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nor continue his or her access to sensitive information.  \n \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national security as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the Government. Access to sensitive information determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials. SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). \nEligibility for a public trust position decisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned. They are merely an indication that the applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the Government has established for issuing access to sensitive \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel [trustworthiness] concern such as excessive \ngambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse \nor dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds . . . .  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by her admissions. She averred her financial \nproblems resulted from her resignation from a high-paying nursing position and \nrelocating to another state to help her ailing mother in 2013, and periods of \nunemployment or underemployment resulting from an injury (five months) and child-\ndelivery (four months). Except for the periods of unemployment discussed above, \nApplicant has been fully employed with hospitals since 2004 and with a federal \ncontractor since October 2018. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablished these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible \napplicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nI considered the seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20; however, only one is potentially applicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s [position of trust] eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a \n[position of trust]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents \nevidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in [trustworthiness] decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nThe AG \u00b6 20(b) financial considerations mitigating condition is not fully raised by \nthe facts in this case and does not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in 2013, and are ongoing and unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is sufficient to establish that circumstances beyond her control \ncontributed to her financial problems: 1) she having to relocate to help her ailing mother; \n2) a five-month period of disability due to a foot injury; and 3) a four-month period of \nmaternity leave. (Applicant presented no evidence and it is not clear from the evidence \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhether she received disability compensation, and whether she received pay while on \nmaternity leave.)  \n \n \nEven giving the benefit of the doubt to Applicant on the above issues, she failed \nto establish that she has been financially responsible under the circumstances. She did \nnot present sufficient evidence of good-faith efforts to pay her debts; that she has been \nin contact with her creditors, of any payments made since she acquired the debts, of \nany payment agreements, disputed debts, or of efforts to otherwise resolve her \ndelinquencies.  \n \n \nI considered that Applicant resolved the accounts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f after \nshe received the SOR. However, I consider her last minute efforts too little and too late \nto establish a track record of financial responsibility. I also considered that Applicant \ndisputed some debts, but she failed to provide documentary evidence to establish a \nreasonable basis for her disputes. \n \n \nApplicant testified that her financial situation has improved with her current job \nand that she now has the financial means to pay any delinquent debts. Notwithstanding, \nshe provided little information about her current earnings and financial position. She did \nnot provide any information about her monthly income and expenses, and whether her \ncurrent income is sufficient to pay her current living expenses and debts. There is no \ninformation to show that she participated in financial counseling or that she follows a \nbudget. The available information is insufficient to establish clear indications that she \ndoes not have a current financial problem, or that her financial problem is being \nresolved, or is under control. Applicant failed to establish that she has a track record of \nfinancial responsibility. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to \ndemonstrate financial responsibility or that his financial problems are being resolved. \nThe financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment: \n \nApplicant, 38, has been employed with hospitals since 2004 and with a federal \ncontractor since October 2018. This is her first position of trust application. Her \nevidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. It is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, there is a \nstrong presumption against granting eligibility for a position of trust. Unmitigated \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfinancial considerations trustworthiness concerns lead me to conclude that granting \neligibility for a position of trust to Applicant is not warranted at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 24-year-old marine painter employed by a defense contractor since February 2018. She graduated from high school in June 2013 and worked at various private-sector jobs until she was hired by her current employer. She married in December 2014 and separated in April 2016. Her husband is 37 years old. According to Applicant, they separated because of her husband\u2019s anger issues and abusive behavior. (GX 2 at 2.)

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 18, 2018. On July 26, \n2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nher a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 19, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 17, 2019, \nand the case was assigned to me on October 24, 2019. On the same day, the Defense \n\n \n2 \n \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nfor November 12, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) \n1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any documentary evidence. I kept \nthe record open until December 2, 2019, to enable her to submit documentary evidence. \nShe did not submit any additional evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations. Her admissions \nin her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old marine painter employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2018. She graduated from high school in June 2013 and worked at various \nprivate-sector jobs until she was hired by her current employer. She married in December \n2014 and separated in April 2016. Her husband is 37 years old. According to Applicant, \nthey separated because of her husband\u2019s anger issues and abusive behavior. (GX 2 at \n2.) She was unemployed from about July to November 2014 after she and her husband \nmoved to another state to be nearer to his family. (Tr. 25.) She and her husband have a \nfour-year-old son, who has had multiple medical problems since birth. She has never held \na security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant and her son have lived with her mother since June 2015. She moved in \nwith her mother to help care for her father, who was dying from cancer and has since \npassed away. (Tr. 22.) She shares the rent with her mother, paying about $900 per month. \nShe testified that her son receives Social Security benefits of $726 per month. (Tr. 42-\n43.) Applicant earns $20.80 per hour, which amounts to about $635 per month. (Tr. 24.) \nHer net monthly remainder after paying all expenses is about $600 or $700. She has \nabout $2,500 in her 401(k) retirement account and nominal amounts in her checking and \nsaving accounts. (Tr. 44-45.)  \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has not filed a divorce petition, but she believes her \nhusband has. However, she has not received any documents regarding a divorce. She \nand her husband have a formal separation agreement, but she does not believe that it \nallocates responsibility for joint debts incurred during the marriage. She testified that she \nand her husband have a verbal agreement that he would take care of the car payments \nand a joint bankruptcy petition, and she would be responsible for their son\u2019s medical \nexpenses. (Tr. 49-50.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling about $27,602 that are reflected in \ncredit reports dated September 19, 2018, and May 14, 2019. (GX 3; GX 4.) The evidence \nconcerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: deficiency after voluntary automobile repossession, charged off \nfor $12,829. Applicant and her husband bought this vehicle in February 2016. The title \n\n \nand loan were in both names. Applicant testified that she was giving her husband the \nmoney to make the payments on this vehicle, but he failed to make the payments on this \nvehicle as well as two others. She erroneously believed that she was not liable for the \ndebt because it was charged off. (Tr. 31-33.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: medical debt, referred for collection of $606. Applicant testified that \nshe incurred this debt when she went to an urgent-care clinic when she had an allergic \nreaction to a medication. She testified that she contacted TRICARE and made the $30 \ncopayment, but she did not submit any documentation that she made the copayment or \nthat the debt was otherwise resolved. (Tr. 34.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: bank account overdraft, referred for collection of $182. Applicant \ntestified that the overdraft occurred when her husband withdrew money from the account \nwithout telling her. She was notified of the overdraft in July or August of 2015, but she \nforgot about it. She testified that she paid the debt shortly before the hearing, but she \nprovided no documentation of the payment. (Tr. 35-36.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: medical debt, referred for collection of $108. Applicant testified that \nthis debt was for her son\u2019s hospitalization when he was three and a half months old. She \ntestified that the debt was covered by TRICARE, that she had made the copayment, and \nthat the debt was resolved. She provided no documentation to support her testimony. (Tr. \n36-37.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: car insurance premium, referred for collection of $1,612. Applicant \ntestified that she cancelled the insurance after two of their vehicles were repossessed. \nShe testified that she had documentation of the insurance cancellation, but it was locked \nin a storage shed at their previous residence, and her husband would not give her access \nto it. (Tr. 38.) She testified that she would contact the insurance company to obtain \ndocumentation, but she submitted nothing. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: deficiency after automobile repossession, referred for collection \nof $12,265. Applicant testified that this was another debt on which her husband failed to \nmake the payments after she gave him the money to do so. She was unaware that he \nhad not made the payments until she came home from work in early 2015 and found that \nher car was gone. She has not contacted the creditor or the collection agency about this \ndebt. (Tr. 40-41.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that her husband was medically discharged from the Army and \nreceives benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). When Applicant \nresponded to the SOR, she stated that her husband intended to file a bankruptcy petition. \nAt the hearing, she testified that her husband believed that a bankruptcy petition would \nmake him ineligible for his VA benefits, and that he now intends to resolve their debt \nthrough debt consolidation. (Tr. 44-42.) She submitted no evidence of a debt- \nconsolidation plan or other resolution of her delinquent debts.  \n \n \n \n3 \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n5 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant has encountered several conditions \nlargely beyond her control: a four-month period of unemployment, medical problems for \nherself and her child that were not fully covered by insurance, the financial irresponsibility \nof her husband, and a marital breakup. However, she has not acted responsibly. She has \ntaken no significant action to resolve the two repossession deficiencies alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f and the bank overdraft in \u00b6 1.c. Instead, she has relied on her irresponsible \nhusband to resolve them. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or obtained financial \ncounseling, and her financial problems are not under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant claimed that she had resolved the two \nmedical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d and the delinquent insurance premium \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but she submitted no documentation to support her claims. \nApplicants who claim that specific debts have been resolved are expected to present \ndocumentary evidence to support their claims. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. \nBd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n7 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant was sincere and candid at the hearing. She is financially \nunsophisticated and apparently has allowed her older and abusive husband to take \nadvantage of her. Her reaction to her financial problems has been largely passive. She \ndid not take advantage of the additional time I gave her to support her testimony with \ndocumentary evidence. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 25, 2018. On \nAugust 12, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines H and E.

On October 8, 2019, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 3. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice \nadvising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of Item 3 on the ground that it \nwas not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise any objection to \nItem 3 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond to the FORM, he could be \nconsidered to have waived any such objection, and that Item 3 could be considered as \nevidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, including a copy of Item 3, but did \nnot either respond to the FORM or otherwise object to Item 3. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 31, has never married and does not have children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2011. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineer \nsince July 2016. He previously worked for this same employer from September 2011 \nthrough August 2015. He was granted a DOD security clearance in December 2012. \n(Items 1, 2) \n \nApplicant left his job in 2015 to relocate to a new city, and to explore \u201cthe world\u201d \nand employment opportunities outside of the defense sector. He remained unemployed \nthrough July 2016. During this period of unemployment, he used illegal drugs, which is \nthe subject of the SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2) \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use consisted of: 1) consuming a food product infused with \nmarijuana one time in November 2015; 2) using cocaine that he purchased on three \noccasions between February and June 2016; and 3) using ecstasy twice between June \nand July 2016. He described his drug use as \u201crecreational\u201d and \u201cexperimental.\u201d He \nattributed his drug use to an exploration phase in his life and to living in a city where drug \nuse was prevalent and normalized. (Items 1, 2) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he used drugs knowing that they were illegal. He \nadmitted that his drug use was a \u201clapse in judgment.\u201d He has abstained from any drug \nuse since resuming his defense-contractor employment, and has no intent to use any \nillegal drugs in the future. Applicant reported his drug use on his SCA, and candidly \ndiscussed it during his SI and in his SOR response. He relocated from the city in which \nhe used drugs. Despite the fact that Applicant lives in a state that allows recreational use \nof marijuana, he understands that its use remains incompatible with the maintenance of \nhis defense-contractor position and access to classified information. (Items 1, 2, 3) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant not only used illegal drugs, but did so \u201cwhile \ngranted access to classified information.\u201d Although Applicant answered \u201cI admit\u201d to each \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR allegation, in his accompanying explanations, he denied that he had any access to \nclassified information during the period of unemployment when he used drugs. In the \nFORM, the Government argued that Applicant\u2019s clearance should be denied on the basis \nthat he used drugs \u201cwhile holding a security clearance.\u201d Applicant\u2019s assertion that his \naccess to classified information was limited to the duration of his employment was \nunrebutted by the Government. The record did not otherwise establish the status of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance during the period of his drug use. (Item 1) \n \n       Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n  \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \n\n \n4 \n \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana, cocaine that he purchased, and ecstasy \nestablishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia. \n \nThe SOR alleged facts that rendered the following additional disqualifying \ncondition potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 25 (f) any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position. Applicant was granted a DOD \nsecurity clearance in 2012 while employed in the defense sector. His drug use occurred \nduring a period when he was unemployed and exploring employment opportunities \noutside of the defense sector. He has not used any illegal drugs since resuming his \ndefense-contractor position. The record did not specify whether Applicant retained his \nsecurity clearance during his period of unemployment. However, regardless of the status \nof his security clearance, during the period when he used illegal drugs, he neither had \n\n \n5 \n \naccess to classified information nor was in a position where he could potentially have \nbeen exposed to classified or sensitive information. Thus, I find that there is insufficient \nrecord evidence to apply AG \u00b6 25(f). \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n \nApplicant experimented with using illegal drugs, including cocaine that he \npurchased, during a relatively short phase in his life that has ended. He was candid about \nhis drug use during the security clearance process and acknowledged that it was a lapse \nin judgment. He has since resumed employment in the defense sector in a different city \nfrom where he used drugs. He demonstrated that he understands that illegal drug use is \nincompatible with maintaining his defense-contractor position and his access to classified \ninformation. He has not used any illegal drugs in over three years and has no intent to \nuse any illegal drugs in the future. Based on the record evidence, I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not likely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use establishes the general concern involving questionable \njudgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, which is set forth under \nthis guideline in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \n \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.\u201d  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factor: \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline H, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use is not likely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his illegal drug use. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a PRC-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, whose parents are PRC citizen- residents. He entered the United States in 1985, and he was naturalized in 2001. He is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior enterprise software architect with his current employer since November 2015. He received his primary education from PRC schools, as well as a bachelor\u2019s degree from a PRC university in 1982. He received a doctorate in 1991 from a respected university in the United States. He has never served with the U.S. military or any other military. It is unclear if he ever held a security clearance.

Eligibility for \na security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 22, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \na Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On August 29, 2019, the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated September 20, 2019, Applicant responded to the \nSOR, and he elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nA complete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 16, 2019, \nand he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on October 29, 2019. His response was due on \nNovember 28, 2019. Applicant timely submitted a one-page response to the FORM which \nwas accepted without objection. The case was assigned to me on December 10, 2019.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) appearing in 19 \nU.S. Government publications, which were identified, but only fragments of extracts of \nthose publications were attached to the request. Facts are proper for administrative notice \nwhen they are easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the \ncase.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 \nF.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See \nStein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts \nfor administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative \ninformation or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 \n(2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents). In this instance, although \nDepartment Counsel has selected only certain pages of facts appearing in the identified \npublications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered the \npublications in their entirety. \n \nThe eight press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice were presented \napparently to substantiate that the PRC actively pursues collection of U.S. economic and \npropriety information, and, therefore, Applicant\u2019s relationships with his various family \nmembers in the PRC raises suspicion of him. The cases cited do not involve Applicant \npersonally, nor do they involve espionage through any familial relationship. The anecdotal \nevidence of criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens or foreign nationals is of decreased \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nrelevance to an assessment of Applicant\u2019s security suitability, especially where there is \nno evidence that Applicant, or any member of his family, was ever involved in any aspect \nof the cited cases or ever targeted by any PRC intelligence officials. Furthermore, the \npress releases are little more than self-congratulatory public relations products issued by \na public relations office, with the collateral effect of deterring other criminals contemplating \npossible attacks on our national security. \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, \nFederal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth below \nunder the PRC subsection. However, while I do not reject the facts set forth in the press \nreleases, the inference that somehow Applicant and/or his family participated in criminal \nactivity was not alleged or argued, and is specifically rejected.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with one relatively brief comment, \nall of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nBackground \n \nApplicant is a PRC-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, whose parents are PRC citizen-\nresidents. He entered the United States in 1985, and he was naturalized in 2001. He is a \n61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior enterprise \nsoftware architect with his current employer since November 2015. He received his \nprimary education from PRC schools, as well as a bachelor\u2019s degree from a PRC \nuniversity in 1982. He received a doctorate in 1991 from a respected university in the \nUnited States. He has never served with the U.S. military or any other military. It is unclear \nif he ever held a security clearance. He was married in the PRC in 1988 to a PRC-born \nU.S. citizen. He has one child, born in the United States in 1994.  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nTo protect his privacy, general source information pertaining to Applicant and his \nfamily members discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86); \nand Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview). \n \nApplicant and his wife have lived in the United States for over three decades, and \nhis adult daughter has resided here her entire life. As noted above, Applicant\u2019s parents \nare PRC citizen-residents. His nearly 100-year-old father was, before his retirement in the \nearly 1980s, a PRC military officer; and his mother, also in her 90s, was an employee of \na provincial broadcasting bureau. Applicant has two brothers and a sister, all of whom are \nPRC citizen-residents: one brother, in his 60s, is an employee of an electrical company; \nhis other brother, nearly in his 60s, is an employee in the technical department of the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nprovincial broadcasting bureau; and his sister, in her 60s, was, before her retirement, a \nlaboratory technician with an industrial institute. He also has a half-sister, in her 70s, who \nis a PRC citizen-resident, and she was employed by a natural resource institute affiliated \nwith a state university. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have had any affiliation with \nthe PRC government, military, security, defense industry, or intelligence services, except \nas described above. In November 2015, Applicant reported monthly to quarterly \ntelephone or e-mail contact with them. (Item 3, at 26-36; Item 2, at 2)  \n \nOver a decade ago, Applicant provided approximately $2,000 to his mother. (Item \n3, at 38) He has no foreign assets or foreign financial interests controlled by him or on his \nbehalf. (Item 3, at 38) \n \nApplicant has taken two trips to the PRC: In 2009, he visited his family for between \n11 and 20 days, and in 2014, he did so again for the same purpose and duration. (Item \n3, at 41-45) His sister visited the United States in 2016 to attend his daughter\u2019s college \ngraduation. (Item 4, at 2) In describing the relationships that he has with his family, \nApplicant stated the following: \n \nThe nature of my relationships with my family members in China are such \nthat it is unlikely that I will be in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of my family members in China and the interests of the United \nStates. \n \nThere is no conflict of interest because my sense of loyalty and obligation \nto my family members in China is so minimal compared to my deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to my immediate family in the \nUnited States that I can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States. \n \nMy contact and communication with my family members in China are so \ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk \nfor foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nI understand the current US-China relations, and I am completely on the \nUnited States side. In fact, my political views have been so different from \nthe Chinese government\u2019s standings for decades. \n \n(Response to the FORM, dated November 21, 2019) \n \nPRC \n \n The PRC is an international bully without regard for democracy or civil rights. It \nhas an authoritarian Communist government, with powerful military forces, including \nstrategic nuclear weapons and missiles. It is geographically vast and has a population of \nover a billion people. It has significant resources and an economy that in recent years has \nexpanded substantially. In the PRC, reported human rights problems include suppression \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nof political dissent, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, disappearance, \ntorture and mistreatment of prisoners, and arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life. The \nPRC also monitors telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text \nmessaging, and internet communications, and sometimes nonconsensual monitoring with \nlistening devices and surreptitious searching of hotel guestrooms.  \n \nThe PRC has been characterized as \u201cthe most aggressive country conducting \nespionage against the United States, focusing on obtaining U.S. information and \ntechnologies beneficial to the [PRC\u2019s] military modernization and economic \ndevelopment.\u201d Those activities include economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, export \ncontrol violations, and technology transfer. It actively collects military, economic and \nproprietary industrial information about the United States of the following types, including: \ninformation and communications technology; military technologies, particularly marine \nsystems, aerospace and aeronautics; civilian and dual-use technologies, especially clean \ntechnologies, \nadvanced \nmaterials \nand \nmanufacturing \ntechniques, \nhealthcare, \npharmaceuticals, and related technologies, and agricultural technology; and business \ninformation, especially energy and other natural resources and macroeconomic \ninformation. Americans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by \nthe PRC. \u201cThe crux of the [PRC] approach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability \nbut to appeal to an individual\u2019s desire to help [the PRC] out in some way . . . ethnic \ntargeting to arouse feelings of obligation is the single most distinctive feature of [the \nPRC\u2019s] intelligence operations.\u201d The PRC\u2019s pursuit of intellectual property, sensitive \nresearch and development plans, and U.S. Person data, remains a significant threat to \nthe U.S. government and private sector. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \nofficials have characterized PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading \nthreat to the security of U.S. technology. \n \nWhile there have been a number of criminal incidents involving individuals, \ncompanies, and PRC\u2019s intelligence officers improperly acquiring U.S. economic \nintelligence and proprietary information, there is no direct or indirect connection to, or \ninvolvement with, Applicant or his family.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6.  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are citizen-residents of PRC. His nearly 100-year- \nold father was a PRC military officer, but he retired over three decades ago; his mother, \nalso in her 90s, was an employee of a provincial broadcasting bureau;  his brother, in his \n60s, is an employee of an electrical company; his other brother, nearly in his 60s, is an \nemployee in the technical department of the provincial broadcasting bureau; his sister, in \nher 60s, was, before her retirement, a laboratory technician with an industrial institute; \nand his half-sister, in her 70s, was employed by a coal institute affiliated with a state \nuniversity. None of Applicant\u2019s family members have had any affiliation with the PRC \ngovernment, military, security, defense industry, or intelligence services, except as \ndescribed above.  \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nWhen foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a \nforeign country as well as each individual family member must be analyzed. (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003)) If only one relative lives in a foreign country, \nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)) \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. Moreover, Guideline B is not limited \nto countries hostile to the United States. (ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May \n19, 2004) (\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d). Furthermore, \u201ceven friendly countries can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 00-00317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. \n29, 2002))  \n \nFriendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States. It is reasonable to presume that a contentious \nrelationship, or the absence of a democratic government, is not determinative, but it may \nmake it more likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen \nthrough relatives or associates in that foreign country. In considering the nature of the \ngovernment, an administrative judge must also consider any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. (See ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006))  \n \nIn this instance, as noted above, there is substantial evidence to reflect that the \nPRC aggressively engages in economic espionage or military intelligence activity directed \ntoward the United States, and that it sponsors acts of attempted destabilization or actual \nterrorism toward other countries. The activities of PRC authorities are sufficient to \nestablish a potential \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 a risk that is greater than the normal risk inherent \nin having a family member living under a foreign government. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have \nbeen established as they pertain to Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply. In reaching this conclusion, I have considered the \ntotality of Applicant\u2019s ties to the PRC, as well as to his family members still residing there. \nIn addition, there are his immediate family members who are U.S. citizen-residents.  \n \nThe Government has submitted facts to reflect that the PRC engages in economic \nespionage and/or military intelligence activity directed toward the United States. It also \nseeks to intimidate its own citizens. All PRC citizens become potential victims of PRC \n\u201cterrorism,\u201d as much as the residents of Hong Kong; the Uyghur Muslims of the Xinjiang \nregion; and the people of Tibet have become the victims of PRC\u2019s activities. However, \nwhile there is significant nefarious activity generated by the PRC, they can only go so far \nwithout either modifying their practices or facing the wrath, and trade tariffs, of the U.S. \nGovernment.  \n \nWith relatively low-profile parents and siblings, some of whom are significantly \nelderly, there is a very low potential of the PRC government forcing Applicant to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and those of the PRC, or those family \nmembers. Since arriving in the United States in 1985, Applicant has seen his parents, two \nbrothers, and sister on only two occasions, during his visits to the PRC in 2009 and 2014. \nThat computes to two meetings in 35 years. He saw his sister on one additional occasion \nwhen she attended his daughter\u2019s college graduation in 2016. The PRC may be a \ndestabilizing factor to the world, but there is little evidence of any continuing close \nrelationship between Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings with the PRC that would raise a \nheightened risk.  \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s ties to the PRC, essentially only to his elderly parents and his \nsiblings, remain, they are outweighed by his deep and long-standing relationships and \nloyalties in the United States. His life, immediate family, home, assets, and professional \ncareer are in the United States. His deep relationship with the United States is such that \nI find that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of the PRC. He can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation. The PRC is \nconsidered the most aggressive country conducting espionage against the United States, \nfocusing on obtaining U.S. information and technologies beneficial to the PRC\u2019s military \nmodernization and economic development. The PRC\u2019s pursuit of intellectual property, \nsensitive research and development plans, and U.S. Person data, remains a significant \nthreat to the U.S. government and private sector. U.S. Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement officials have characterized PRC\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities \nas the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology. Applicant\u2019s parents and siblings \nare citizen-residents of the PRC. \n \nApplicant was born, raised, and substantially educated in the PRC. His parents \nand siblings are citizen-residents of PRC. His nearly 100-year-old father was a PRC \nmilitary officer, but he retired over three decades ago; his mother, also in her 90s, was an \nemployee of a provincial broadcasting bureau;  his brother, in his 60s, is an employee of \nan electrical company; his other brother, nearly in his 60s, is an employee in the technical \ndepartment of the provincial broadcasting bureau; his sister, in her 60s, was, before her \nretirement, a laboratory technician with an industrial institute; and his half-sister, in her \n70s, was employed by a natural resource institute affiliated with a state university. None \nof Applicant\u2019s family member have had any affiliation with the PRC government, military, \nsecurity, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence services, except as \ndescribed above. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant entered the United States nearly 35 years ago, and he was \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nnaturalized in 2001. He received a doctorate in 1991 from a respected university in the \nUnited States. He is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a senior enterprise software architect with his current employer since November 2015. \nHe was married in 1988. He and his wife have lived in the United States for over three \ndecades, and his adult native-born daughter, a graduate of a U.S. university, has resided \nhere her entire life. He described his relationship with the elderly PRC branch of his family \nas casual and infrequent. Since arriving in the United States in 1985, he has seen his \nparents, two brothers, and sister on only two occasions, in 2009 and 2014, or two \nmeetings in 35 years. He saw his sister on one additional occasion in 2016. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me without any questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his foreign influence. \nSee SEAD 4, App. A, AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DeRamus, Esq.      \n \n \n08/12/2020 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information due to his marriage to a Chinese citizen who now has \npermanent resident status in the United States. Applicant met his burden to present \nsufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern for foreign \ninfluence based on family ties via his spouse to China. Accordingly, this case is decided \nfor Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 11, 2015. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He provided a statement during the course of a background \ninvestigation in February 2016. (Exhibit 4) Thereafter, on October 15, 2016, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline B for foreign influence due to his \nrelationship with his fianc\u00e9e who was then a citizen of and resident in China.  \n \nApplicant, with assistance of counsel, answered the SOR on November 17, \n2016. He denied the SOR factual allegation, explaining he had married his fianc\u00e9e in \nJuly 2016 and she was legally residing with him in the United States. The answer was \nextensive, consisting of a six-page legal memorandum and six enclosures, some of \nwhich will be referred to as evidentiary exhibits herein. He also requested an in-person \nhearing before an administrative judge.   \n \nDepartment Counsel indicated they were ready to proceed on January 25, 2019. \nBetween January 30, 2019, and August 1, 2019, the case was assigned to three \nadministrative judges before it was assigned to me on August 9, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing took place as scheduled on September 26, 2019. Both Department \nCounsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits 1-4 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A-B. Applicant as well as his spouse \nwere both called as witnesses and were subject to cross-examination by Department \nCounsel.  \n \nI took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of certain \nfacts concerning the country of China per Department Counsel\u2019s written request. \n(Exhibit 3) The essential facts about China are discussed below. The hearing transcript \n(Tr.) was received on October 11, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nAt the close of the evidence, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend \nthe SOR to conform to the evidence admitted, without objections, to the following factual \nallegations under Guideline B: (a) Your spouse is a citizen of China and a resident of \nthe United States; (b) Your mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of and residents \nin China; and (c) Your brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. (Tr. 11-13, 101; \nAppellate Exhibit I)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance \nfor his job as a staff engineer with a company that does business in the defense \nindustry. He has worked for this company since 2008. He describes his job as a lead \nsystems engineer working in multiple fields with an emphasis in satellite \ncommunications. (Tr. 28, 71) Before his current job, he was self-employed as a \nconsulting engineer during 1996-2008. Applicant is a longtime clearance holder. He has \nworked for various companies, including his own firm, in the defense industry during the \nlast 40 years. His most recent security clearance was granted in 2011. (Exhibit 1 at 27)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, awarded in 1976, \nand he has a master\u2019s degree in the same field, awarded in 1978. He also earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in operations research in 1984. He married for the first time in July \n2016 to his current spouse, a citizen of China. (Enclosure 3 to Answer) He has no \nchildren.  \n \nThe genesis of this case goes back to 2013-2014 when Applicant decided he \nwanted to pursue marriage with an Asian woman and used the services of an online \nmatch-making service for that purpose. He informed his employer of his intention during \na debriefing regarding foreign travel to China in 2014 when he traveled to meet a \nChinese woman. (Exhibit 2) That same Chinese woman visited him in the United States. \nShortly thereafter in January 2015, the FBI interviewed Applicant concerning his contact \nwith the Chinese citizen. Upon completion of the interview, the FBI informed the \ncompany facility security officer (FSO) that the interview went well, nothing unusual was \noccurring, and they were satisfied that nothing was going on that the company needed \nto be concerned about. Subsequently, Applicant and the Chinese woman decided to not \npursue the relationship further. \n \nApplicant met the woman who is now his spouse in 2015 using the same online \nmedium he used previously. The initial contact was by e-mail that gradually increased \nfrom a few times weekly to daily as well as two video calls per week. He traveled to \nChina to meet her in 2015 or early 2016. She also traveled to the United States before \naccepting his proposal of marriage. She returned to the United States in June 2016 and \nthey married the following month. She has since resided here with Applicant. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in China in 1971. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin textile engineering from a Chinese university in 1994. She then worked as a \npurchasing agent for the next 20 years or so for several trading companies in the \nimport-and-export business. (Tr. 90-91) Some of the trading companies were Chinese-\nowned businesses while two were foreign-owned businesses (Czech Republic). She \nhas no previous marriages and she has no children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse entered the United States in 2016 on a conditional basis as a \nfianc\u00e9e of a U.S. citizen, also known as the fianc\u00e9e visa. In September 2016, based on \nher marriage to Applicant, her immigration status was adjusted to conditional resident \nstatus, and she was issued the so-called Green Card. (Enclosure 2 to Answer) In July \n2018, her conditional resident status was extended for 18 months, as her initial Green \nCard was due to expire in September 2018. (Exhibit B) She was granted permanent \nresident status in August 2019 based on a bona fide marriage to Applicant, and she was \nissued a Green Card valid for ten years. (Exhibit A)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse spent the first year or so getting settled in her new home. She \nhas not been employed in the United States, but since 2018 she has been a full-time \nstudent pursuing an MBA degree on full scholarship at a state university. (Tr. 35) She is \nstudying business data analytics, and she anticipates she will complete the MBA \nprogram in the summer of 2020. She is highly focused on achieving good grades, and \n\n \n4 \n \nshe intends to turn her attention to studying for the U.S. citizenship test upon completion \nof the MBA program.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse maintains contact with her immediate family in China, \nconsisting of her mother, father, and brother. She speaks with them via a Chinese multi-\npurpose messaging, social media, and mobile payment app, which is on her smart \nphone. Due to the language barrier, Applicant does not participate in the calls other than \na greeting or wave. Applicant and his spouse traveled to China in February 2018 for the \nNew Year\u2019s holiday and Applicant met his in-laws during the trip. Otherwise, he has had \nno in-person contact with his Chinese in-laws. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s father and mother, age 83 and 76, have both been retired \nfor more than 20 years. Neither were employed directly by the Chinese government nor \nthe Chinese military. His spouse speaks with her parents at least weekly. Her brother \nworks as a purchasing agent for a manufacturing business (large machinery). He is not \nemployed directly by the Chinese government or military. Given the time difference and \nher brother\u2019s job, she has little communication with her brother. (Tr. 87) She has the \nsame amount of contact with her sister-in-law who works as a bookkeeper for a local \ncollege in China.  \n \nApplicant does not have business, financial, or property interests in China. The \nsame is true for his spouse except for a bank account in China, which she has \nmaintained for occasional online shopping at a Chinese online retail business. She has \nnot used the bank account for months and estimated a balance of less than US $1,000. \nShe has not made a deposit to the account since she departed China, and she is simply \nspending down the remainder.  \n \nAs a longtime clearance holder, Applicant does not discuss his work with his \nspouse, other than the general unclassified work that he performs for the company. (Tr. \n62) He expressed a good understanding of and sensitivity to the security issues \ninvolved with his spouse\u2019s family members in China. (Tr. 66-68) His spouse now knows \nhe has a security clearance due to her participation in the hearing, but he did not inform \nher earlier, although she may have learned about the matter during his telephone \ndiscussions with his attorney. (Tr. 62) His spouse stated that she told her parents that \nApplicant is an engineer, but that was the extent of the conversation. (Tr. 83)  \n \nConcerning the country of China, Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice contains an extensive discussion of the security concerns \nassociated with China. (Exhibit 3) The essential facts about China are the following: (1) \nChina is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount \nauthority; (2) China (along with Russia) is the most aggressive collector of intelligence \n(both industrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China \nhas a poor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, \nrespect for civil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency \nin government, worker rights, as well as discrimination, societal abuses, and human \ntrafficking.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to China should disqualify him from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 6 as follows:  \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology.  \n \n \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of China. Suffice it to say, the \nU.S. Government views the behavior of the Chinese government as presenting a \nserious national security concern. The heightened-risk element is easily satisfied. Given \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to China, via his spouse, the Government has established its \ncase under Guideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.  \n \n \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \n\n \n7 \n \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.  \n \n \nChina\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy \nperson. He was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He appears to have \ncooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process \nand during an interview with the FBI. He made a good impression upon me during the \nhearing.  \n \n \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to China via his spouse and I am \nnot unduly concerned. Applicant has a demonstrated record as a reliable clearance \nholder and employee in the defense industry for the last 40 years or so. He expressed a \ngood understanding of and sensitivity to the security issues involved with his spouse\u2019s \nfamily members in China. (Tr. 66-68) Although the family ties to China still count and \ncannot be dismissed out of hand, the strength of those ties are diminished given the \nfacts and circumstances here. On balance, his ties to the United States are far stronger \nthan the largely nominal family ties to China.  \n \n \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who \nhave Chinese citizenship. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest, because \nApplicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the \nUnited States that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n8 \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility granted.  \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, and 3.a-3.c, with explanations, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. She has never married and has one child. She is seeking a position requiring a security clearance. She previously held a security clearance before it was revoked by another government agency (AGA) in 2013. She currently works as an information technology (IT) systems engineer. She has worked for her current employer (her clearance sponsor) since June 2018. She holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. She also owns a fitness business. (Tr. 11-8; 46; GE 5-8) The SOR alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant committed employee theft between 1989 and 1990 by stealing approximately 25 pieces of clothing (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that between 2000 and 2005, while employed by employer-1 (E1), and between 2005 and 2007, while employed by employer-2 (E2), Applicant stole numerous computer hardware items, including computer towers, monitors, keyboards, mouse sets, speakers, laptop computers, memory sticks, a hard drive, and a digital scanner (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c). The employee theft of clothing was also alleged as criminal activity (SOR \u00b6 2.a).

(The SOR in this case was styled as an automated data processing \n\n \n2 \n \n \n(ADP) trustworthiness determination, however, I have determined that Applicant was \nbeing sponsored by her employer for a security clearance (See HE III). This case will be \ntreated as a security clearance determination. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 5, 2017, and requested a hearing. \n(This case is dated because Applicant lost her original employer sponsorship in 2017 \nand the processing of her case ceased at that time. Upon recently receiving new \nsponsorship, Applicant\u2019s case processing was resumed.) The case was assigned to me \non November 26, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on December 9, 2019, and the hearing was held as scheduled on \nJanuary 9, 2020. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-8, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. The Government\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant was marked \nas hearing exhibit (HE) I and the Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as HE II. \nApplicant testified and presented the testimony of one witness. She offered exhibits \n(AE) A-H, which were all admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on January 17, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, and 3.a-3.c, with explanations, and denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 49 years old. She has never married and has one child. She is \nseeking a position requiring a security clearance. She previously held a security \nclearance before it was revoked by another government agency (AGA) in 2013. She \ncurrently works as an information technology (IT) systems engineer. She has worked for \nher current employer (her clearance sponsor) since June 2018. She holds a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. She also owns a fitness business. (Tr. 11-8; 46; GE 5-8)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant committed employee theft \nbetween 1989 and 1990 by stealing approximately 25 pieces of clothing (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It \nalso alleged that between 2000 and 2005, while employed by employer-1 (E1), and \nbetween 2005 and 2007, while employed by employer-2 (E2), Applicant stole numerous \ncomputer hardware items, including computer towers, monitors, keyboards, mouse sets, \nspeakers, laptop computers, memory sticks, a hard drive, and a digital scanner (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.c). The employee theft of clothing was also alleged as criminal activity (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). Under Guideline M, the SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in illegal downloading \nof movies from 1993-2008; music from 2008-2011; and computer software, games, and \nemulators (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c). \n \n \n \nIn December 2011, Applicant\u2019s employer sponsored her for access to AGA\u2019s \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI). Applicant held a top secret clearance at that \n\n \n3 \n \n \ntime. A corresponding background investigation ensued and Applicant was interviewed \nand required to take a polygraph examination. In March 2012, during her interview, \nApplicant admitted that in approximately 1990, she used stolen credit cards to purchase \nclothing items. The credit cards were from a customer who reported her purse stolen \nfrom the store where Applicant worked. A police investigation revealed Applicant and \nher friend as the crime perpetrators. She was charged with felony theft, but the charges \nwere reduced to misdemeanors. She paid restitution and served a work-release \nsentence. (Tr. 48; GE 2-5) \n \n \nAlso during the March 2012 interview, Applicant admitted that while working for \ntwo different employers (one was a successor contractor to the other) from 2000 to \n2007 she took, without permission or authorization, numerous computer items, including \nmultiple computer towers, monitors, keyboards, mouse sets, speakers, and memory \nsticks. She also took at least three laptop computers. She used these herself at home \nand gave several away to family members, her friends, and even her church. The value \nof the items was in excess of several thousands of dollars. She explained to the \ninterviewer that she took the items because she could not afford to buy similar items at \nthe time and the company was overstocked with these surplus items. She was told by a \ngovernment employee that the items were to be strictly accounted for, but he also \ninsinuated that he did not care if she took things. She knew what she was doing was \nwrong and she stopped. In her SOR answer and during her testimony, Applicant backed \naway from total acceptance of responsibility for her actions and claimed she had verbal \nauthority from a supervisor to take the items. She also claimed that there was a culture \nof permissiveness when it came to computer accountability at these companies during \nthat time. Her SOR responses on this issue and her testimony were not credible. (Tr. \n47; GE 5-6, 8) \n \n \nApplicant further related, during her March 2012 interview, that she engaged in \nillegally downloading of music, movies, software, games, and emulators from \napproximately 1993 to 2011. She estimated that she downloaded over 10,000 songs \nvalued at over $10,000 and over hundreds of movies valued at over $5,000. She \nengaged in this activity using her personal computer equipment and other times using \nher employer\u2019s computers and peripherals. She also illegally downloaded software, \ngame programs, and emulators valued at between $400 and $1,000. Between 2002 and \n2007, she also downloaded music and movies from a government server without \nauthorization. In her hearing testimony, Applicant claimed that the permissive culture at \nthe government agency allowed the downloading from the government server for \npersonal use. (Tr. 47; GE 5, 6) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions described above were fully investigated by AGA and she was \ndenied SCI access in December 2012. Applicant appealed that decision in February \n2013, and the denial decision was sustained in March 2013. (GE 5-7) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor from 2006 to 2007 testified that he had no personal \nknowledge of Applicant taking company property during that timeframe. He commented \nthat there was a lack of accountability standards at the company when he took over his \nposition in 2006. Even though he has not worked with Applicant since that time, he has \nstayed in contact with her and is not aware of any other bad acts on her part. He \nbelieves that she learned from this incident and has grown because of it. (Tr. 37, 39-41, \n43-44) \n \n \nApplicant also presented written letters of thanks from a former employer in \n2016, and a certificate of excellence from her employer in 2008. She presented a letter \nfrom her supervisor in 2018 who fully described her talents and skills within their \norganization. He further described Applicant as a reliable and trustworthy employee. \nAdditionally, Applicant presented documentation showing her active community \ninvolvement by restoring a local residence for cancer patients and her participation in a \nlocal community workgroup. She is described as an intelligent, caring, and excellent \nteam player. Applicant testified that, other than traffic tickets, she has not had any \nfurther involvement with law enforcement. (Tr. 51; AE A-C, E, H) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n5 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe record evidence is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal \nconduct guideline, nevertheless, as a whole, Applicant\u2019s actions put into issue her \njudgment, trustworthiness and overall personal conduct, as expressed in the general \nsecurity concern in AG \u00b615 and the specific concern expressed in AG \u00b6 16(c). \nApplicant\u2019s criminal incidents in about 1990 and between 2000 and 2007 raise \nquestions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment.  \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nAppellant\u2019s crimes of theft and fraud back in 1990, when she was 20 years old, \nare remote and unique, qualifying for some mitigating consideration under AG \u00b6 17(c). \nHowever, full mitigation is not appropriate given Applicant\u2019s continuing untrustworthy \nbehavior years later by taking computer equipment without proper authority and illegally \ndownloading computer programs, music, and movies to include doing so from a \ngovernment server without authorization. Her actions cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not fully apply. While Applicant initially \naccepted responsibility for her actions, she more recently backed away from that \nresponsibility, seeking to lay blame on a permissive work culture that allowed her to \ntake property that was not hers in the form of computer hardware, software, and other \ncomputer media. Applicant receives some credit under AG \u00b6 17(c), but, AG \u00b6 17(d) \ndoes not apply.  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable:  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \n \nApplicant was arrested, charged, and ultimately pleaded guilty to lesser charges \nresulting from her theft and credit-card fraud in 1990. I find that the stated disqualifying \ncondition applies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \n \n \nAppellant\u2019s crimes of theft and fraud back in 1990, when she was 20 years old, \nare remote and unique, qualifying for some mitigating consideration. However, full \nmitigation is not appropriate given Applicant\u2019s continuing untrustworthy behavior years \nlater by taking computer equipment without proper authority and illegally downloading \ncomputer programs, music, and movies to include doing so from a government server \nwithout authorization. Her actions cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply.  \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems:  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered the following as potentially relevant: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n \n \nApplicant downloaded thousands of computer media (music, movies, software \nprograms, and games) between 1993 and 2011, to include doing so from a government \nserver, without proper authorization. The above condition is applicable.  \n \n \n \nI reviewed all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41, and I considered the \nfollowing relevant:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.   \n \n \nAlthough some time has passed since Applicant engaged in her unauthorized \naction, and she initially accepted responsibility for her actions, more recently she has \nplaced blame on the environment she was working in rather than her own behavior. \nFuture recurrence cannot be ruled out. Without accepting responsibility for her actions \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment are called into question. AG \u00b6 41(a) \ndoes not fully apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n9 \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.     \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the passage of time \nsince Applicant\u2019s actions, her letters of recommendation and commendation, the \ntestimony of her former supervisor, and her community involvement. However, what is \nmost troubling about Applicant\u2019s behavior is that she possesses an extensive IT \nbackground, yet her inappropriate conduct fell directly into her area of expertise, i.e., \ntheft of, or unauthorized use of computer hardware and software. Applicant failed to \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal conduct, criminal conduct, and use \nof information technology security concerns.  \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E, J and M. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph     2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   3.a \u2013 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n\n10 \n_____________________________ \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. In a response \nnotarized on February 2, 2018, Applicant admitted all allegations and requested a \nhearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. \nI was assigned the case on August 20, 2018.  \n \nOn September 7, 2018, a notice setting the hearing for October 3, 2018, was \nissued. Due to an administrative conflict, an amended notice was issued on September \n28, 2018, altering the time of the hearing on the same day as previously set. The \nhearing was convened as rescheduled. The Government offered eight exhibits (Exs.), \nnoted as Exs. 1-8, and Applicant presented a package of materials, collectively \n\n \n \n \n \n2\naccepted as Ex. A without objection. With no objections, all exhibits were accepted into \nthe record. Applicant also introduced one witness.  \n \nApplicant was granted through October 19, 2018, to submit any additional \nmaterials. The transcript of the proceeding (Tr.) was received on October 2, 2018. Eight \ndocuments from Applicant were forwarded to me on October 19, 2018, and accepted \nwithout objection as Exs. B-I. The record was then closed. Based on the testimony, \nmaterials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated security concerns. \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old cable technician who has performed the same type of \nwork with the same entity since April 2016. Married in 2018, Applicant and his wife have \na toddler and a preteen child. They bought their home in 2016.  \n \nApplicant completed high school and briefly attended some college. During high \nschool, starting in about March 2003, Applicant began using marijuana infrequently as a \n\u201csocial thing.\u201d (Tr. 87). He continued using the drug infrequently in college, where he \nplayed football and was subject to drug testing, but he never tested positive for an illegal \ndrug. Subsequent drug use was intermittent. In January 2016, living in a new home with \nhis new bride and a baby on the way, he was ready to face adult responsibilities. He \ndecided to quit using marijuana on New Year\u2019s Day. He has no interest in returning to \ndrug use and he has signed a statement of intent not to again use drugs under penalty \nof loss of an clearance granted. (Ex. C) Since that time, he has been subject to drug \ntesting, but never been flagged for drugs. He is committed to remaining marijuana-free. \n \nOver the past dozen years, Applicant has experienced two periods of \nunemployment \u2013 a two-month period from late October 2014 to December 2014 and a \nfive-month period from June 2009 to November 2009. He was also unemployed for \nabout three months after leaving college in 2007. He has not had financial counseling. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal and state tax returns for tax year (TY) 2007. \nAt that time, he was 19, a dependent of his mother, a full-time student, and any \n\u201cincome\u201d at issue was paid to Applicant by his mother. (Tr. 17-18) Consequently, he \nwas not required to file tax returns for that year. (Tr. 18)  \n \nFor TY 2012, based on \u201csome bad advice,\u201d Applicant failed to timely file his \nfederal tax returns. (Tr. 19) At the time, he owed approximately $1,847 for TY 2012. He \nhad his tax returns for TY 2012 done on his behalf in June 2014, but the amount owed \nwent unpaid. (Tr. 19) At the same time, his federal tax returns for TY 2013 were \nbelatedly filed, but a balance of $7,372 was not paid. (Tr. 20) They had not initially been \nfiled on time because of \u201cbad advice\u201d he had received. (Tr. 20) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant used a professional tax preparer and had his TY 2014 federal \ntax returns filed. (Tr. 20) He made no payments toward taxes owed because he was \ngiven poor advice and because he was afraid he could not afford to satisfy the total \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nsums owed during a year in which he had endured a significant period of unemployment \nfollowed by a [period of reduced income. (Tr. 21) He had been advised that there was \nno urgency in filing late returns. (Tr. 23) Moreover, he had never set money aside for \nbonuses on which taxes had not been withheld. (Tr. 22) He had no savings account, \npreferring to put any saved money into his retirement account. He \u201cdidn\u2019t have a \ncomplete understanding\u201d of the tax process and what had to be filed by April 15. (Tr. 21) \nWhen the tax professional filled in missing tax returns, he told Applicant \u201clate fees were \nwaived, and things of that sort,\u201d but failed to stress the urgency of paying the amounts \ndue. (Tr. 23) \n \nToday, all federal tax returns have been filed. Regarding TY 2015, Applicant \nbelatedly filed for that year in October 2017, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was \nunable to verify that it had been filed after a request for proof of filing was initiated in \n2018. (Ex. D; Tr. 24) Due to an internal issue and past identity theft, the IRS is unable to \nidentify Applicant, making him go through a multi-step verification process. (Ex. E) He is \nnow in a repayment plan where he pays $100 each month to satisfy any outstanding tax \nbalance. (Ex. G) His overall tax balance is substantially reduced. (Tr. 29) \n \nApplicant failed to timely file state tax returns and pay owed taxes for TY 2012 \nthrough 2016. In addition, tax liens were entered against Applicant in 2015 ($3,474) and \nin 2017 ($1,561). Again, Applicant had been given poor tax advice and an initial person \nhelping him was less than thorough. Applicant has since filed state tax returns for TY \n2012 through 2016. As per state rules dictating tax repayment, he is in a repayment \nplan under which he timely pays $146.05 per month to satisfy his entire state tax \nbalance, which was last noted as a balance of $3,685.54.(see Ex. I; Applicant\u2019s e-mail \nnarrative of Oct. 17, 2018, at 2-3) \n \n \nAlso at issue are seven delinquent debts: \n \n \nADVERSE JUDGMENT - $6,201 \u2013 DISPUTED - Dating from 2016, the \ndelinquent debt is related to a rental property in which Applicant resided with his mother. \nApplicant has been unable to locate the creditor for his mother. He disputes the balance \ncited. (Tr. 54-56, 74) \n \n \nUS DEPT. OF EDUCATION COLLECTIONS - $2,269/$1,508/$1,455 \u2013 IN \nREPAYMENT as of 2016 after completion of a rehabilitation program. His balance is \nnotably reduced and he is in good standing under the repayment plan. (Ex. A; Ex. D; Tr. \n57-61) \n \n \nSTATE COLLECTION - $1,867 \u2013 UNRESOLVED \u2013 Applicant is looking in to \nsetting up some form of repayment plan. \n \n  \nBANK COLLECTION - $1,133 \u2013 IN REPAYMENT \u2013 This debt is now at $500 or \nless through timely repayments. (Ex. A; Tr. 69-72) \n \n \nGYM COLLECTION - $115 \u2013 PAID on or before February 2017. (Ex. B) \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nIn around October 2014, Applicant and other employees were terminated from a \ntelecommunications entity for falsifying records. At the time, Applicant worked two \noverlapping shifts amounting to 232 hours during each two-week pay period. (Tr. 77-78, \n80) On-call services were regularly performed before his usual regular shift began \nbecause he would often cover for other employees. For example, he might begin \nperforming on-call services at 7 a.m. before starting his nine-hour 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. \nshift. (Tr. 77-78) In doing so, he would log in for work at 7 a.m., thus reflecting a longer \nthan expected work day consisting of what could be viewed as two nine-hour shifts. (Tr. \n78) In addition, he was to be available on-call 24-hours a day as needed. (Tr. 80) During \nthose periods, he was the only employee receiving on-call assignments. (Tr. 81)  \n \nAlthough all the work Applicant reported as completed was performed, \nmanagement claimed it tracked insufficient movement of his truck. This was an internal \nearmark for activity even though some calls could be monitored from the central office \n(e.g., problems related to power outages beyond his company\u2019s control) without an \nactual trip to the problem site. (Tr. 82-83) Applicant and other techs were put on \nadministrative leave for such perceived deficiencies, during which time Applicant \nobjected. Ultimately, they were terminated for falsification of documents. (Tr. 85) \nDespite this consequence, there was no written guidance advising against this practice \nor dictating another protocol. (Tr. 85) Indeed, there had been an agreement noting that \nemployees could not be fired for anything related with the GPS system. (Tr. 86)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGUIDELINE F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nfailed to timely file federal and state tax returns and pay taxes owed for multiple years. \nIn addition, several delinquent debts were cited. This is sufficient to invoke financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant was not responsible for filing tax returns in 2007 due to his \ndependent status and youth, he failed to timely file federal tax returns and pay taxes \nowed for TYs 2012-2014; the status of his return for TY 2015 remains unresolved due to \nan identity theft issue the IRS is presently resolving. His failures were based on a \ncombination of ignorance, inexperience, youth, and bad advice. Even when he retained \nassistance to straighten out his tax situation, he was not given appropriate advice. \nHowever, his TYs 2012-2014 returns were filed in 2017. Similar misunderstanding and \npoor handling led to his failure to file and pay state tax for TYs 2012-2016 and to \naddress two liens. Those, too, have since been addressed, and the remaining debt \nowed is in timely repayment.  \n \nAside from the poor tax advice received and the IRS difficulty in verifying \nApplicant\u2019s identity due to past identity theft, Applicant has faced other issues beyond \nhis control. He has been noted as a debtor for an apartment rented by his mother and \nhe experienced periods of unemployment and reduced salary that adversely affected \nhis ability to meet his debts. Regardless, he is now in timely repayment on his student \nloans and satisfied a balance owed to a gym. He disputes the amount cited in his \nmother\u2019s apartment rental that is noted on his credit report, and he is working with his \nstate to get a payment plan to resolve a remaining debt of about $1,133. Because he \nhas not received financial counseling, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. However, his active \nmeasures to address his debts and to bridge gaps in his federal and state tax returns \nfrom five or more years ago, I find  AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(b), and AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \n \nGUIDELINE E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (10 \nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations. . . and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. . . .  \n \nMoreover, I have considered these facts in light of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating \nconditions. I find the following applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \n \nHere, Applicant\u2019s dismissal is not a minor incident. However, it occurred nearly \nsix years ago. Further, the circumstances were unusual. It appears he was deemed \nuntruthful for not physically traveling to each job site when on-call and, instead, first \nchecking such things as electrical outages before proceeding off premises with the \ncomplaint. This does not appear to be a dishonest maneuver, but rather a measure of \nefficiency or misunderstanding. In addition, GPS tracking was not meant to be used \nagainst employees in this matter. Regardless, the situation was unusual and is not likely \nto recur in the future. Today, he is completely open and candid about the circumstances \nat issue. Consequently, I find AG \u00b6 17(c) and AG \u00b6 17(e) apply.   \n \nGUIDELINE H \u2013 Drug Involvement \n \nApplicant admitted using marijuana, an illegal drug, with varying frequency from \nabout March 2003 to January 2016, This is sufficient to raise the following disqualifying \ncondition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions apply to Applicant\u2019s case:  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n \n \nApplicant quit using marijuana in January 2016, over four years ago. He did so in \nhis mid-20s, in the wake of his new found maturity, the birth of a child, and the \nresponsibilities of home ownership. Since that time he has married his partner, \nmaintained employment, and settled down. Applicant freely acknowledges and laments \nhis past marijuana use. Now a family man, he has executed a signed statement of intent \nto abstain from future drug use acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for automatic revocation of any national security eligibility granted. In light of life \nchanges in recent years and his multiple years of abstinence, AG \u00b6 26(a)-(b) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I \nam also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old cable tech who has worked for the same company \nsince April 2016. Applicant and his wife married in 2018. They bought their home in \n2016. The couple has a toddler and a preteen child. Applicant completed high school.    \n \nApplicant was met with some challenges in his youth. His stay in college was \nbrief. He became a father for the first time in his early 20s. He got involved with \nmarijuana. He lost a job under valid, but curious circumstances. He left his mother\u2019s \ncare with little or no financial or tax sense. Applicant relied on poor advice regarding the \nfiling of federal and states taxes, and the need to timely pay the taxes owed. His early \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nattempts to rectify his situation were inadequate. Finally, by the time he decided to take \ncontrol of his life and active maturely, he devoted himself to his family, quit marijuana, \nand sought professional help to address his tax situation.  \n \nToday, Applicant\u2019s past federal and state tax returns are filed and he is in timely \nrepayment on his tax balances, with significant progress having been made to date. He \nhas his student loans in timely repayment, paid one debt, disputed another debt, and is \nworking on setting up a repayment plan on a modest balance of $1,133. His strategy to \naddress his financial issues is succeeding. Other than his past marijuana use \u2013 which \nhe has quit and put behind him \u2013 and his dismissal from one job six years ago, there is \nno suggestion that Applicant today is anything but a responsible and maturing family \nman. In light of all the above, I find Applicant mitigated financial considerations, \npersonal conduct, and drug involvement security concerns.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:    \n \n \nFor Applicant \n    \nParagraph 3, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n                               \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Applicant has made minimal progress in addressing his delinquent \nfinances. I conclude that he has not mitigated the psychological conditions and financial \nconditions security concern.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 20, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \n \nOn August 25, 2019, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations. He \nrequested a hearing. On November 20, 2019, the case was assigned to me, and on \nDecember 6, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case for January 23, \n2020. The hearing was held as scheduled. I received six government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE \n6), three exhibits from Applicant (AE A \u2013 AE C), and a copy of the discovery letter from \nDepartment Counsel to Applicant, dated November 7, 2019 (Hearing Exhibit I). At the close \nof the hearing, I left the record open through close of business February 7, 2020, at \nApplicant\u2019s request, to allow him the opportunity to submit additional exhibits. Applicant did \nnot submit any supplementary exhibits by the deadline, whereupon, I closed the record. \nThe transcript was received on January 31, 2020. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old single man. He was previously married from 1995 to 1999. \nThe marriage ended in divorce. He has an adult child from this relationship. Currently, he is \nengaged to his longtime girlfriend. \n`  \n \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in accounting in 2011, and he \nearned a master\u2019s degree in the same field in 2014. (Tr. 17) He has been working as a \nconsultant for an accounting firm since June 2016. (GE 1 at 11) \n \n \nIn August 2016, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend caught him cheating on her. (Answer at 5) \nApplicant had engaged in infidelity, with random strangers whom he met online, 20 to 30 \ntimes in the previous 12 months before his girlfriend discovered it. (Tr. 30) Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cfeeling of powerlessness to stop [his] behavior drove [him] to attempt\u201d suicide by ingesting \nthree bottles of prescription medicines. (Answer at 5) Fortunately, Applicant began vomiting \nimmediately after ingesting the pills, and was admitted into a ten-day inpatient psychiatric \nprogram. (Answer at 4) Upon discharge, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and \nprescribed various medications. Since then, Applicant has been attending therapy \napproximately every two weeks and seeing a psychiatrist every two months to monitor his \nmedication. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 21)) In addition, he began attending a sexual-addictions support \ngroup for his promiscuous behavior. He attended the support group meetings for \napproximately 18 months.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mental-health condition is characterized by manic behavior. (Tr. 22) \nWhen Applicant is in a manic state he becomes \u201coverly energetic\u201d and anxious, prompting \nhim to engage in impulsive behavior in an attempt to calm himself, such as promiscuous, \nrisky sex with strangers and excessive shopping. (Tr. 22, 30; GE 6 at 4) From 2002 to \n2009, Applicant drank alcohol excessively to manage his symptoms. (Tr. 22) Excessive \nalcohol consumption is no longer a problem. \n \n \nAscertaining the proper balance of medications was challenging. Specifically, if the \ndaily amount of Applicant\u2019s anti-anxiety prescription was too small, he would continue to \nexperience anxiety. Conversely, if the prescribed dosage was too high, Applicant would \n\n3 \n \nbecome depressed. Things \u201cfinally clicked\u201d for Applicant with respect to a proper balance of \nmedication approximately a year and a half ago. (Tr. 41- 42) \n \n \n \nApplicant has been taking his medication \u201creligiously, every morning and night.\u201d (Tr. \n35) His therapist taught him coping strategies for dealing with his bipolar disorder. He has \nnot cheated on his girlfriend since the 2016 episode that prompted his suicide attempt, and \nhe has not engaged in any other risky, impulsive behavior. Now, when Applicant \noccasionally experiences manic feelings, he responds by \u201chyperfocus[ing] on work and \nwalking his dog. (GE 5 at 1) His work history shows a pattern of stability. (GE 6) \n \n \nIn September 2018, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation from an \nindependent medical examiner. (GE 6) Per the psychologist, although Applicant \u201cappears \nto be on a positive trajectory in terms of remediating what has been a longstanding mental-\nhealth condition,  he still has a medical condition that could negatively impact his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness in the context of safeguarding sensitive information and \nworking in a cleared setting.\u201d(GE 6 at 6-7) Specifically, Applicant, during his consultation, \ndemonstrated limited self-awareness and only minimally monitored what he was saying, \nleading the psychologist to conclude that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] talkativeness along with residual \nimpulsivity led [the psychologist] to believe that a nefarious person could extract sensitive \ninformation from [Applicant] with little effort.\u201d (GE 6 at 6) \n \n \nApproximately a year after the psychological examination with the independent \nmedical examiner, Applicant\u2019s treating therapist prepared a report.  Applicant began \nreceiving treatment from her in April 2018 and he continued to consistently attend therapy \nsessions through August 19, 2019, when she prepared her report. (GE 5) Per the therapist, \nApplicant still experienced manic episodes; however, he was engaged in the therapy \nsessions, which focused on coping strategies for his manic and depressive symptoms. (GE \n5) Her report does not address whether his mental-health disorder could affect his ability to \nsafeguard sensitive information. \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $150,000 of delinquent debt. The majority of the debt \nconsists of delinquent income taxes ($27,730) and delinquent student loans ($119,000). \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2012 after relocating from State 1 to State 2. \nApplicant was briefly responsible for two lease payments, as his girlfriend remained in their \nState 1 residence for approximately a year until their lease expired. Shortly after Applicant \nmoved to State 2, his  ex-wife, a military member who had physical custody of their then \nteenage daughter since the divorce, was deployed abroad, prompting Applicant who had \nnever previous had physical custody of his daughter more than two weeks per year, now \nhad to assume physical custody of the daughter during his ex-wife\u2019s deployment. (Tr. 25)  \nApplicant recognized that continuing to support his girlfriend financially until she relocated \nto his new home in State 2, while at the same time taking in his daughter posed a \ntremendous financial burden; however, \u201cin [his] particular manic state, [he] felt like [he] \ncould do it all.\u201d (Tr. 25)  \n \n \nOverwhelmed, Applicant increased his income tax withholdings to generate more \ntake-home income. (Tr. 73) By 2017, he owed $15,800 in delinquent federal income taxes \n\n4 \n \nfrom tax years 2012 through 2016, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.a, and he owed \napproximately $14,000 in delinquent state income taxes. (Answer at 1) In 2017, Applicant \nbegan satisfying his federal income-tax debt through a payment plan, under which he paid \nthe IRS $220 per month. (Tr. 79) Applicant has missed half of the scheduled payments, \nand he has not made a payment in the past six months. (Tr. 80, 82) Recently, the IRS \napplied a $2,000 refund from Applicant\u2019s 2019 income tax return to the delinquency. (Tr. \n27) The current debt totals $13,575. (AE A) \n \n \nApplicant owes approximately $14,155 in delinquent state income taxes, as alleged \nin SOR subparagraph 2.b. When he researched the delinquency, he realized that he had \nnot filed his tax returns for 2012 and 2014. After he filed these returns, the tax burden was \nreduced to $7,140, as the refunds were applied to the delinquency. (Tr. 27; AE B) He then \nset up a payment plan. He has not made any payments in more than a year. (Tr. 83-84) \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.c, 2.e, 2.f, and 2.i through 2.m are \ndelinquent credit-card accounts, totaling approximately $6,200. Applicant has made no \npayments and they remain outstanding. (Tr. 88-89) These bills became delinquent in \nSeptember 2017 after Applicant \u201cdrew the line\u201d and concluded that he could not \nsimultaneously pay for mental-health treatment and meet his debt payments. (Tr. 97)  \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 2.d, totaling $2,275, is owed to a company that publishes study \nmaterials for accountants. (Tr. 86; GE 1 at 13) Applicant disputes this bill, contending that \nhis then employer was supposed to have satisfied it. (Tr. 86) He provided no evidence in \nsupport of this contention.     \n \n \nThe debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.g and 2.h are student-loan accounts. \nThey total approximately $119,000. In April 2019, Applicant entered a rehabilitation \nagreement to satisfy the loans. Under the plan, he was to pay $345 monthly for a ten-\nmonth probationary period. (Tr. 90) If Applicant were to conform to the agreement, the \ncreditor would no longer consider the loan to be in delinquent status. (Tr. 90) Applicant \nmade payments for the first three months, as agreed, but he missed the payment for \nAugust 2019. He provided evidence of a September 2019 payment, but he did not provide \nany proof that he made the payments for October through December of 2019.   \n \n \nApplicant earns $114,000 per year. (Tr. 65) He has $3,000 invested in a 401k \naccount. (Tr. 72) He has not attended any credit counseling. (Tr. 90) There is no record \nevidence that he maintains a budget.     \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n5 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied together with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n\n6 \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \n  Under this guideline, \u201ccertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can \nimpair judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 27) Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder, together with his suicide attempt in 2016, followed by an inpatient psychiatric \nhospitalization, trigger the following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional, employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n\n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s therapist concluded that, although Applicant still has manic episodes, he \nhas been learning to cope with them through therapy, which he has attended consistently. \nHis progress has also corresponded as his medication treatment regime has evolved. \nConversely, the psychologist who performed the independent medical examination \nconcluded that Applicant still has manic symptoms, which are manifested in limited self-\ncontrol, impulsivity, and excessive talkativeness. Most importantly, the psychologist \nconcluded that these residual symptoms continue to raise questions about Applicant\u2019s \nability to safeguard classified information.  \n \n \nApplicant saw the psychologist only once. In comparison, he has an ongoing \nrelationship with his therapist. In addition, the record therapist report is more recent than \nthe psychologist report. The therapist report, however, does not explicitly address the issue \nof whether Applicant\u2019s mental-health condition is under control. Consequently, although \nApplicant\u2019s progress is sufficient to conclude that his long-term prognosis is favorable as \nlong as he continues to participate in therapy, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that \nhe has no indications of a current problem. I conclude that AG \u00b6 29(a) and 29(b) apply, but \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 (c) through 29(e) do not apply. \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline are set forth under AG \u00b6 18 as \nfollows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s outstanding federal and state income tax debt triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n\n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those  \n \n \nApplicant became financially overextended in 2012 when his daughter, who had \nnever lived with him for any extended length of time, moved in with him after her mother \nwas deployed, and after he relocated and continued to support his girlfriend financially, \npaying their rent payments until she joined him in State 2. Although the situation involving \nhis daughter was arguably unexpected, the situation involving his girlfriend and his decision \nto continue paying their lease after he relocated was not unexpected. Moreover, regardless \nof whether Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he has not made adequate efforts to satisfy his debts for me to conclude that he \nacted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in credit counseling. Although he made arrangements \nto pay his income taxes and his student-loan debts, the most significant debts, he did not \nadhere to the agreements. As for the disputed debt, he provided no evidence supporting \nthe basis of his contention. Under these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s initiation of good-faith \nefforts to repay his debts is sufficient to trigger the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(d), but \nnone of the remaining mitigating conditions applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant deserves credit for taking steps to gain control of his mental-health \ncondition. He no longer engages in destructive behavior, such as compulsive, high-risk \nsexual intercourse with strangers, or heavy drinking. However, given the evaluation of the \npsychologist, it is too soon to conclude that Applicant\u2019s mental-health condition does not \npose a security concern. In reaching this decision, I was particularly cognizant of \nApplicant\u2019s testimony that he was unable to simultaneously manage his mental-health and \npay down his delinquent debts. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n9 \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nMarc E. Curry \n Administrative Judge \n",

For most of the previous 10 years, she has owed delinquent taxes \nbeginning with tax year 2007. She did not prove she was unable to timely file her tax \nreturns or make greater progress sooner on paying her tax debt. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are refuted; however, financial considerations security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.       \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 24, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On January 18, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

(GE 1) She said she was \u201cworking on putting a payment \nplan in place.\u201d (GE 1) \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s July 11, 2016 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI), Applicant said she paid the IRS $1,000 monthly and paid her tax \ndebts as follows: for tax years 2008, 2010, 2011, and 2012 she paid the taxes around \n2015; and for tax year 2013, she plans to pay this debt in August 2016.

(AE 13, AE 14 at 15-20) Her tax debt was also \nreduced due to transfers of overpayments for tax years 2008, 2012, and 2013. (AE 13) \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax transcript indicates she has a zero balance for tax year 2016, and two \nrefunds totaling $2,204 were transferred to non-IRS debts. (AE 13) The transfers to \naddress non-IRS debts are an indication that as of November 2018 all IRS debts were \npaid. (AE 13) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges the IRS filed a tax lien for $50,875 against Applicant in about \nOctober 2013. SOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a state tax authority filed a tax lien for $8,854 against \nApplicant, and SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges Applicant owes a state tax authority $17,705. On March \n4, 2019, the state tax authority indicated Applicant owed $12,390; the monthly installment \namount is $710; and the first monthly payment is due on March 15, 2019. (AE 16) On \nOctober 28, 2019, the state tax authority wrote the balance due is $40,455. (AE 17D) A \npayment plan requiring monthly payments of $1,300 for 36 months was established with \nthe first payment due on November 15, 2019. (AE 17D) \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcripts, Applicant had an adjusted gross \nincome (AGI) of more than $300,000 in four of ten of the tax years from 2007 to 2016. \n(AE 4-13) For tax year 2007, she said she was sued by another company based on an \nallegation of non-compete, and \u201ctrying to defend that ate up most of\u201d her $1,110,000 \nincome in 2007. (Tr. 24) Her taxable income for 2007 was $1,058,000. (AE 4) She \nexplained that she could not utilize all of the funds indicated in her AGI on her federal \nincome tax returns because she used the funds to make payroll, and she does not have \na line of credit. (Tr. 23) She did not provide documentation showing the funds spent for \nlitigation or payroll. For tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012, she had negative income \nbecause she was starting a new company. (Tr. 29) Applicant\u2019s current budget indicates \nshe has sufficient income to pay her tax debts. (AE 17A)  \n \nApplicant described her tax issues as an anomalous period in her life that she has \nresolved, except for the two payment plans with the IRS and state tax authority. (Tr. 33) \nShe has never been arrested or convicted. (Tr. 33; GE 1) She passed a DOD lifestyle \npolygraph. (Tr. 33) She has built a profitable company and provided important support to \nthe U.S. Government. She assured her tax problems will not recur. (Tr. 33)      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d She filed her federal tax returns \nwithin the extension periods for tax years 2007, 2008, 2013, 2015, and 2016. She did not \nhave any income for tax years 2011 and 2012, and no income taxes were indicated on \nher IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2011 and 2012. She may not have been required to \nfile a federal tax return for those two years. See IRS Publication 501, Dependents, \nStandard Deduction, and Filing Information. Three of her tax returns were not timely filed: \nher tax return for tax year 2009 was filed on February 28, 2011; her tax return for tax year \n2010 was filed on April 20, 2013; and her tax return for tax year 2014 was filed on May \n31, 2016.  \n \n  \nApplicant did not pay her federal income taxes when due for tax years 2007, 2008, \n2009, 2013, 2015, and 2016. The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Applicant, two of her \nbrothers, and her mother had serious medical problems which resulted in substantial \nmedical bills. She was sued and left her corporation, and she did not earn any income for \nthree years. These are circumstances partially or fully beyond her control that adversely \naffected her finances. However, these circumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant is credited with mitigating SOR \nallegation \u00b6 1.e because she did not owe delinquent taxes for tax year 2010; and SOR \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j because the two tax liens were included in her other SOR tax \ndebts.  \n \nApplicant did not timely file her state and federal income tax returns for tax years \n2009, 2010, and 2014. According to the January 12, 2018 tax transcripts for tax years \n2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2016, Applicant owed taxes for those six tax years \nuntil 2018.  She did not establish that she was unable to timely file her tax returns and to \nmake greater progress sooner paying her tax debts.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege she did not pay her federal taxes in full when due \nfor tax year 2018, and she currently has a tax debt of $54,889. SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges a state \ntax debt for $17,705, and on October 28, 2019, the state tax authority wrote the balance \ndue is $40,455. The SOR does not allege her incorrect statement to the OPM investigator \nabout the status of her tax debts. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR \nmay be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n  \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile her federal income tax returns against her as a federal crime. In regard to the failure \nto timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has \ncommented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies in part because she paid all of her delinquent federal income taxes \nexcept for tax year 2018. She has payment plans to address her state and federal tax \ndebts. However, the timing of her payments of her delinquent taxes are an important \naspect of the analysis. Even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal \nBoard provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security \nclearance: \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). In ISCR Case \nNo. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the grant of a \nsecurity clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to timely file \nher tax returns for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2014. She did not establish she was unable \nto make greater progress resolving her delinquent tax debts sooner. She has a $54,889 \nfederal tax debt for tax year 2018, and a state tax debt of $40,455. She did not provide \nproof of any payments to address these two debts in 2019. There are not clear indications \nher financial problems are under control. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 16 includes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j, specifically, that \nApplicant failed to timely file her state and federal tax returns for tax years 2007 through \n2016. She failed to timely file her federal and state tax returns for tax years 2009, 2010, \nand 2014. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established because the failure to timely file her tax returns \nfor tax years 2009, 2010, and 2014 are alleged and fully addressed under Guideline F. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is not established because filing three state and federal tax returns late more \nthan three years ago is not sufficiently embarrassing or derogatory to affect her personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. It is also significant that all taxes were paid for those \nthree years. She has refuted SOR \u00b6 2.a as a security concern.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines E and \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nF are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 61 years old, and she owns a corporation which provides engineering \ninformation technology services to the federal government. Her corporation employs \nabout 20 people, and the gross revenue is about $3 million dollars annually. She has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in business administration with a minor in computer science and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in business administration with a focus on technical communications. \nApplicant, two of her brothers, and her mother have had serious medical problems. She \nprovided financial support for her three brothers, one sister, and her mother, who has \ndementia. She was focused on building her companies. Applicant made substantial \ncontributions to her companies and the national defense. There is no evidence of security \nviolations. \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nThe primary problems here relate to Applicant\u2019s handling of her federal and state \nincome taxes.

She may not have fully understood or appreciated the importance of these \nrequirements in terms of her access to classified information. She did not establish she \nwas unable to make greater progress sooner resolving her tax issues. Her actions under \nthe Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about [her] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant refuted personal \nconduct security concerns; however, unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He provided sufficient evidence \nin explanation and mitigation resolving the use of information technology and personal \nconduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline M, use of information technology, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him.  \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 23, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). (SOR Response) On March 21, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on April 11, 2019.  \n \nEleven Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 11) and one Applicant exhibit (Ex. A) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection at the hearing. Applicant testified, as reflected in \na transcript (Tr.) received on April 19, 2019, as did a government witness, Applicant\u2019s \nformer employer, and a coworker. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he admitted he had been terminated in 2011 from his \nthen employment for a computer-use violation (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant denied he violated \nhis administrative privileges as a systems administrator between April 2012 and \nSeptember 2014(SOR \u00b6 1.b); denied he permanently disabled anti-intrusion software on \nhis workstation(SOR \u00b6 1.b.i.); denied placing his workstation in any elevated category \ngroups within an active directory (SOR \u00b6 1.b.ii.); denied modifying his system \nconfiguration to violate security requirements (SOR \u00b6 1.b.iii.); and denied violating his \naccess privileges by accessing websites with inappropriate content, or uploading images \nof women in violation of the Acceptable Use Policy (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.c.i.). He admitted \nhis access to classified information was suspended in March 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) for the \nalleged violations of administrative and access privileges, but he was told only that there \nhad been \u201csuspicious activity.\u201d He denied being involved in conduct of questionable \njudgment under Guideline E, personal conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2 and 2.a). He denied falsifying \nfacts on his May 4, 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) \nwhen he stated he left his employment in August 2011 due to end of contract and was \nreleased from the contract under mutual agreement (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He denied he had failed \nto disclose on his July 31, 2017 e-QIP the full extent of his August employment \ntermination. (SOR \u00b6 2.c). (Ex. 3, 4) After considering the pleading, exhibits, and transcript, \nI make the following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old information technology (IT) support specialist who has \nworked for a defense contractor since June 2017 and seeks to obtain a security \nclearance. (Ex. 5) From May 1999 through August 2003, he honorably served in the U.S. \nMarine Corps. (Ex. 4) In July 2009, he married, and in June 2016, he divorced. (Ex. 4) He \nhas two children, a son age 14 and a daughter age 11. (Ex. 4) His confidential clearance \neligibility was granted in May 1999, and suspended in March 2015. (Ex. 4, 5)  \nOn August 22, 2011, Applicant was terminated from his employment with a \ntechnology company when he plugged a hard drive into a government computer, which \nheld inappropriate content. (Ex. 6) He stated, \n \n\n \n3 \nin August of 2011 there was a lapse of judgment and I made a mistake and \nit was an isolated incident. It was not malicious in nature and under no \ncircumstance was it meant to be a security breach or anything that would \nendanger the government system. It was a simple lack of judgment which \ncost me employment. (Tr. 12) \n \nApplicant explained that he provided IT support to friends not part of his \ngovernment job. His barber gave him an external hard drive to check if it was functional \nbecause it would not boot up. (Tr. 99, SOR Response) Instead of waiting to take the hard \ndrive home to test it, he plugged it into his work computer. When he discovered the \ncontents of the hard drive, he immediately unplugged it, but his action was a security \nviolation. He acknowledges his actions were shortsighted and thoughtless. (SOR \nResponse) He says there was \u201cno excuse or justification for [his] unethical act,\u201d but \nasserts this action was not characteristic of how he handled business before or after the \nincident. (SOR Response) He stated, \u201cI do freely admit that it was an error, a lapse in \njudgment, and I did plug into a hard drive.\u201d (Tr. 83) This was his first offense at the \ncompany. (Tr. 84) He testified, \u201cit was a lapse of judgment which I\u2019m not running away \nfrom it. This was back in 2011, and since then, of course, I\u2019ve mitigated that and I\u2019m very \nmindful and very paranoid\u201d about during security access. (Tr. 87) He asserts he was very \ncandid about the incident during both his Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterviews. (Tr. 87) \n  \nThe day after Applicant connected the hard drive, his violation was detected, and \nApplicant was told not to return to work. (SOR Response) When confronted by his \nemployer, he acknowledged his mistake and did not make or offer any excuse for the \nincident. The company was in the midst of a contract extension and re-bid of the contract \nand he was told it was best that he be separated. (Tr. 86, SOR Response) He was told \nhe would not be given a second chance because the contract was ending, and retaining \nhim after the security incident might hurt the company\u2019s chance of obtaining the contract. \n(Tr. 87) \n  \nApplicant disclosed on his January 2012 e-QIP and again on his July 2017 e-QIP, \nthat he had left his job in August 2011 by mutual agreement following allegations of \nmisconduct. On both e-QIPs, he fully explained that he had plugged in a hard drive on his \nwork computer to test it. He stated that his then employer\u2019s Network Operations Center \n(NOC) had discovered the incident. He indicated that his actions were a security violation \nand stated, \n \nMy company was in the midst of recompete efforts with [a government \nagency]. This would look bad for my old employer\u2019s desire for recompete. It \nwas decided that it would be best if I were [sic] removed from the contract \nfor that reason. I was told it was a result of bad timing as opposed to the \nviolation itself. I understood violation and my employment with [the \ncompany] ended. (Ex. 1, Ex. 4) \n \n\n \n4 \nIn Applicant\u2019s January 31, 2012, Declaration for Federal Employment to work as a \ncontract systems administrator for the U.S. military, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 12 that \nasked if, during the previous five years, he had been fired from any job for any reason, \nquit after being told that he would be fired, or left by mutual agreement because of specific \nproblems. He explained he left his previous employer after mutual agreement after he \nhad plugged a personal external hard drive into his work computer. He stated the incident \nwas deemed a security violation and, due to the timing of the incident, his employment \nended. He explained the contract he was working on was ending and the company was \nin negotiations to bid on a new contract. (Ex. 2) He asserts he had no intention to be \ndishonest or have a lack of candor. (Tr. 88) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s May 2015 e-QIP, he answered \u201cno\u201d to all employment questions \nconcerning being fired, quitting after being told he would be fired, leaving by mutual \nagreement following allegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance, or having \nreceived a written warning, reprimand, suspension, or discipline for misconduct in the \nwork place. (Ex. 3) He gave as the reason for his employment ending in August 2011, \n\u201cEnd of contract. Released from Contract under mutual agreement.\u201d (Ex. 3)  \n \nWhen asked about it during his OPM interviews, he told the investigators that his \nanswer was a mistake and he should have answered \u201cyes\u201d to the questions on the e-QIP. \n(Tr. 107) He asserts he was candid throughout the investigation, with the OPM \ninvestigators, and during his hearing, and he was not deceptive or malicious. (Tr. 178) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s July 2017 e-QIP, he provided a long explanation for his termination. \n(Ex. 4) He fully explained that his employment ended because he had plugged a hard \ndrive into his government computer, which was discovered by the NOC. He explained his \nemployer said it would look bad as the company was competing for an extension of the \ncontract, and it would be better if he was removed from the contract. (Ex. 4) The company \ndid not create an unfavorable information file (UIF) on the incident. (Tr. 135) He is \nremorseful about the incident. (Tr. 189) Before his initial hiring as a contractor in support \nof the U.S. military, Applicant told his prospective employer what occurred at his previous \nemployment. (Tr. 134) The company checked it out and, according to Applicant, his \nprevious employer related the same information Applicant had provided. (Tr. 134) The \ncontractor at JTFB would not have hired Applicant had his previous employer \nrecommended he not be hired. (Tr. 136)  \n \nFrom April 2012 until September 2014, Applicant worked as a contractor in support \nof the U.S. military at an overseas government location. (Ex. 5) He was employed along \nwith 17 or 18 other U.S. computer technicians; the prime contractor had an additional 24 \nto 25 U.S. computer technicians; and the host country had an equal number of \ntechnicians. (Tr. 146) The prime contractor dealt with computers and communications. \n(Tr. 148)  \n \nApplicant initially worked in computer-desktop support before being promoted to \njunior systems administrator. (Tr. 75) He was promoted after other employees were \nterminated due to inappropriate actions. (Tr. 75) He was promoted to the NOC as a novice \n\n \n5 \nlearning the job. (Tr. 76) His duties were to create and delete email accounts, to monitor \nthe email server, to conduct morning security checks, and to operate the mail server. (Tr. \n77, Tr. 94, SOR Answer) Daily and weekly scans were conducted of all computers, and \nevery computer was required to have HBSS (host-based security system) and HIPS \n(host-based intrusion prevention system) software on them. (Tr. 94) Applicant had no \nknowledge about HIPS and no motivation to learn about HIPS. (Tr. 81) The HBSS was \nthe software responsible for implementation of anti-intrusion tools and auditing. (SOR \nAnswer) \n \nHBSS and HIPS, which are designed for security over host-based systems dealing \nwith intrusion and infections are dealt with at the individual workstation level, are particular \nto U.S. Government networks. (Tr. 67) HBSS and HIPS prevent plugging in a hard drive \nthrough a USB port. (Tr. 31) If HBSS was not installed on a workstation the systems \nadministrators had to answer to the information assurance (IA) administrator. (Tr. 94) \n \nIn 2014, a civilian contractor at Applicant\u2019s worksite was arrested and subsequently \nconvicted of espionage, child pornography, and child-sex crimes, among other crimes. \n(Tr. 53, 132) Around the same time, another civilian contractor was also fired and arrested \nfor criminal activity. (Tr. 16, 42) When these individuals were removed, Applicant was \ngiven a promotion to work in the NOC. (Tr. 96) \n \nAs part of the FBI\u2019s investigation into the criminal conduct of the arrested \ncontractors, the government witness, a cyber-security advisor (investigator), conducted \nan onsite network security evaluation and checked the IT system for additional problems. \n(Tr. 69), His findings are listed in Ex. 7. (Tr. 41) He looked for \u201cback doors,\u201d and removed \nany pornography that was still on the network. (Tr. 17, 41) He reviewed and pulled \ninformation from over 600 machines on the Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router (NIPR) \nnetwork. (Tr. 18) He was onsite for a week or more doing his inspection. (Tr. 70)  \n \nThe investigator\u2019s findings from the June 2014 investigation were set forth in a \nSeptember 9, 2014 email. (Ex.7) It was asserted that Applicant and a co-worker, both \nsystems administrators, had disabled anti-intrusion tools on their workstations and \ninformation servers on the network they operated; there was improper placement of their \nworkstations into elevated category groups within the directory, which would allow the two \nadministrators to communicate unimpeded between workstations and servers while using \nthe same network account, which violated Defense Information Security Agency (DISA) \nSecurity Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs); and Applicant\u2019s NIPR workstation \nhad accessed websites, which contained content that included hate groups and other \nsites in violation of the IT system\u2019s use policy.  \n \nThe investigator testified that his job was simply to collect the information, identify \nthe issues, and present them. (Tr. 65) He explained that if the anti-virus or HBSS were \noff, there would be a logo on the monitor with a red \u201cX\u201d showing the items were disabled. \n(Tr. 66) The investigator discovered that Applicant\u2019s domain administrator account was \nalso added to the local administrator\u2019s group, which would allow Applicant to make \nchanges directly to his local machine as well as to servers and computers on the domain \n\n \n6 \nas well. (Tr. 26) The investigator stated Applicant\u2019s account was never in the work station, \nbut was in the server and should not have been there. (Tr. 167) The investigator stated, \n\u201cI can\u2019t tell or see if he did it, however, it was in there and he had the accesses that would \nhave allowed for that.\u201d (Tr. 167-168) \n \nDuring the course his investigation, the investigator provided daily updates to the \ncommand. (Tr. 70) An out-briefing was given to the command listing all critical issues \nbefore the investigator left the installation. (Tr. 67) Any major issues or major findings \nwere provided in an executive summary. (Tr. 68) About 80 percent of the information is \ngiven on site. (Tr. 60) The information is provided to criminal investigators to determine if \nanything illegal had occurred. (Tr. 68) After the information is collected it is reviewed and \nreferenced against known bad lists, reviewed for malware and nation-state activity, and \nhe then writes up a large report that goes into much more detail, which can sometimes \ntake two months. (Tr. 50, 60) The investigator prepared a report that was based on events \nthat occurred before the June 2014 inspection of the IT system that led to the discovery \nof Applicant\u2019s workstation in the elevated category group within the directory. A copy of \nthe investigator\u2019s went to the criminal investigator and the director of security at the \nworksite. (Tr. 71) The report was based on events prior to the June 2014 inspection. The \nApplicant\u2019s removal from the installation occurred three months after the investigation \nwas completed, in September 2014. (Tr. 63)  \n \nIn September 2014, three months after the investigator completed his \ninvestigation, Applicant and a co-worker were told they had been reported for \u201csuspicious \nactivity.\u201d Applicant was removed from the installation, although he asserts he was never \ngiven any specifics as to the basis of the allegations or what the \u201csuspicious activity\u201d \ninvolved. Applicant and his employer made numerous requests to obtain information on \nthe alleged incidents. (Ex. 9) Six months after he left the country, he and his employer \nstill had not been told the nature of the alleged misconduct. (Tr. 79) He learned some \ndetails through a Freedom of Information Act request. (Tr. 80)  \n \nRegarding allegations that Applicant had disabled the anti-intrusion tools (Tr. 30), \nthe event logs show the HBSS and HIPS were disabled multiple times. (Tr. 32) The IA \ngovernment administrator was the only person who had the ability to disable the HBSS. \n(Tr. 168) The investigator stated having an account at the local administrator level would \nallow Applicant to access HBSS and disable the anti-intrusion tools. (Tr. 169)  \n \n \nA cyber-security advisor (investigator) testified for the government at Applicant\u2019s \nhearing. He asserted, and Applicant disagreed, that a local administrator such as the \nApplicant, had the ability to turn off and manipulate programs on specific machines. (Tr. \n55) The AI administrator would call and say he wanted to turn the programs back on and \nApplicant told him \u201cno.\u201d Applicant\u2019s employer disagrees with this statement, stating the AI \nadministrator was responsible and had the authority to correct any violation of the \nDefense Information Systems Agency (DISA) standards. (Tr. 139) The investigator \ntestified that the administrators started disabling the security programs themselves. (Tr. \n55) There were daily and weekly scans performed by the AI administrator to make sure \nHBSS was on all machines except for two administrator machines and one or two servers, \n\n \n7 \nwhich included Applicant\u2019s machine. (Tr. 48) When asked by Applicant about logs \nshowing he had been the person to disable the HBSS and HIPS, the investigator stated \n\u201cSo it\u2019s going to be tough for me to really identify but you had the access and ability.\u201d (Tr. \n63) \n \nApplicant had a personal account and three separated administrative accounts \nwhich maintained 12 servers. His computer was on the NIPR network. As part of his \nduties, he would occasionally have to access a Secret Internet Protocol Router (SIPR) \ncomputer to create and delete accounts. He never had a computer or workstation on the \nSIPR network. (Tr. 90, SOR Answer) There was a centralized SIPR computer that was \naccessed by all systems administrators. (Tr. 90) Applicant testified that the HBSS and \nsecurity breaches were said to be on the SIPR network. (Tr. 90)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at the time of Applicant\u2019s alleged violations, the technical \nlead and desktop supervisor and manager, said he does not believe Applicant had the \nknowledge or experience to disable HBSS or to place his machine in a higher category \nof access. He said he was \u201can outstanding desktop tech but you [Applicant] was a junior \nsys admin, at best, so from my assessment, I don\u2019t think that you had the skill set to pull \nthat part off.\u201d (Tr. 156) \u201cThat\u201d being the violations asserted such as disabling HBSS and \nplacing his machine in a higher category of access. He testified Applicant was always \nreliable and a stellar desktop technician, but when he moved to the NOC, he was new \nand green, and it would take time for him to learn his job. He stated, \u201cSo the things he \nwas being accused to do, it just didn\u2019t make sense with his skill set.\u201d (Tr. 160) He said it \nwould not have given any value added for Applicant to take the initiative to try to \ncircumvent security protocols or do something on a high-end server. (Tr. 163) Any \nproblems with information assurance and HBSS would have been handled by Applicant\u2019s \nmanagement and not by Applicant. (Tr. 162) \n \nApplicant asserts he never placed his account on any elevated or restricted group. \n(Tr. 78) He denied he had ever scanned his machine to determine the extent of his access \nrights. (Tr. 187) Whenever he had to perform a task requiring elevated rights, he had to \nhave the assistance of more senior personnel. If he was helping a user who needed to \nget on an approved website, a website that had initially been flagged, he would have to \ncontact the information assurance (IA) administrator to have the HBSS disabled. (Tr. 77, \n121) The IA had a specific duty as the HBSS administrator to maintain the HBSS. (Tr. \n139) Applicant acknowledged he believed there were personal problems between him \nand the IA administrator. (Tr. 83) The IA worked for the primary contractor and not \nApplicant\u2019s employer. (Tr. 149) Following the inspection, the IA administrator was \nterminated from his position before Applicant was removed from the installation. (Tr. 78) \n \nApplicant had been told he would be trained in how to operate the Domain Name \nSystem (DNS) by a senior systems administrator. However, he was never trained in the \nsystem and he never logged onto the system. (Tr. 80) He does not know if, by being \nselected to be trained to operate the DNS server, he had been elevated for inclusion in \nan elevated category. Someone with authorization had moved him to the restricted \n\n \n8 \norganizational unit (OU). He had no idea that he was in an elevated category or who \nplaced him in an elevated category. (Tr. 122)  \n \nApplicant denies ever having the necessary access to make any changes to \nconfigure or disable anti-intrusion tools. (Ex. 10) Those tools were administered by the IA \ndepartment. He stated he had no knowledge of how to configure or manipulate intrusion \ntools. Nor did he have the knowledge to disable security settings without assistance. (Ex. \n10) Prior to the annual DISA inspection in July 2014, the same account served as his \nadministrator\u2019s and user\u2019s account. (Ex. 10) After being told that to comply with new \nsecurity measures, multiple accounts were needed. At that time, old accounts were \ndisabled, and he was issued three administrator accounts. The reason for the security \nmeasure was to prohibit unimpeded communication between workstations and \ncomputers. He was not instrumental and did not take part in the creation of the new \naccounts. Nor was he involved in the placement of these accounts in any specific-security \ncategory group. (Ex. 10) The accounts were created by the AI office. If the accounts or \nworkstations were placed in the wrong security category, it was done without his \nknowledge, as he had nothing to do with the creation or placement of these accounts. \n(Ex. 10) The only personnel who could place a workstation in an elevated status was an \nadministrator account possessed by the NOC supervisor or AI personnel.  \n \nThe president of the company onsite in 2014 stated in an April 9, 2015 email that \nthe HBSS software had incorrect settings and had improper setup policies that prevented \nrequested and required software from being installed. Due to the HBSS, incorrect settings \nand policies, all software that had utilized the directory would fail immediately, which \nincluded patches, flash patches, and Windows security updates, all of which were \nrequired to be installed. Disabling and re-enabling the software occurred regularly. The \ndesktop support and systems administrators were prevented by the incorrect settings and \npolicies from making the network safer by installing required security updates to the \nnetwork. If the software was not temporarily disabled by the AI administrator, many of the \ncomputers on the network would not have been properly patched. (Ex. 9) Applicant \nalways requested assistance from the AI administrator whenever he had to have the \nHBSS turned off. \n \nThe company\u2019s president also said there were no cyber-incident reports filed, \nwhich would have included log files, dates of proven incidents, login records, and \nadditional information that would show illegal software or illegitimate reasons for disabling \nsoftware in order to install required software and then re-enable the software. (Ex. 9) The \nHBSS failed the July 2014 DISA inspection due to improperly implemented policies and \nlack of training and policy templates that could have easily prevented the need to disable \nthe software in order to install all other forms of software, patches, and security updates. \n(Ex. 9)  \n \nAfter his removal from the jobsite, Applicant stayed at the overseas location from \nSeptember until November 2014, hoping to get the matter resolved and return to work. \n(Ex. 5) He eventually found out that his clearance had been flagged for misuse of \nunauthorized access and compromising government security. (Ex. 5) He contacted the \n\n \n9 \nInspector General (IG) for the Defense Security Services (DSS) and was told his \nclearance was pending, and he should wait for resolution of the investigation. In May \n2016, Applicant contacted his congressman in an attempt to resolve the issue. The \ninvestigation was adjudicated in April 2017. (Ex. 5) Although his clearance is suspended, \nthe original contractor he worked for at JTBF is still sponsoring his clearance application. \n(Ex. 5)  \n \nRegarding the hate-group content that was on his machine in 2014, Applicant \nexplained that, from December 2007 to August 2011, he worked as a contractor for a \nfederal law enforcement agency. In 2008 or 2009, while he was on temporary duty (TDY) \nin Washington DC, he met a coworker who was working for the same agency. The \ncoworker needed work done on his computer. (Tr. 91, Tr. 114) Applicant helped him with \nhis computer problem and told the individual he could contact him if he had additional \ncomputer problems. Applicant did not associate with the individual and they were not \nfriends. (Tr. 126) In January 2014, while overseas, Applicant learned the individual had \nfounded a web site that was considered a hate site. The individual was later charged with \noperating a hate group. (Ex. 5) When Applicant learned the individual had been arrested \nhe went to various sites to learn about the individual and about the arrest. (Tr. 113) He \nmade the searches to learn about the individual. (Tr. 127) Applicant stated he had never \naccessed any hate group or had knowingly associated with any hate group members. \n \nIt was alleged Applicant\u2019s computer also had a large cache of hundreds of pictures \nof women that were cataloged and detailed by type and other attributes, which was not \ncriminally illegal in nature, but did violate NIPR use policy. (Ex. 7, Ex. 8) Applicant denies \nthe allegations. (Ex. 10) He asserts he never accessed a website with content that \nviolated the acceptable use policy. (SOR Answer) He never received either a verbal or \nwritten notification by his supervisor of inappropriately accessing websites. He had photos \non his computer, but the pictures were not unacceptable nor a violation of what is \npublically deemed acceptable violating the acceptable use policy. (SOR Answer) He also \ndenies there were hundreds of pictures. \n \nThe investigator testified most of the pictures of women appeared to come from \nFacebook and none were pornographic. (Tr. 37) Applicant stated all photographs came \nfrom Facebook and did not violate the terms of his computer use. (Tr. 89) There were \nover 100 photos of women on Applicant\u2019s workstation, which was not illegal, but the \ninvestigator asserts were against policy. (Tr. 38) The investigator had reviewed a few of \nthe photos. (Tr. 58) He said \u201cI only looked into a few to see enough that I needed to see.\u201d \n(Tr. 166) The investigator did not review all of the files. (Tr. 65) One photo he viewed \nreportedly was of a topless woman bending over a motorcycle. (Tr. 58) There were no \nzone identifiers of those files, and the investigator stated they \u201cprobably could\u201d have come \nfrom Facebook. (Tr. 59) The photos were not shown to be pornographic. (Tr. 39) These \nphotos were under the Applicant\u2019s user profile. (Tr. 39) It was alleged the photos were \norganized into different folders. (Tr. 56) Applicant states there were no more than three \nfolders, asserts all photos came from Facebook, and none contained nudity. (Tr. 125) He \nsays Facebook had filters that prevent such nude photographs. (Tr. 116) He vehemently \ndenied any intention to view pornographic images. (Tr. 82) \n\n \n10 \n \nApplicant asserts all the pictures came from Facebook and public profiles and were \nnot pornographic. (Tr. 81) He stated, \n \nI vehemently dispute the willingness to look at anything pornographic, \nanything illegal or anything of that nature that I felt would violate the terms \nof use. Those were public profile pictures, and none of which were \npornographic. (Tr. 82)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s September 2017 enhanced subject interview, he stated he \ndiscovered through a FOIA response that he was suspected of disabling intrusion tools, \nwhich granted his workstation improper placement on elevated category groups. During \nthe interview, he stated he had no knowledge of how to configure his machine, did not \nhave rights to alter his software, and did not have access to carry out the task. (Ex. 5) He \nsaid he did not know what happened, and was not involved in any way. In his June 2016 \nand September 2017 interviews, he indicated his clearance had been suspended. The \nsuspension was discussed in his June 2016 interview. (Ex. 5)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer was given very little information about what happened and \nnever had a chance to actually look at the evidence, make a response to it, or provide an \nexplanation. (Tr. 132) Although as a junior employee Applicant had the least \nresponsibility, he was listed as backup on organizational charts because every position \nrequired a second systems administrator to be listed for every server or function. (Tr. 137) \nHis employer attests Applicant was still learning did not have the skill set and knowledge \nto perform many systems administrator tasks. (Tr. 137)  \n \nCharacter Information \n \n \nThe president of the company for which Applicant worked as a contractor in 2014 \nstated Applicant \u201cwas professional, competent, honest, and showed no signs of being a \nsecurity risk. From what we have been able to learn thus far about the alleged security \nincident, it is our opinion that he is not guilty of the accusations. . .\u201d (SOR Answer) He \ntestified the actions listed in the incident summary would have been out of character for \nApplicant and impossible for Applicant to execute based on the level of access Applicant \nhad in his position as junior systems administrator. The incident report disregards that \ncertain network security tools were disabled by senior systems administrators with full \nknowledge of the U.S. military, local IA staff, and DISA inspectors due to technical \nproblems with the government network. (SOR Answer) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager and direct supervisor from 2015 through 2017 are of the \nopinion Applicant was a truly valuable asset. He showed himself to be honest, \ndependable, and incredibly hard-working. He was an impressive problem solver who was \nalways able to address complex and challenging issues with confidence. (SOR Answer) \nHe has never improperly handled any company equipment or sensitive information. He \nwas not written up or disciplined for any behavior. The manager stated Applicant was a \n\n \n11 \ntrue team player, a joy to work with, and a dedicated and knowledgeable employee. (SOR \nAnswer) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor overseas during his work for the U.S. military stated \nApplicant was always extremely detail-oriented and never mishandled classified \ninformation, sensitive data, or customer\u2019s Personally Identifiable Information (PII). He \nnever received a single customer complaint about Applicant. (Ex. A) Applicant was a \ntrusted and well-valued member of the team. Given the opportunity, he would hire \nApplicant without reservation as well as recommend him for other IT positions, either \ncivilian, contractor, or federal. (Ex. A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n12 \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUse of Information Technology \n \nAG \u00b6 39 articulates the security concern for use of information technology: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying including: \n \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or denial of \naccess to, an information technology system or any data in such a system; \n \n(c) use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access \nto another system or to a compartmented area within the same system; \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized; \n \n\n \n13 \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information technology \nthat persists despite counseling by management; and \n \n(h) any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or negligent, \nthat results in damage to the national security. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant was terminated in August 2011 for plugging an \nunauthorized hard drive into a government computer in 2011, without authorization. This \nwas a violation of IT policies and procedures. SOR \u00b6 1.b asserts Applicant violated his \nadministrative privileges on the SIPR and NIPR networks. It is alleged Applicant \npermanently disabled anti-intrusion tools on his workstation, improperly placed his \nworkstation into elevated category groups within the directory, and modified his system \nconfiguration to violate and obfuscate security requirements and auditing. SOR \u00b6 1.c \nalleges Applicant repeatedly accessed websites with content in violation of the \nAcceptable Use Policy and improperly loaded pictures of women on his workstation. SOR \n\u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant\u2019s access to classified information was suspended on March 27, \n2015. \n \nRegarding the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, the government investigator \ntestified that Applicant had been placed in an elevated category group, but that he did not \nknow who had placed Applicant in the group. He could not say if it had been done by \nApplicant. There were no Cyber Incident reports filed, which would have included log files, \ndates of proven incidents, login records, and additional information showing illegal \nsoftware or illegitimate reasons for disabling software in order to install required software \nand then re-enable the software. Applicant asserts he never placed his account on any \nrestricted group and never scanned his machine to determine what access he had. \n \nWhenever he had to perform a task requiring elevated rights, he obtained the \nassistance of more senior personnel. He would contact the IA administrator when the \nHBSS had to be disabled. The IA administrator\u2019s duty was to maintain the HBSS. \n \nA senior systems administrator had told Applicant he would be trained in how to \noperate the DNS. However, Applicant was never trained in the system and never logged \nonto the system. He posited that maybe his selection to be trained had resulted in him \nbeing placed in other categories. Someone with authorization had elevated him to the \nrestricted organizational unit. He has no idea that he was in an elevated category or who \nplaced him in that category.  \n \nApplicant always requested assistance from the AI administrator whenever he had \nto have the HBSS turned off. He asserted he did not have the knowledge, administrative \nrights, or the technical skills necessary to modify system configurations to disable the \nHBSS. Applicant\u2019s supervisor at the time, the technical lead and desktop supervisor and \nmanager, said Applicant was an outstanding desktop technician, but was a junior systems \nadministrator and did not have the skill to make the changes Applicant was accused of in \nthe SOR. He indicated Applicant was always reliable and a stellar desktop technician, but \nwhen promoted to the NOC, he was new and green and it would take time for him to learn \n\n \n14 \nhis job. He said disabling the HBSS would not have given any value added for Applicant \nto take the initiative to try to circumvent security protocols or do something on a high-end \nserver. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer testified the conduct alleged in the SOR would have been out \nof character for Applicant and impossible for Applicant to execute based on the level of \naccess Applicant had in his position as junior systems administrator. Additionally, he \ntestified the incident report by the government investigator disregards that certain network \nsecurity tools were disabled by senior systems administrators with full knowledge of the \nU.S. military, local IA staff, and DISA inspectors due to technical problems with the \ngovernment network. \n \nApplicant vehemently disputes any intention or willingness to view anything \npornographic, anything illegal, or anything of the nature that would violate the terms of \nthe Acceptable Use Policy. He asserts the photos found on his workstation were public \nprofile pictures, and none of which were pornographic. The government investigator \nconceded that he had only looked at a few of the pictures and conceded the pictures \ncould have come from Facebook and were not illegal to have on Applicant\u2019s computer. \nThis was not a violation of the Acceptable Use Policy.  \n \nWhile working for a previous employer in Washington D.C., Applicant met a \ncoworker working for the same agency who had computer problems. Applicant helped \nhim with his computer problems. They were not friends. When Applicant later learned the \nindividual had been arrested for operating a hate site, he went to various sites to learn \nabout what the individual was doing. His searches for information were not a violation of \nthe Acceptable Use Policy.  \n \nI find the statements of Applicant, his former supervisor, and former employer to \nbe credible. Applicant had access at an elevated level, but there is no evidence he put \nhimself in the elevated group. Anti-intrusion tools were turned off, but Applicant had no \nability to do so, and former supervisor said there was no advantage for Applicant to do \nso. The allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.c) made under the use of information \ntechnology guideline are not substantiated. Even if the allegations were not \nunsubstantiated, they would be mitigated under AG \u00b6 41(a), infra. The alleged conduct \nwas not recent. \n \nAG \u00b6 41 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n \n\n \n15 \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a asserts Applicant was terminated from his employment eight years ago. \nApplicant admits he plugged the hard drive into his government computer resulting in his \ntermination. He freely admitted his error and discussed the events and termination in both \nhis OPM interviews. He listed it on his January 2012 e-QIP, his January 2012 Declaration \nof Federal Employment, and his July 2017 e-QIP. He told his prospective employer about \nit when he applied for the overseas position. His employer contacted the other company \nand was told the incident occurred as Applicant had explained it. He said it was a lapse \nof judgment, that it was a mistake, and was an isolated incident. Applicant testified that it \nwas not malicious in nature and under no circumstance was it meant to be a security \nbreach or anything that would endanger the government system. It was a simple lack of \njudgment which cost him employment.  \n \nApplicant acknowledges his actions involving the hard drive were shortsighted and \nthoughtless and that there was no excuse or justification for his unethical act. The action \nwas not characteristic of how he handled business before or after the incident. This was \nhis first offense at the company, and he testified he was not running away from it. When \nconfronted, he acknowledged his mistake and did not make or offer an excuse for the \nincident.  \n \nThe action is mitigated under AG \u00b6 41 (a). So much time has elapsed since the \nbehavior happened that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s response on his May 4, 2015 e-QIP to the employment \ninquiries regarding the reason why his employment ended in August 2011, following \ndisqualifying condition potentially applies: \n \n\n \n16 \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nany of the following potentially applicable factors in AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges under the personal conduct guideline the same conduct \nalleged under the use of information technology guideline. The misuse of a government \ncomputer is explicitly covered under Guideline M. As previously discussed under the use  \nof information technology guideline, Applicant did not violate his administrative privileges, \ndid not modify his system configuration, did not place his workstation in an elevated \ncategory group, and did not use his workstation to violate the Acceptable Use Policy. He \nrefuted the security concerns in that regard. The mitigating factors in \u00b6 17.f. applies to the \nallegations in \u00b6 1. b and \u00b6 1.c. The conduct in allegation in \u00b6 1.a occurred more than eight \nand a half years ago and has not been repeated. He exhibited reform by admitting his \n\n \n17 \nmistake and fully acknowledging his actions. I conclude that conduct is unlikely to recur. \nIt is mitigated under \u00b6 17.d.  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s May 2015 e-QIP, he indicated he left his job in August 2011 due to \nend of contract and being released from the contract under mutual agreement. This is \none question on one e-QIP that occurred more than four-and-a-half years ago. SOR \u00b6 \n17.c applies to due to the passage of time and the behavior being infrequent. He did not \nfully describe he was terminated for plugging a hard drive into his government computer. \nHowever, he explained the termination for plugging in the hard drive on his January 2012 \ne-QIP and on his January 2012 Declaration for Federal Employment, and told his \nprospective employer at the JTFB about it, all of which occurred before he completed the \nMay 2015 e-QIP.  \n \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s May 2015 e-QIP, he explained his 2011 termination in a \nSeptember 2017 sworn statement. On his July 2017 e-QIP he fully explained in detail that \nhe had connected a non-government external hard drive to test it on his government \ncomputer resulting in the termination of his employment. It was not established that \nApplicant deliberately falsified his July 2017 e-QIP by failing to disclose the details of his \n2017 termination.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines M, use \nof information technology, and E, personal conduct, are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nThe general sense of the statements of a coworker, his employer, and two former \nsupervisors is that Applicant is careful about safeguarding classified information, diligent, \nprofessional, responsible, trustworthy, reliable, and honest. Their statements support \n\n \n18 \nreinstatement of his security clearance. The government investigator stated Applicant\u2019s \nworkstation was in an elevated category, but he could not say who had put Applicant in \nthat elevated category. Applicant vehemently denies he modified his system configuration \nto violate security requirements. He asserts he did not have the knowledge, administrative \nrights, or the technical skills necessary to modify system configurations to disable the \nHBSS. The HBSS was controlled by the AI administrator who was the only person who \ncould disable the HBSS.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor does not believe Applicant had the ability to make the \nchanges. The changes to circumvent security protocols or do something on a high-end \nserver would not have given any value added for Applicant. There was no Cyber Incident \nreport filed, which would have included log files, dates of proven incidents, login records, \nand additional information showing illegal software or an illegitimate reason for disabling \nsoftware in order to install required software, and then re-enable the software. Applicant \nasserts he did not make the changes, and there is no evidence he did so.  \n \nApplicant viewed hate websites when an individual he knew made national news \nfor running a hate site. He viewed these sites out of personal curiosity to learn of the \naccusations. He had photographs of women on his computer. The government \ninvestigator only viewed a few of the photographs and admitted the photographs could \nhave come from Facebook as asserted by Applicant. Neither of these events violated the \nAcceptable Use Policy.  \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a with respect to the alleged violations of \nadministrative and access privileges, and 2.c are unsubstantiated. He mitigated the \nsecurity concerns listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 2.a with respect to the insertion of the hard drive, \nand 2.b. The record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about his eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the use of information technology and personal conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n19 \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________________ \nClaude Heiny \nAdministrative Judge \n \n,  \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nOn April 16, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 27, 2018. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 13, 2018. A notice of hearing was issued \non December 19, 2018, scheduling the hearing on January 15, 2019. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. During the hearing, the Government offered five exhibits which were \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. Applicant testified and offered 17  \nexhibits which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 Q, without objection. The \nrecord was held open until January 29, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. He timely submitted three documents which were admitted as AE R \u2013 T, \nwithout objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 25, 2019. Based upon a \n\n \n2 \n \n \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a DoD contractor seeking to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. He has worked for his current employer since 2015. Applicant also \nhas his own company, but he stopped running the business in 2016. Prior to his current \njob, he worked for private industry, government contractors, and as a federal \ngovernment civilian employee. He has held a security clearance on and off since 1986. \nThe highest level of education Applicant has achieved is a doctorate degree. He is a \ngraduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. He served on active duty for over four years. He \nwas medically discharged and received an honorable discharge.  He is married and has \nthree adult children. (Tr.67-74, 123; Gov 1)    \n \nOn July 17, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. (Gov 1) A \nsubsequent security clearance background investigation resulted in the following SOR \nallegations: Applicant failed to file his Federal and State income returns for tax years \n2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015.  (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 1 at 60-65); a delinquent \nmortgage account was past due in the amount of $38,371 with a total approximate \nbalance of $391,536. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 1 at 67-69; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 5); a \nhomeowners association filed a warrant in debt against Applicant on January 2018 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c: Gov 4 at 1-2); a $13,907 delinquent account with a bank was placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 2); and a $7,263 credit-card account was \ncharged off. (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 2). \n \nAdditional allegations include:  a charged-off account with a bank in the amount \nof $4,668 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Gov 2 at 2; Gov 4 at 3-4); an account with a timeshare owner\u2019s \nassociation in the amount of $1,268 that was placed for collection. (SOR \u00b6 1.g:  Gov 2 \nat 10); and a $134 delinquent medical account that was placed for collection.(SOR \u00b6 \n1.h: Gov 2 at 10). \n \nFailure to File State and Federal Income Tax Returns \n \nApplicant admits he failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. He failed to file his income tax returns \ninitially because he moved in 2009 to a new area and immediately was assigned \noverseas for five months. When he returned in May 2010, he was late filing his tax \nreturns, and he could not find his documentation because it was located in storage. \nApplicant admits he procrastinated filing his state and federal tax returns over the next \nfive years. He believed that he was to receive refunds and did not think it was important \nto file his state and federal tax returns. At the urging of his friends, Applicant hired a \nCPA in 2016. His state and federal tax returns for tax years 2010 \u2013 2015 were filed in \nJune 2016. Applicant received refunds on his tax returns. There is no indication in the \nrecord whether the Internal Revenue Service assessed a penalty regarding the late \nfiling of the returns. (Tr. 79-84; Answer to SOR; AE H \u2013 M) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn the middle of 2017, Applicant was contacted by the state department of \ntaxation regarding his failure to file back taxes. The state apparently lost the tax returns \nso Applicant re-submitted his state tax returns for tax years 2010 \u2013 2015 in April 23, \n2018. In a letter dated August 31, 2018, the state department of taxation indicated \nApplicant owed $464.59. On January 10, 2019, the state department of taxation issued \nApplicant a refund on $111.40 for tax year 2015. (Tr. 86-89, 91-92; AE P; AE Q)   \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he had not filed his state and federal \ntax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. Applicant testified that his failure to file his \nstate and federal tax returns for 2016 and 2017 was his responsibility. He was still \ngathering documentation to give to his accountant to file the returns. (Tr. 89-90, 93)  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend to the SOR to be in \nconformity with the evidence in accordance with Directive, paragraph E3.1.17. The \nmotion was granted, but the record was held open for an additional two weeks to allow   \nApplicant additional time to provide additional documents regarding the status of his \n2016 and 2017 federal and state tax returns. (Tr. 132-136) After the hearing, Applicant \ntimely provided an Internal Revenue Service (IRS Form 4868), Application for Automatic \nExtension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for tax year 2017. The \nextension gave Applicant six more months to file his 2017 income tax return, which \nwould have been due October 15, 2018. At the close of the record, there was no proof \nthat Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for 2016 and 2017. (AE R; \nAE S)  \n \nOther Financial Issues \n \nIn 2005, Applicant and his wife built a house which ended up costing more than \nthey had anticipated. In order to pay for some special upgrades during the home \nconstruction, Applicant charged a lot on his credit cards. As the sole breadwinner of the \nfamily, Applicant had difficulty making the mortgage payments. In May 2008, Applicant \nresigned his position as a U.S. contractor and accepted a position as a GS-15 with the \nfederal government. His new job was located in another city several hours from where \nhe resided. He commuted to his new job location during the week and would return \nhome on the weekends. (Tr. 94-99; Answer to SOR)  \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant put the house on the market in the midst of the housing \ncrisis. The mortgage on the house was more than the value of the house. He rented the \nhouse for a few years, but often the rent did not cover the mortgage. He had difficulty \nmaking payments and got behind on his other finances. (Tr. 94-100; Answer to SOR) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant changed jobs and began working as a government contractor, \nhoping that it would increase his income. He continued to fall behind on his expenses. \nHe refused to give up on his debts. Towards the end of 2017, the contract that he was \nworking on was not renewed. He lost billable hours resulting in his financial situation \nbecoming more unstable. He was only able to find a contract job which paid one third of \nhis previous income. (Answer to SOR) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant stopped making mortgage payments. He attempted to \nobtain a short sale the property or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. His efforts were \nunsuccessful. The home was foreclosed in October 2017. (Tr. 95-103; Answer to SOR) \n \nAfter many years of trying to keep his mortgage and maintain his finances, \nApplicant contacted a debt-relief agency to help him negotiate his delinquent accounts. \nApplicant signed an agreement with the debt-relief agency on March 20, 2018. He pays \nthe debt-relief agency $1,500 a month, which the debt-relief agency uses to enter into \nsettlement agreements and pay off debts. His anticipated debt-free target is March \n2022. (Tr. 105-106; Answer to SOR; AE C \u2013 AE G).  \n \nThe accounts in the plan with the debt-relief agency include the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. In addition, there were several debts that are not alleged in \nthe SOR. The debts include a $47,800 debt owed to a bank, which is the second \nmortgage on the home that went to foreclosure; a $20,800 debt owed to a bank; a \n$20,543 debt owed to a credit union, and a $5,278 debt owed to a financial services \ncompany. (Tr. 103-106; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G: AE N)  In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at \n4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct \nnot alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). I have considered the non-SOR derogatory information \naccordingly. \n \nThe status of the SOR debts is: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: - Failure to file state and federal income tax returns for 2010, 2011, \n2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 - During the hearing, SOR \u00b6 1.a was amended to add tax \nyears 2016 and 2017. The state and federal tax returns for 2010 to 2015 were filed in \nJune 2016. He resubmitted the state tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2015 in 2018. It \nappears he received refunds for each year. No documentation was provided from the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) discussing the status of his tax situation, such as if \npenalties were imposed as a result of the late filing of his tax returns. At the close of the \nrecord, the state and federal tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 remain unfiled.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: - Mortgage past due in the amount of $38,371, with a total balance of \n$391,536 - The home was foreclosed in 2017. Applicant stopped making mortgage \npayments in January 2017. He is not aware whether he owes a deficiency after the \nmortgage foreclosure. In his answer to the SOR, he provided a copy of an IRS form \n\n \n5 \n \n \n1099-A, Acquisition of Abandonment of Secured Property.  It states the foreclosure \noccurred on November 14, 2017.  The fair market value of the property was $421,104.  \nThe balance on the principle mortgage was $391,535. It appears there was no \ndeficiency regarding the primary mortgage.  (Tr. 94-103; Answer to SOR, attach 1.b)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: - Warrant in debt filed against Applicant by a homeowner\u2019s \nassociation - On February 27, 2018, an attorney collecting on behalf of the \nhomeowner\u2019s association, wrote Applicant indicating that they received a payment \ntowards the account in the amount of $1,923.81. There was a balance of $70.43. \nApplicant paid off the remaining $70.43 balance in April 2018. The debt is resolved. (Tr. \n106-108; Answer to SOR, attach 1.c; AE A)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: - $13,907 debt placed for collection - Applicant believes this is either \na credit-card debt or a debt owed to a timeshare. In April 2018, the debt-relief agency \nnegotiated a settlement for Applicant in the amount of $6,258.27. Payments towards the \nsettlement were to begin soon thereafter. (Tr. 108-111; AE N) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: - $7,263 charged-off credit account with a store - On April 3, 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s debt-relief agency negotiated a settlement of $2,905. Payments to be made \nin monthly installments of $255. Applicant provided proof that monthly payments were \nmade from April 2018 to December 2018. (Tr. 112; AE N; AE O) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: - $4,668 charged-off account: Agency negotiated this debt - He \nagreed to pay $2,000 by December 2017. The remaining balance of $2,668 was \ndischarged by the creditor in tax year 2017. In his response to the SOR, Applicant \nprovided a copy of the 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, from the creditor. The $2,668 \namount was discharged. The account is resolved. However, Applicant may have some \ntax implications as a result of the cancellation of debt. (Tr. 114; Answer to SOR, \nattachment 1.f) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: - $1,268 collection account for fees owed to a timeshare - This \naccount is being negotiated by his debt-relief agency. On April 9, 2018, an agreement \nwas reached to settle this account. The balance was $5,479. Applicant agreed to pay \n$2,188.51 and to sign a deed in lieu of foreclosure. He agreed to pay $211 a month \nfrom May 2018 to February 2019 to settle the account. He provided proof payments \nwere made from May 2018 to December 2018. (Tr. 115-116; Answer to SOR; AE B; AE \nN; AE O)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: - $134 medical collection account - Applicant disputes this debt \nbecause he does not recognize the account. (Tr. 116)   \n \nApplicant owned three timeshares. The first timeshare was purchased in 1994. \nHe owned this timeshare, but was still responsible for fees. He purchased a second \ntimeshare a few years later. He purchased a third timeshare in 2009, after his family \nmoved to his new work location. He wanted a place for his wife and children to go to the \npool during the summer. Applicant could not pay his annual fees for all three \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntimeshares. He is negotiating settlements with them in his debt-relief plan. (Tr. 117- \n120) \n \nApplicant has not sought the advice of a financial planner or credit counselor. He \nhas not used a credit card in over a year. He testified that he has no open credit-card \naccounts. He has not incurred new debt within 16 months prior to the hearing. He does \nnot know the amount of his current monthly income. In addition to his salary, he \nreceives a $1,300 monthly payment from the Veteran\u2019s Administration for his medical \nretirement and disability. He does not know what his monthly expenses are. He claims \nhe is able to pay his debts and has a little income left over each month. He does not \nhave a 401(k). (Tr. 121-129)  \n \nWhole-Person Evidence \n \n \nDr. J., Applicant\u2019s friend and business partner, testified during the hearing. He \nhas known Applicant since 2004. Their business contracts with private and government \norganizations for training. They both studied for their doctoral programs at the same \ntime. Around 2015, Dr. J. invited Applicant to come work for him as a contractor. They \nhave been business partners since 2015. There was a period around 2016 where some \nof their contracts ended and there was no money coming into the business. (Tr. 28-37) \n \nDr. J. is aware of Applicant\u2019s tax and financial issues. In October 2018 or 2019, \nhe was contacted by the IRS and told to change Applicant\u2019s tax withholdings to zero \nexemptions. He testified that Applicant is not good at paper work, which is the cause of \nApplicant\u2019s problems. Aside from these issues, Applicant\u2019s character is beyond \nreproach. His reliability and ethics are good. Dr. J. has no concerns with Applicant  \nhaving a security clearance. (Tr. 40-43) \n \n \nDr. J. is in charge of the S corporation. The corporation has four full-time \nemployees and two part-time employees. They all work on different contracts. He \nestimates Applicant\u2019s annual income was approximately $175,000 annually in a good \nyear when Applicant worked a full schedule. Applicant\u2019s income was less in years where \nthey did not have as many contracts. There was not much business in 2016 and 2017, \nso Applicant earned less income. In 2017, Applicant changed to being a salaried \nemployee. His annual income is around $143,000. (Tr. 46-49, 56) \n \n \nApplicant told Dr. J. about his financial issues in 2015. Dr. J. does all of the \nbookkeeping, so he is not concerned about Applicant\u2019s financial situation. He wants \nApplicant to resolve his tax situation before he is listed as a company officer. (Tr. 50-\n51.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems since around 2008. The SOR \nalleged a delinquent mortgage account; and over $27,000 in delinquent consumer \ndebts. He failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2010 to \n2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n  \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or careless in his obligations to protect classified information. Behaving \nirresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in \nother aspects of life. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until \nevidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to pay debts under \nagreed terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s federal tax debts, the emphasis of the DOHA Appeal \nBoard on security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. \n14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \n\u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action \nonly after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of \nrules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and emphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); See also \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, and stating, \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal \nGovernment for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other \nobligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \n\u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems have occurred \nover a long period of time and are ongoing. While he has obtained the services of a \ndebt-relief agency, it is noted that he did not retain the services of the debt-relief agency \n\n \n10 \n \n \nuntil after the SOR was issued. It is too soon to conclude that he will complete all of his \ndebt-settlement agreements. Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns over an eight-year-period remains an issue. The record is lacking evidence \nregarding whether he owes any penalties to the IRS for his late filing of his 2010-2015 \nfederal tax returns. At the close of the record, he had not filed his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. Concerns remain about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies because Applicant\u2019s financial situation was adversely \naffected by the mortgage crisis of 2008 and the loss of a contract resulted in an income \nreduction. These circumstances were beyond his control and adversely affected his \nability to pay his bills. However, this mitigating condition is given less weight because he \nhas not demonstrated he acted responsibly under the circumstances. His \nprocrastination in resolving his tax, mortgage, and financial issues over a number of \nyears indicate that he was ignoring the problem. For this reason AG \u00b6 20(b) is given \nless weight.      \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not take a formal financial-counseling \ncourse. His financial situation is not under control.   \n \n \nAG & 20(d) partially applies because Applicant entered into an agreement with a \ndebt-relief agency in March 2018 to help with settling his debts. He has shown proof \nthat the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f are paid, and that he has entered into settlement \nagreements to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. It is too soon to \nconclude that he will complete the payment plans based on his history of financial \nirresponsibility. A promise to pay in the future is not sufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns raised under the financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s plan with the debt-relief \nagency included four debts that were not alleged in the SOR, to include a $47,800 \nsecond mortgage from the house that was foreclosed and approximately $46,000 in \nconsumer debt. His heavy debt as well his failure to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns over an eight-year-period give this mitigating condition less weight.  \n \nAG & 20(g) applies, in part, because Applicant filed his federal and state tax \nreturns for tax year 2010-2015 in June 2016. However, it is troubling that he has yet to \nfile his federal and state income tax returns for 2016 and 2017. He did not provide a \ngood justification for not filing his 2016 and 2017 federal and state tax returns. While his \ndocuments indicate he was owed a refund, he did not provide documentation from the \nIRS, such as copies of his tax transcripts indicating the status of his taxes and whether \nhe owes late filing penalties.  \n \nI find SOR \u00b6 1.h for Applicant. He did not recognize this medical debt. There was \ninsufficient information for him to research whether the debt belonged to him. The \nminimal amount of the debt does not raise a concern.  \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n        I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nemployment history as a federal contractor and employee. I considered how the 2008 \nmortgage crisis affected his ability to sell his house. I considered the impact the \nnonrenewal of a contract affected his income. I also considered his history of financial \nproblems beginning in 2009. Most concerning is his failure to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns over an eight-year-period. Procrastination is not a sufficient excuse \nfor his failure to file his federal and state tax returns. While he took steps to file his \nfederal and state tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2015 in June 2016, he failed to timely \nfile his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. At the close of the \nrecord, the returns had not been filed. If individuals are to be entrusted with our nation\u2019s \nsecrets, they have a duty to timely file their federal and state income tax returns. \nSecurity concerns under financial considerations are not mitigated.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d. 1.e, 1.g \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.f.,1.h \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP J. KATAUSKAS \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and \nmitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial history. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that his \ncircumstances raised security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on June \n8, 2017, apply here. Applicant answered the SOR on May 22, 2018, and requested a \nhearing to establish his eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n2 \n \nI was assigned the case on September 13, 2018. On January 17, 2019, a date \nmutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. Applicant testified at the hearing. \nThe Government offered four exhibits, which were marked for identification as GE 1 \nthrough 4, and which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered no exhibits. The \nrecord was left open until February 7, 2019. Applicant did not submit any documents post-\nhearing. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 28, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 41 years old, a high school graduate with some college credits. He is \nmarried with three children, two daughters ages eight and three, and a son age five. Since \nFebruary 2006, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors. (Tr. 21, 31-33; GE \n1.)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 10 delinquent accounts totaling $20,901.  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.) Applicant admitted all of those accounts. (Answer \u00b6 1.) Applicant testified \nabout the status of the SOR delinquent debts. SOR \u00b6 1.a is Applicant\u2019s home mortgage. \nApplicant testified that he brought the mortgage current 6 to 12 months ago. That debt, \nhowever, was reported delinquent as of March 15, 2018. (Tr. 57-59; GE 4.) The other \nnine delinquent debts are charge-offs (4), collections (4), and one judgment. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-\nf & h; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, g-h & j; SOR \u00b6 1.i.) The virtually uniform descriptions of the current \nstatus of the delinquent SOR debts are: (1) they went delinquent between 2012 and 2014; \n(2) Applicant plans to pay those debts by payment plan or otherwise; (3) there are no \npayment plans in effect; and (4) Applicant has made no payments on those debts. (Tr. \n57-80.) \n \nApplicant testified about the circumstances that caused his financial problems. Not      \nlong after Applicant\u2019s oldest daughter was born, she showed signs of developmental \ndelay. Applicant took her to a number of specialists and neurologists. At age 4, she was \ndiagnosed to be fully on the far end of the autism spectrum. She is non-verbal with erratic \nbehavior. She is currently enrolled in a special needs program. (Tr. 21-22.) \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s daughter was evaluated for a school-based special needs \nprogram, Applicant was told that she would not qualify for a high school diploma and \nwould need to go through a certificate program instead. Because Applicant believed his \ndaughter was smart and capable, Applicant objected to that finding and hired a lawyer to \nchallenge it. That was not an expense Applicant had anticipated before her birth (about \n$2,500 to $3,000). The challenge was successful, and Applicant\u2019s daughter was \nrecommended for a very expensive form of in-home therapy, involving four to five days \nper week of therapist visits. The insurance that Applicant has through his employer does \nnot cover that therapy. As a result, Applicant had to go to the outside insurance market \nfor insurance that would cover that therapy. He was successful, but the insurance he \nobtained has very high deductibles. He estimated that her specialized coverage costs \nmore than $500 per month. Applicant\u2019s daughter needs constant attention and now has \na full-time therapist. (Tr. 23-24, 27-28, 50-52, 87.) \n \n\n3 \n \nAs a result of the costs of his daughter\u2019s in-home therapy, Applicant had to \nprioritize his mortgage, taxes, and utilities to keep a roof over his family\u2019s head and to \nmake sure his other two children were being taken care of. His credit card bills, however, \nwere not being paid on time. To keep himself gainfully employed, Applicant took out-of-\nstate and out-of-country work assignments. (Tr. 23-25.) \n \nApplicant also suffered loss of household income when his spouse took time off \nafter the birth of her three children. The oldest daughter was born in April 2011, and her \nmother took about 12 to 18 months off after her birth. At the time, Applicant\u2019s spouse was \nmaking about $80,000 per year. Although she applied for unemployment compensation, \nthe household income suffered a significant loss until Applicant\u2019s spouse went back to \nwork at the $80,000 per year range. Applicant\u2019s son was born in May 2014. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse took about three to six months off, and at the time, she had been making about \n$100,000 per year. Applicant\u2019s younger daughter was born in September 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s wife took three to six months off, and at the time she was making just over \n$100,000 per year. When Applicant\u2019s wife rejoined the workforce, she made about \n$70,000 per year, which is her current salary. She took a pay cut in order to work from \nhome to get the children to school, be home when they return, and be home when her \noldest daughter\u2019s therapist is there. In sum, Applicant\u2019s household income decreased by \nabout $80,000 when his oldest daughter was born, about $50,000 when his son was born, \nand about $50,000 when his youngest daughter was born. (Tr. 41-49.) \n \nApplicant testified about his household finances. Currently, he and his spouse earn \n$80,000 and $70,000 per year, respectively. They have no other sources of income. They \nhave no car loans and no savings account. Applicant\u2019s 401(k) has about a $15,000 \nbalance. The only real estate they own is the family home. In 2009, when it was \npurchased, the sale price was $390,000. Applicant is current on his state and federal \nincome taxes. He has never owed any taxes and always gets a refund. He has never filed \nfor bankruptcy. Applicant has not taken any financial counseling courses. (Tr. 37-40, 53, \n55, 81-82, 91-92.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage payment is $2,500 per month. Groceries are about $800 per \nmonth. Utilities are $250 per month. Cable and cellphones are $300 per month. Car \ninsurance and gas are $650 per month. Specialized insurance coverage is more than \n$500 per month. Employer-sponsored health insurance is $400 per month. That yields a \nnet remainder of $7,125 per month. Applicant sets aside some of that remainder to pay \nsome of the smaller debts. His plan is to get current on the mortgage and day-to-day \nexpenses to improve his credit score, so he can take out a home equity loan to pay off all \noutstanding bills.   (Tr. 27, 82-99.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n\n4 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n5 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n     (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. The next question is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply.   \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \n     creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n Although the SOR debts might have been incurred several years ago, they  remain \ndelinquent today. Nor are the delinquent debts infrequent; there are ten such debts. Thus, \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nThere were a number of factors that contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. \nFirst, his oldest daughter was born with profound developmental infirmities. To give his \ndaughter the best chance for some developmental success, Applicant retained an \nattorney to challenge the special educational plan initially proposed. His attorney was \nsuccessful, but legal fees were unexpected before his daughter\u2019s birth. Second, \nApplicant\u2019s employer-sponsored health insurance did not cover his daughter\u2019s \nrecommended therapy. As a result, Applicant purchased specialized insurance coverage \nfor his daughter. This was a significant unanticipated cost. Third, the birth of Applicant\u2019s \n\n6 \n \nchildren necessitated that his spouse take time off from her employment, thus causing \nthe loss of significant amounts of household income. I conclude that those factors were \nlargely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied.  \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe adverse circumstances he was facing. Applicant\u2019s strategy is to pay enough of his \ndelinquent debts to improve his credit score, so he can take out a home equity loan to  \nretire all of his delinquencies. That is a reasonable plan, and I do not doubt that Applicant \nintends to follow that plan. Applicant has not, however, taken any steps to implement that \nplan. He has not made any payments on any of the SOR debts. Nor has he set up any \npayment plans for any of those debts. Applicant has not submitted any documents \nshowing the existence of such a plan, nor any documents showing a track record of \nadhering to any plan. A promise or a stated intent to pay debts is not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt payment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, \n2015). AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. For the same reasoning, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \nThe record raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9).) \n \n    Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

She presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nand mitigate the security concern stemming from her problematic financial history. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that her \ncircumstances raised security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on June \n8, 2017, apply here. Applicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2018, and requested a \nhearing to establish her eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n2 \n \nI was assigned the case on September 13, 2018. On December 19, 2018, a date \nmutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. Applicant testified at the hearing. \nThe Government offered six exhibits, which were marked for identification as GE 1 \nthrough 6, and which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered two exhibits (AE), \nwhich were marked for identification as AE A and B, and were admitted without objection. \nThe record was left open until January 9, 2019. Applicant timely submitted four additional \nexhibits, which were marked for identification as AE C through AE F and admitted without \nobjection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, a high school graduate with an associate degree, and is \ntaking online courses to finish her bachelor\u2019s degree by June 2020. Applicant has six \nchildren between 16 and 3 years of age. She is unmarried, but for 18 years she lived with \nher partner, who is the father of her six children. He died in August 2018. Since August \n2016, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor. This is the first time she has \napplied for a security clearance. (Tr. 18-19, 21-23, 34, 71.) \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 18 delinquent accounts totaling $26,978, of \nwhich $4,939 are for medical accounts. (SOR \u00b6 1; Tr. 61-62.) Applicant denied 13 of those \naccounts. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-e and k-r.) She admitted five of those accounts. (Answer \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-\nj.) The denied debts are supported by the record. (GE 3; GE 4.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a judgment for $1,046. Applicant testified that this judgment has been \nsettled, and post-hearing, she produced a document supporting that claim. (Tr. 36-38; AE \nC.) This debt has been resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a medical debt for $1,047. Applicant testified that she contacted the \ncredit bureau, and they could not tell her the origin of this debt. She went online and \ndisputed this debt, but it has not been removed from her credit report. (Tr. 39-41; GE 3, \np. 2.)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a medical debt for $623. Applicant was unable to find out the origin \nof this debt. (Tr. 41; GE 3, p. 2.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and e are collection debts for $76 and $73, respectively. Applicant \ntestified that she settled those debts and produced documents post-hearing supporting \nthat claim. (Tr. 42-43; AE D; AE E.) Those debts have been resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a judgment for $649. Applicant testified that her landlord at the time \nwas supposed to include the cost of oil heat in her monthly rent. He failed to do so and \nhad opened the account in Applicant\u2019s name.  He proceeded to file a judgment against \nher. (Tr. 43-45; GE 6.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and h are student loans for $3,734 and $2,843, respectively. Applicant \ntestified that those loans are no longer in default. At the hearing and post-hearing, she \n\n3 \n \nproduced documents supporting that claim. (Tr. 45-47; AE B; AE F.) Those debts have \nbeen resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is credit card delinquency for $425. Applicant testified that she brought \nany past-due balance current in December 2017. She is supported by an exhibit she \nproduced at the hearing. (Tr. 48-50; AE B.) This debt has been resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j is a $2,430 debt owed to a cell phone provider. Applicant testified that \nthis was an account set up for her now deceased partner. She called the provider in April  \n2018 and was told that no amount was due. She also has a cell phone with the same \nprovider, and she is current on that account. (Tr. 50-52.) This debt has been resolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k is a medical debt for $1,210. Applicant testified that she was not able \nto find the origin of that debt and could not verify the amount alleged. (Tr. 52-53.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l is a medical debt for $860. Applicant testified that she contacted the \ncreditor in June 2018 to remove the debt in connection with her home purchase. She has \nnot filed any written dispute. (Tr. 53-54.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m is a medical debt for $815. Applicant testified that she called the phone \nnumber that was on the credit report and all she got was her account number. Applicant \ntook no further steps and did not file a dispute. (Tr. 54-55.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n is a debt owed to a cell phone provider for $640. Applicant testified that \nshe recognized this debt. She contacted the provider in about July 2016 and learned that \nit was an early termination fee. Applicant disputed the debt because she moved out of the \nprovider\u2019s service area and was told that she did not have to pay an early termination fee. \nShe did not file a written dispute. (Tr. 55-57.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a medical debt for $593. Applicant did not recognize this debt. (Tr. \n56-57.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p is a medical debt for $523. Applicant did not recognize this debt. She \nexplained that for all the SOR debts she denied, she was trying to clean up her credit \nreport in connection with buying her house in August 2018. Applicant went on Credit \nKarma and clicked the \u201cDispute\u201d selection for the denied debts. She never heard anything \nback from Credit Karma. Applicant has no written documentation that confirms those \ndebts are disputed. (Tr. 20, 57-58.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.q is a $428 debt for a car rental. Applicant allowed a friend to rent a car \nusing her credit card. Applicant recalled that there was some damage to the car that her \nfriend failed to pay. The rental was paid but not for the damage. Applicant testified that it \nhappened when she was very young, over 10 years ago. The debt was written off, but \nshe does not know when. Applicant is currently able to rent from the same car rental \ncompany. (Tr. 58-61.) \n \n\n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r is a medical debt for $129. Applicant has two accounts with this medical \ninsurer. She is not sure which account this debt is for. Applicant disputed this debt on \nCredit Karma in about April or June 2018. (Tr. 61-62.) (This was not alleged as a medical \ndebt in the SOR.  Based on Applicant\u2019s testimony, it is such a debt.) \n \nApplicant testified about her personal finances. She has not taken any financial \ncounseling. Applicant\u2019s full-time employment with the defense contractor pays $50,000 \nper year. She also has a business on the side doing children\u2019s parties and other child \nentertainment events. That averages about $1,500 per month. Those incomes yield \n$5,667 take-home pay per month. (Tr. 24-25, 62-63.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage is $2,800 per month. She receives $528 per month in child \nassistance. Her brother pays for her children\u2019s clothes. Applicant\u2019s gas, utilities, auto \ninsurance, and miscellaneous expenses come to about $785 per month. She has no car \npayments. Applicant owns two cars, but both are paid off. Her monthly remainder is about \n$1,100 per month. Of that remainder, Applicant puts $500 per month in the bank so she \n\u201cdoes not see it.\u201d The remaining $1,000 Applicant uses to pay bills. She has about $1,500 \nin savings and about $3,500 in her retirement account. (Tr.27, 29-30, 62-69.) \n \n Applicant\u2019s deceased partner made $75,000 per year as an electrical contractor. \nWhen he died, she lost 60% of the household income. If she needs financial help, her \nfather, brother, an aunt, and an uncle can be counted on to assist her. Applicant has had \ngaps in her employment history due to a workplace injury that put her on workers\u2019 \ncompensation. She still suffers from residual effects of that injury. Applicant also had gaps \nin employment due to pregnancies. (Tr. 19, 29-30; GE 1, pp. 12-19; GE 2, pp. 3-5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n\n5 \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n\n6 \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent consumer debts. The next \nquestion is whether any mitigating conditions apply.   \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe findings of fact demonstrate that Applicant has satisfactorily resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, d, e, g through j under AG \u00b6 20(d) totaling $10,627. SOR \u00b6 1.q ($428) is mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a) due to the passage of time (over 10 years). Similarly, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \nn are mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a) due to unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s medical debts totaling $4,939 present a different issue. I have given \nlittle weight to the eight medical collection accounts that remain unresolved. Medical \ndebt is unlike other types of debt. First, it is presumed that medical debt is incurred  for \nnecessary medical care and treatment as opposed to frivolous or irresponsible spending \nor otherwise living beyond one\u2019s means. Second, medical debt is usually unplanned, \nunexpected, and nondiscretionary. Third, it can add hundreds if not thousands of dollars \nin debt in a short period, which can be overwhelming for a debtor. Finally, the record \nshows that Applicant made good-faith (albeit unsuccessful) efforts to identify the original \ncreditors and verify the bona fides of those accounts. In my view, having less than \n$5,000 in unresolved medical collection accounts does not fatally undermine Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability. Accordingly, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and c, k through p, and r are \ndecided for Applicant. \n \n \nThe record does not raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9).) \n \n    Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old senior cybersecurity engineer and security control assessor/validator currently employed by a defense contractor since December 2017. He has also been employed as a consultant part-time by another defense contractor since 2016. He received his high school general equivalency degree (GED) in 2002. Applicant enlisted in the Army in 2003 and served honorably on active duty until 2007. During his enlistment, he deployed to Iraq where he sustained significant injuries during combat in 3 2004. He has since been awarded a VA Disability Rating of 70%. Applicant served honorably in the Army National Guard from 2009 until 2012. He married in 2006 and divorced in 2009, and has an 11-year-old daughter from this marriage. Applicant was granted his first security clearance in 2008. (GX 1.)

Olmos, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Mark A. Myers \n \n03/31/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns raised by his \npast conduct and ongoing inconsistent statements. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on November 1, 2016. \nOn September 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology). The DOD acted under Executive Order \n(Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n  \n \nApplicant submitted his Answer to the SOR on November 14, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nDecember 30, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on June 7, 2019. On that same \n\n2 \n \nday, DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for June 27, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 9 were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified and Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through AX W \nwere admitted into evidence. I left the record open until July 11, 2019, to enable Applicant \nto submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX X \u2013 AX AA, which I \nhave admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 11, 2019. \n  \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered into evidence GX 4 which is a report of investigation \nfrom Applicant\u2019s 2014 employer which formed the basis for Applicant\u2019s termination. The \nfacts set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a were taken from the report.  Applicant\u2019s attorney objected to \nmy admitting the document because the document did not include the listed attachments \nand was therefore incomplete.  \n \n \nIn ruling on this objection, I considered the following: The report sets forth the \nallegations against Applicant; the company\u2019s applicable policies; a synopsis of events; \nand the names of the involved individuals. In a section entitled \u201cDetails,\u201d the report sets \nforth a description of the events giving rise to the investigation; includes copies of two \nemails between Applicant and a contractor listed as an involved individual; delineates \ninformation from the audit logbook during the time of the incidents; and sets forth \ninformation from the system and application logs. The report also summarizes \ncommunications to and from the information security manager concerning the \ninvestigative process. The report sets forth its conclusions and states the basis for \nApplicant\u2019s termination. Finally, it is signed by the FSO. The listed attachments not \nprovided with the document were \u201caudit log printout,\u201d \u201cemail from [contractor],\u201d and \u201cemail \nfrom [information security manager].\u201d \n \n  \nI considered that the report was incomplete without the listed attachments, but \ndetermined that the report contained sufficient information to be admitted into evidence \nas a business record that was authentic, relevant, and material to determining Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness and gave the document its appropriate weight.    \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Applicant\u2019s attorney again objected to the report as incomplete \nand as inaccurate. Applicant testified at length regarding the report and I have considered \nboth the document and Applicant\u2019s testimony in determining the appropriate weight to \ngive the report. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old senior cybersecurity engineer and security control \nassessor/validator currently employed by a defense contractor since December 2017. He \nhas also been employed as a consultant part-time by another defense contractor since \n2016. He received his high school general equivalency degree (GED) in 2002. Applicant \nenlisted in the Army in 2003 and served honorably on active duty until 2007. During his \nenlistment, he deployed to Iraq where he sustained significant injuries during combat in \n\n3 \n \n2004. He has since been awarded a VA Disability Rating of 70%. Applicant served \nhonorably in the Army National Guard from 2009 until 2012. He married in 2006 and \ndivorced in 2009, and has an 11-year-old daughter from this marriage. Applicant was \ngranted his first security clearance in 2008. (GX 1.)  \n \n \nThe SOR consists of allegations under Guidelines E and M. Under Guideline E, \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant was terminated from two employers, in part, for failure \nto perform audits as required by the National Industry Security Program Operating Manual \n(NISPOM). This conduct is cross-alleged under Guideline M, \u00b6 1.a. The SOR allegations \nand Applicant\u2019s responses to them, are discussed more fully below.  \n \nSOR Allegations \n \nApplicant was terminated from Company A in 2016 for failing to complete \nhis job responsibilities \n \n \nApplicant worked or Company A from January 2016 until August 2016 as a \nsystems security manager. SOR \u00b6 1.a stems from this employment. The SOR \nalleges: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Alleges: \n \n \nYou were terminated from your employment at [Company A] in about \nAugust 2016 for labor mischarging, which is a violation of [Company A\u2019s] code of \nethics and business conduct, along with failing to complete mandatory NISPOM \nrequired audits. \n \n \nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant admits in his Answer that he was terminated \nfrom his employment in August 2016, but denies the alleged conduct that resulted in his \ntermination. He states that despite his efforts to determine the reason for his termination, \nto include filing an ethics complaint (which was found to be without merit), he did not know \nthe reason he was terminated until he received the Government\u2019s discovery. He further \ncontends that the fact that he successfully claimed unemployment benefits is evidence \nthat he was not terminated for cause. Additionally, he denies overcharging his hours, \nstating \u201cmy pay was always correct, if I had falsified my timecard my paycheck should \nhave been different or changed.\u201d He supports this statement by providing copies of his \nMay to September 2016 bank statements. (AX L.) \n \n \nAn August 8, 2016, JPAS incident report states an internal investigation into \nApplicant\u2019s conduct was underway because software patches were not completed as \nnecessary, audits were not performed weekly, and there was potential adverse \ninformation concerning timecards. (GX 5.) \n  \n \nThe Government presented a January 24, 2017, letter from Applicant\u2019s former \nemployer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) to DSS. (GX 7.) The letter that states that the \ninternal investigation concluded that Applicant \u201cwas consistently over reporting time \n\n4 \n \nworked.\u201d The conclusions of the investigation were \u201cbased on badging data and video \nevidence that was obtained from our Security Operations Center along with network login \ndata and cell phone records obtained from our Incident Response Team.\u201d The \ninvestigation also concluded that Applicant had \u201cfailed to conduct mandatory NISPOM \nrequired audits and software updates on classified systems.\u201d The letter also noted that \n\u201call auditing and software updates have been completed and it was determined that there \nwas no loss or compromise of classified data due to this finding.\u201d (GX 7.) \n \n \nApplicant described his job responsibilities as \u201cthe facility security officer, \n[community security] custodian, the information system security manager, the offsite \nprogram manager, that was it.\u201d (Tr. 90.) \n \n \nBased on the findings of the investigation, Applicant\u2019s employer determined that \nApplicant was in violation of its code of ethics and business conduct and NISPOM \nrequirements and terminated Applicant in August 2016. The letter also stated that all \nauditing and software updates had since been completed and that no classified material \nhad been compromised. (GX 7.)  \n \n \nApplicant refutes the findings of investigation set forth in the January 2017 letter. \nHe testified that he completed all audits as required and that he properly reported his \nhours. (Tr. 30-31.) He also stated that the fact that he was eligible for unemployment \nbenefits is evidence that he was not fired for cause. (Tr. 30.)  \n \n \nApplicant presented a May 3, 2019, letter from a former off-site FSO of the 2016 \nemployer to refute the Government\u2019s evidence. The former FSO worked for the 2016 \nemployer January 2006 until January 2019. Her tenure included Applicant\u2019s period of \nemployment. She did not directly supervise Applicant in his FSO responsibilities, but he \ndid report to her department. She stated that he did not have any security incidents or \nviolations and that he successfully passed two Defense Security Service (DSS) audits. \nDSS routinely conducts security vulnerability assessments to assess compliance with the \nprovisions of NISPOM and evaluate facilities\u2019 programs for protecting classified \ninformation in compliance with current directives. (AX M.) The former FSO further stated \nthat she had known Applicant for five years and strongly recommends continuing his \nsecurity clearance. (AX W.)  \n \n \nThe former FSO states that she reviewed the January 2017 letter and states \u201cwith \na degree of certainty that the evidence collected against [Applicant] could not be possible \nfor the following reasons:  \n \n1) The closed area (classified workspace) where Applicant worked did not have \nbadging capabilities; \n \n2) The closed area contains classified materials, and there are no video recording \ndevices within the facility for this reason; \n \n\n5 \n \n3) The closed area contains a classified network that is not connected to the \nInternet.  It would not have been possible to obtain Applicant\u2019s login data \nrecords because there is no external connection;  \n \n4) The employer did not allow company applications, to include email, on personal \nmobile devices, therefore it would not have been possible to obtain Applicant\u2019s \npersonal cell phone records.  \n \n \nThe former FSO also states that she prepared for a DSS audit immediately \nfollowing Applicant\u2019s termination, although she does not specify the date the audit was \nperformed. She states that when she conducted the audit, it showed that all required \naudits had been properly completed and were in compliance with NISPOM, and that there \nwere no missing software updates.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that the employer installed a badge reader on an external door \nshortly before Applicant\u2019s termination. (Tr. 94.) Additionally, he also stated that he was \nrequired to log in to the company\u2019s internal network to utilize the company\u2019s email. (Tr. \n130.)  \n \nApplicant was terminated from Company B in 2014 for failing to complete \nhis job responsibilities \n \n \nApplicant worked or Company B from April to November 2014 as an information \nsecurity manager. SOR \u00b6 1.b stems from this employment. The SOR alleges: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Alleges: \n \n \nYou were terminated from your employment at [Company B] in about \nNovember 2014 for failure to perform an audit on a computer used to process \nclassified information as required by the NISPOM Section 8-602a. You completed \na tracking log indicating you perform the audit on October 24, 2014, and when \nconfronted about the audit, you continued to claim you had completed the audit. A \nsubsequent investigation determined you did not complete the audit and were \ncapable for falsifying business/government records and not acting in accordance \nwith the [Company B] code of ethics. \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.b and sets forth several bases for his \ndenial. First, Applicant states that he does not believe that he was \u201cfired from his position.\u201d \nHe bases this statement on the facts that he successfully collected unemployment as \nbeing \u201claid off,\u201d the employer did not protest his unemployment claim, and that he was not \nrequired to reimburse the company for his relocation funds as he would have been \nrequired to do if he had been terminated for cause.  \n \n \nIn his Answer and testimony, Applicant further supports this position by referencing \nan email exchange he had with a former coworker wherein Applicant stated that he told \na potential employer that he had been \u201cdownsized.\u201d In this same email, Applicant states \n\n6 \n \nthat his former manager and a human resources (HR) representative would not provide \nhim with any information as to why he was \u201clet go, just that [he] was.\u201d He characterizes a \nstatement made by the former coworker in an email \u201cno one is saying what happened.\u201d \nApplicant submitted an email exchange with HR wherein HR stated that it would not \nprovide Applicant with a copy of the JPAS incident report (GX 5) concerning his \ntermination or any documentation concerning why he was \u201cdismissed,\u201d and that he did \nnot need to complete any forms in order to apply for unemployment. (Tr. 34-35; AX N.) \nApplicant also noted during his testimony that he was offered another position with the \nemployer in another state approximately three weeks after he was terminated. (Tr. 35.) \n \n \nHowever, Applicant testified that in 2014:   \n \nAPPLICANT: I was -- same thing, human resources called me into their \noffice and just said that I was terminated and that was it. I wasn't given any \nreason.   \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: So that was in November of 2014, you were --   \n \nAPPLICANT: Yes.   \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: -- they told you, you were fired?   \n \nAPPLICANT: Yes, ma'am.   \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: But you didn't put that on your security clearance \napplication?   \n \nAPPLICANT: Well not fired, just terminated, and then I --   \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: Well what do you think terminated means?   \n \nAPPLICANT: I attempted to find out after, what the reason was.   \n \nADMIN. JUDGE: What do you think terminated means?   \n \nAPPLICANT: I don't know ma'am. It could mean anything. (Tr. 87-88.) \n \n \nThe second basis of Applicant\u2019s denial of SOR \u00b6 1.b is that his \u201cposition did not \ninclude performing audits on computers. This was the responsibility of [a coworker].\u201d \n(Answer.)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant made the following assertions regarding \nperforming audits:  \n \n1) It was not Applicant\u2019s job to perform NISPOM audits, and he did not have \nthe necessary authorizations to do them. Performing NISPOM audits \nwas the responsibility of his coworker. (Tr. 35-36.) \n \n2) The audits were divided into the technical part and the policies and \nprocedures part. It was Applicant\u2019s coworker\u2019s responsibility to perform \nthe technical part of the audits and Applicant\u2019s responsibility to perform \nthe policy and procedure part of the audits. (Tr. 62-63.) \n \n3) Applicant never performed any of the audits. (Tr. 70.) \n \n \n4) Applicant described audits in general as being about 90% policies and \nprocedure and 10% technical. (Tr. 92.) \n \n5) Applicant and his coworker performed as a team wherein Applicant \nperformed the policy and procedure part of the audits and his coworker \nperformed the technical part because Applicant did not have the \nrequired credentials to do so. (Tr. 128-129.) \n \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is based on a November 11, 2014, JPAS \nincident report (GX 5) and the employer\u2019s report of findings of an investigation dated \nNovember 20, 2014. The report of investigation states: \n \nThe investigation determined that [Applicant] failed to perform an audit on \na computer used to process classified information as required by the \nNISPOM section 8-602a. In addition, [Applicant] recorded an entry in the \naudit log book indicating that he did in fact complete the audit on October \n24, 2014. Finally, [Applicant] was not truthful when confronted about this. \nThis security incident was the result of an intentional disregard for the \nNISPOM requirements and of the [company\u2019s] Code of Ethics. The \ninvestigation deems [Applicant] culpable for an intentional security incident \nand as a result his employment with the company was terminated. (GX 4.) \n \n \nThe report lists the individuals involved in the investigation, one of whom is a \ncontractor. The report sets forth details of conversations between Applicant and the \ncontractor regarding Applicant\u2019s performance of an audit on classified computer #6, \nnicknamed \u201cPoseidon.\u201d The report also includes an email exchange between Applicant \nand the contractor wherein Applicant represents that he performed the audit on October \n24, 2014, but forgot to record an entry in the safe logbook.  \n \n \nThe report also gives details of a meeting and conversation between Applicant and \nhis supervisor. Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who was also the FSO, confronted Applicant about \n\n8 \n \nroutinely submitting inaccurate and incomplete reports and asked if Applicant had \nperformed the required audit. Applicant again confirmed that he had. \n \n \nThe report then delineates the process of the investigation that unequivocally \nconcluded that Applicant did not perform the required audit on the classified computer \nPoseidon on October 24, 2014, as he recorded in the logbook and represented in \nconversations, emails, and during a meeting. \n \n \nFollowing the investigation, the HR manager and the ethics officer interviewed \nApplicant about the results of the investigation and Applicant again stated that he had \ncompleted the audit as required. Applicant was terminated for his conduct. \n \n \nApplicant refutes the report of investigation on the following bases: \n \n1) Applicant never met the contractor and does not know who he is; \n \n2) Applicant confirmed that his email address was accurate, but stated he \nnever exchanged emails with the contractor; \n \n3) Applicant was out of state on vacation at the time of these incidents; \n \n4) Applicant was never confronted by his supervisor about his job \nperformance; \n \n5) Applicant was never interviewed about the results of the investigation. \n(Tr. 37-39; Tr. 74-77.) \n \n \nApplicant also testified that the report was inaccurate because classified computer \n#6 was not nicknamed Poseidon. According to Applicant, Poseidon was the name of a \ncomputer numerically controlled (CNC) machining tool on which audits were not only not \nrequired, but could not be performed. (Tr. 72-73.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a January 27, 2014, letter from DSS to the 2014 employer\u2019s \nFSO. Although prior to Applicant\u2019s employment, the letter states that DSS conducted a \nsecurity vulnerability assessment at the facility and rated it \u201ccommendable.\u201d The \nassessment found six vulnerabilities, which are delineated in the letter. The fourth \nvulnerability, which was corrected on the spot, was: \u201cSecurity relevant objects are not \naudited for failed access.\u201d It lists the systems effected, which includes \u201cPoseidon.\u201d (AX \nT.)  \n \n \nFinally, during his testimony Applicant asserted, for the first time, that the events \nas described in the report could not have happened because he was visiting his daughter \nin another state on the specified dates. In support of this assertion, Applicant submitted \nby email attachment three copies of photographs of him with his daughter. (AX X \u2013 AX \nAA.)  \n \n\n9 \n \n \nEach photograph is attached to the email as a \u201cJPG\u201d file, which is \u201ca computer file \nformat for the compression and storage of digital images.\u201d (merriam-webster.com.) The \nphotographs in the JPG files can be opened on a computer to view/print. The JPG file \nnames appear as \u201c10.26.14 Picture.jpg;\u201d \u201c10.30.14 Picture.JPG;\u201d and \u201c10.23.14 \nPicture.JPG.\u201d The email states that \u201ceach JPG can have the metadata shown by simply \nclicking on file info on the picture itself.\u201d The metadata includes the date, time, and \nlocation of where the picture was taken. (AX Y.) However, this type of metadata can be \nedited using widely available smartphone applications such as \u201cpixelgarde\u201d and \n\u201cmetapho.\u201d Applicant did not offer any other evidence to corroborate the dates his travel.  \n \nApplicant failed to properly disclose the 2014 and 2016 employment \nterminations on a security clearance application and in two background \ninterviews. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Alleges that when Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d on his e-QIP on November 1, \n2016, \u201cno\u201d to Section 13C, which asks: in the last seven years, have you been \u201cfired from \na job\u201d he falsified material facts by deliberately failing to disclose his terminations from \ntwo employers as set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n \n \nApplicant denies this allegation in his Answer and states:  \n \nI did not falsify information on the e-QIP. I do not believe I was terminated \nfrom this employer. If I was terminated I would have listed this on the e-QIP \nform. I did not deliberately fail to disclose anything.  \n \n \nIt is unclear from Applicant\u2019s Answer whether he is referring to the 2014 or the \n2016 employer. However, Applicant received a letter from his 2016 employer dated \nAugust 22, 2016, which stated that Applicant was terminated effective that same day. (AX \nK.)  \n \n \nApplicant also testified that he filed an ethics complaint with the 2016 employer to \ndetermine why he was terminated. \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: I don't see your ethics claim in here. Do we \nhave a copy of your ethics claim?  \n  \nAPPLICANT: No. I don't have a copy.   \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What was in it to your best recollection? What \ndid you allege? What was the concern?  \n  \nAPPLICANT: I wanted to know why I was fired, why they sent me home, \nbasically just to really find out what happened and then I received that letter. \n \n \nIn a November 24, 2014, email to HR, Applicant stated \u201cI have a right to know what \ninformation was submitted into JPAS on my clearance especially since it was \n\n10 \n \nrecommended that my accesses be revoked.\u201d When queried by Department Counsel why \nhe did not disclose the JPAS incident report on his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he did not \nknow what information was in the incident report and that \u201canything can be entered in \nJPAS for any reason.\u201d  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during a personal subject \ninterview (PSI) on January 25, 2018, when he stated that he did not know the reason for \nhis termination from the 2016 employer. \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant denies this allegation and contends that he did not know \nthe reason for his \u201ctermination.\u201d He testified that he did not find out the reason for his \ntermination until he received the Government\u2019s discovery in December 2018. (Tr. 49.)   \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during a PSI on November \n2, 2017, when he stated that he was laid off from his 2014 employment, but was in fact \ndeliberately concealing that he had been terminated. \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant denies this allegation and states: \n \nI was laid off from this employer and filed and collected unemployment for \nbeing laid off. The information contained in the SOR is false. I also made \nattempts to obtain the reason why I was let go from HR and other employees \nand was given no information at all. \n \n \nIn his 2017 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he was laid off for unknown \nreasons with about 30 other people. (GX 2.) In an email exchange asking a coworker to \nbe a reference, Applicant stated that he had told a potential employer that he had been \n\u201cdownsized\u201d because HR and Applicant\u2019s supervisor would not provide him with \u201cany \ninformation as to why I was let go, just that I was.\u201d (AX N.) On his 2016 e-QIP, Applicant \nlisted the reason for leaving his 2014 employer as \u201cunknown. Reason for termination was \nnever provided by employer. Unemployment claim was not contested. Reason given by \nemployer to [another state] unemployment office was I was laid off due to lack of work.\u201d \n(GX 1.) \n \n \nAs set forth above under SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant was called into the HR office and \ntold he was terminated. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on a resume that he \nsubmitted for employment in October 2016 when he reported that he obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from [a university] in August 2011 with a 3.8 GPA. \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted the resume for employment with Company C, where he \nworked from to October 2016 until October 2017 as an information systems security and \ntechnology manager. In his Answer, Applicant admits in part and denies in part SOR \u00b6 \n1.g. Applicant admits that he did not graduate from the university, and did not take any \nclasses there. He states that he enrolled with the intent of attending, and August 2011 \n\n11 \n \nwould have been his projected graduation date. He further states that he received the 3.8 \nGPA after transferring credits from \u201cprior training and military service\u201d to the university. \nApplicant also stated that it was not his \u201cintent to defraud or make a false claim of having \na bachelor\u2019s degree.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant also attached with his Answer a biography. The document is undated, \nhowever, he describes work experience through October 2017. Applicant states in the \ndocument that he dropped out of high school and then received a GED in August 2002. \nThere is no reference to any attendance of or enrollment in any college or university. (AX \nA.) \n \n \nIn his January 2018 PSI, Applicant confirmed that he had not graduated with any \ncollege degrees or taken any college classes within the last 10 years. When confronted \nabout the resume he submitted that stated that Applicant had graduated from [a \nuniversity] with a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2011. Applicant stated that he did not take \nany classes at the university, but that he did accumulate college credits for his military \ntraining and work experience. (GX 2.) \n \n \n \nIn his August 2018 responses to the Government\u2019s interrogatories, specifically \nwhen asked to provide copies of all college transcripts and diplomas for all completed \ndegrees, Applicant responded \u201cI do not possess any college transcripts or diplomas. I \nhave no completed degrees. I only have a GED.\u201d (GX 3.) \n \n \nHowever, Applicant also reported on his 2016 resume that he was enrolled in a \nuniversity in a dual Master of Science in Cybersecurity with a 4.0 GPA and a Bachelor of \nScience in Information Technology with a 4.0 GPA with an anticipated graduation date of \nApril 2019. (GX 6.) He testified that the university was primarily on-line and that he had \ncompleted approximately 18 courses. He further testified that he was in the process of \ntransferring his credits from this university and another (not previously mentioned) college \nwhere he had gotten credits for his military training to another on-line university starting \nin August 2019. He hoped to complete his degree by December 2019. (Tr. 110; Tr. 134-\n136.)  \n \n \nApplicant completed a talent profile as part of his job application for the employer \nto whom he submitted his 2016 resume. (AX H.) Under the education section, he did not \nlist the false information regarding his 2011 bachelor\u2019s degree and 3.8 GPA. However, he \nlisted the university with the dual master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s programs and stated that he \nhad been attending that university from January 2016 until the present. (GX 6.) \n \n \nWhen asked by Department Counsel why he provided this false information on his \n2016 resume, Applicant responded: \n \nAPPLICANT: I had placed it on my resume years ago and it had a \ngraduation date I think of 2011, and 24 then it was just -- it stayed on my \nresume.   \n \n\n12 \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Now why'd you put a graduation date in for a \nprogram that you never took a class in?   \n \nAPPLICANT: No I don't mean a graduation -- I mean like a projected \ngraduation date. (Tr. 58-59.) \n \n \nApplicant also offered testimony as to why his 2016 resume contained false \ninformation:  \n \nI remember enrolling in [the university] back in 2008, I transferred all the \ncredits I had there, which is where the GPA had come from. I had placed it \non an older version of my resume with the graduation date of 2011 and then \nI hadn't taken it off my resume.  (Tr. 114.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: Alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on a resume he submitted \nfor employment with [Company B] in April 2014 when he reported that he obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree from [a university] with a GPA of 3.8.  \n \n \nThe 2014 resume listed the city and state where the university was located, the \n2016 resume did not. The 2016 resume included a \u201ccompletion\u201d date of August 2011, the \n2014 resume did not. Additionally, the font and formatting are different on the 2014 and \n2016 resumes. \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant\u2019s response to this allegation is the same as his response \nto SOR \u00b6 1.g.  \n \n \nApplicant has failed to resolve the outstanding balance on his Company B \ntravel credit card \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Alleges that Applicant failed to pay a collection account of $1,528 on \na credit card issued by Company B in about October 2014, and that the account remains \ndelinquent.  \n \n \n \nThe debt is verified by a 2018 credit report, Applicant\u2019s statements during his \nNovember 2017 PSI, and his testimony. According to Applicant, the balance owed is for \nexpenses for his out-of-state travel for training in November 2014 and should have been \npaid by his employer. In his responses to interrogatories, Applicant states that the account \nwas paid. He testified that he submitted his expense report to HR prior to his termination \non November 17, 2014. He further testified that he has done online disputes of this debt \nmultiple times. He also stated that he has written multiple letters, faxed letters, and \ncontacted various branches of the financial Institute that issued the credit card and there \nis no record of his name or Social Security number in their systems. (Tr. 44-46.) Applicant \ndid not submit any copies of these dispute letters into the record. \n \n \nOn November 18, 2014, Applicant was provided with a form from HR via email to \nsubmit his expense report and receipts. On November 20, 2014, Applicant responded to \n\n13 \n \nHR stating that HR should receive the expense report by the following week. (AX N.) \nApplicant did not submit a copy of the completed expense report into the record.  \n \n \nOn August 20, 2018, Applicant submitted an online dispute with the stated reason, \n\u201cI have never paid this account late. My account balance is incorrect.\u201d (AX P.) In his \nAnswer, Applicant stated that the credit-card company will not accept any payments on \nhis behalf. He further stated that he has never been successful in disputing this account \nor having it removed from his credit reports but does not believe he owes the money for \nthis card. Applicant testified that the account has been removed by one of the three major \ncredit reporting agencies. (Tr. 44.) He did not provide any additional documentation \nregarding this account. This account remains unresolved. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Character Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted 13 letters of recommendation from: his current security \nmanager supervisor, direct supervisor, FSO, five coworkers, and the IT director of the \ncompany where Applicant has worked as a consultant since 2016; and his former \nsupervisor, platoon leader, and two coworkers. Collectively, the letters state that Applicant \nis a highly professional and trustworthy individual and recommend him for a security \nclearance. Additionally, 12 of the letters state that Applicant \u201cis always very respectful of \nprivacy, classified information, laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AX R.) \n \n \nWhile on active duty, Applicant received numerous medals and awards. He \nachieved or exceeded course standards in his service school academic evaluations. (AX \nB.) Between 2014 and 2017, he completed multiple cybersecurity certifications. (AX G.) \nApplicant received a positive work performance evaluation from his employer in January \n2017, wherein his supervisor stated that, Applicant \u201chas taken a leadership role in \ndocumenting new procedures to ensure compliance with new regulatory requirements\u201d \nwhile quickly assuming \u201call duties of the information systems security manager and \nalternate facility security officer with no difficulties.\u201d \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \n\n14 \n \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 15:  \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \n\n15 \n \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. The following \nwill normally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nThe Government has established by substantial evidence its prima facie case. The \nfollowing disqualifying conditions apply: \n \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and if \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n\n16 \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior;  \n \n \nand \n \n \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence establishes its prima facie case. Specifically, the \nJanuary 2017 letter from Company A to DSS delineating the findings of investigation into \nApplicant\u2019s conduct combined with the 2016 JPAS entry are sufficient to show that \nApplicant was culpable of labor mischarging and failing to perform his assigned duties \nand was terminated as a result. The 2014 report of investigation combined with the 2014 \nJPAS entry are sufficient to show that Applicant failed to perform his assigned duties, \nfalsely represented that he had performed such duties, both in a tracking log and when \nconfronted, and was terminated as a result. This evidence, and the overall record \nevidence, establish that Applicant made false statements and representations during his \nPSIs and on his e-QIP. \n \n \nThe 2014 and 2016 resumes and 2016 job application contain information about \nApplicant\u2019s educational credentials that Applicant admits is false. The 2018 CBR and \noverall record evidence show that Applicant is individually liable for the $1,528 delinquent \ncredit-card account and that the account remains unresolved. \n \n \n \nApplicant continues to deny that he was culpable of the conduct that resulted in \nhis 2016 termination. He supported this position by submitting the letter from the former \nFSO that refutes the January 2017 letter containing the results of the employer\u2019s \ninvestigation. The January 2017 letter states that the employer\u2019s investigation was based \non badging data, video evidence, network login data, and cell phone records. The former \nFSO states that this cannot be accurate because Applicant worked in a classified area \nwhere there was no video surveillance, badged entry, or network login, and that it would \nnot have been possible for the employer to obtain Applicant\u2019s personal cell phone records. \nThe FSO also states that following Applicant\u2019s termination, she prepared for a DSS audit \nand found all software patches were completed and audits performed. \n \n\n17 \n \n \nI find the letter from the former FSO to be unpersuasive. The former FSO was not \na party to the investigation and was not present when any of Applicant\u2019s alleged conduct \noccurred. The January 2017 letter does not specify the locations from which badging data, \nvideo evidence, and login data were collected nor does it specify what cell phone records \nwere collected. Applicant testified that a badge reader was installed on an external door \nshortly before he was terminated and that he routinely logged in to a network to use email. \nThe January 2017 letter indicates that after discovering that Applicant had failed to \nconduct required NISPOM audits, the employer completed all auditing and software \nupdates to ensure that no classified information had been compromised. This was part of \nthe investigation into Applicant\u2019s conduct and was performed prior to the conclusion of \nthe investigation. Further, the FSO has not worked for the employer since January 2019. \nIt is unclear under what circumstances she left, what her relationship with her former \nemployer is, and whether she has any bias toward Applicant or against her former \nemployer.  \n \n \nIn order to find that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion required to mitigate \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns, I would have to find the following to be true: \n \nIn 2014 and 2016, employees in supervisory positions at two disparate companies \nseparately conspired to create false records of investigation that contained \nderogatory information about Applicant, the two unrelated investigations each \nindependently determined that Applicant had failed to perform audits as required \nby NISPOM, the FSOs from both companies entered false derogatory information \nabout Applicant into JPAS, and the FSO of the 2016 employer reported false \ninformation about Applicant to DSS;  \n \nThe 2014 report of investigation was completely fabricated to include false \ncopies of emails, as well as recitations of conversations that never occurred \nand meetings that never took place;  \n \nThe January 2014 DSS report of its audit contains erroneous information \nand that same erroneous information is in the 2014 employer\u2019s \ninvestigation;  \n \nThe conclusions of the investigation set forth in the January 2017 letter from \nApplicant\u2019s 2016 employer\u2019s FSO to DSS were completely false; \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2014 employment did not require him perform any audits; \n \nThe false information about Applicant\u2019s 2011 bachelor\u2019s degree that \nappears on his 2016 resume in a different format and font and lists \nadditional information from the false information on his 2014 resume is \nbecause Applicant simply failed to remove the false information from the \n2014 resume when he created the 2016 resume;  \n \n\n18 \n \nIt was not Applicant\u2019s intention to defraud or make a false claim when he \nlisted the false information about his education on two resumes and a job \napplication; \n \nApplicant received a 3.8 GPA after transferring credits earned for prior \ntraining and military service, has completed approximately 18 courses in a \ndual master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degree program, but does not have any \ntranscripts showing his earned credit hours; \n \nApplicant did not know that he was terminated from his 2014 and 2016 \nemployers prior to completing his 2016 e-QIP, undergoing his 2017 and \n2018 PSIs, and completing his employment history on his 2016 job \napplication; \n \nApplicant properly submitted his expense report before he was terminated \nin November 2016 and has made extensive efforts to dispute the $1,528 \ncollection account. \n \n \nIn light of all the record evidence, I do not believe the above statements to be true.  \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and other record statements are replete with inconsistencies, \nomissions, and falsifications. He is not a credible, reliable, or trustworthy source. For \nexample, Applicant repeatedly stated that his 2014 employment did not require that he \nperform audits. He then testified that, in fact, he performed the procedures and policies \npart of the audits, which constituted approximately 90% of the audits.  \n \n \nFurther, Applicant cannot keep his stories straight about his education.  He did not \noffer any plausible explanation for why he falsified his 2014 and 2016 resumes or his \n2016 job application. He testified that he had listed false information on his 2014 resume \nand just \u201chadn\u2019t taken it off\u201d his 2016 resume. Yet, the font and formatting, and the \ninformation itself differs between the two resumes. In his January 2018 PSI, Applicant \nconfirmed that he had not taken any college classes within the last 10 years, but he listed \non his 2016 job application that he had been enrolled in a dual master\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s \ndegree program since January 2016. He testified that he has taken approximately 18 \ncourses in the dual degree program, has received college credits for his military training \nand work experience from another college \u2013 not the one listed on his resumes \u2013 and is in \nthe process of transferring all his credits to yet another university, but does not have any \ntranscripts.  \n    \n \nAn act of falsification has security significance independent of the underlying \nconduct. See ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). The mitigation of \nthe underlying conduct has little bearing on the security significance of the falsification, \nparticularly where there are multiple falsifications. ISCR Case No. 08-11944 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug 15, 2011). Previous inconsistent statements may be considered in assessing an \napplicant\u2019s credibility, evaluating evidence, and considering whether the applicant has \ndemonstrated rehabilitation, even though they were not alleged in the SOR. ISCR Case \nNo. 08-09232 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010.)  \n\n19 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing equivocations about the definition of \u201cterminated,\u201d about \nwhether he was terminated or laid off, about his knowledge that the 2014 JPAS entry \ncontained derogatory information, and about his educational background demonstrate \nthat he does not accept responsibility for his conduct.  \n \n \nApplicant continues to assert that he did not do what the 2014 and 2016 \ninvestigations state he did. He defends this position that he was not fired for cause by \nshowing that he successfully collected unemployment benefits from the 2014 and 2016 \nemployers. He also notes that the 2014 employer offered him another position after his \ntermination.  \n \n  \nHowever, Applicant has not pursued any avenue against either employer for \nwrongful termination. Even if Applicant did not actually know the specific reasons for the \nterminations until he received the Government\u2019s evidence, it does not explain why, if he \ndid nothing wrong, he failed to take any action to be reinstated or otherwise compensated. \nThis is particularly perplexing given that he has pictures which he asserts exonerate him \nof the accused wrongdoing that resulted in his 2014 termination.  \n \n \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s version of events to be plausible. The 2014 and 2016 \ninvestigations are not elaborate schemes created for the purpose of terminating \nApplicant. He failed to properly perform his job duties and got caught. I am also not \nconvinced that Applicant did not alter the dates on the photographs he submitted.  \n  \n \nFurther, regardless of whether or not Applicant was specifically informed by his \nemployers of the reasons he was terminated in 2014 and 2016, he had an obligation to \nbe candid and forthcoming on his e-QIP and during his two PSIs. He was aware of the \n2014 JPAS entry, as evidenced by his email to HR expressing concern over the negative \nimpact that the entry could have on his security clearance. He should have disclosed his \nknowledge of the JPAS entry to the investigators during his PSIs and his failure to do so \nraises security concerns.  \n \n \nApplicant has worked in cybersecurity and as an FSO and has held a security \nclearance since 2008. It is simply not plausible that Applicant did not understand that he \nwas required to be forthcoming about derogatory or security-relevant information of which \nhe was aware during his background investigation and the adjudication of his security \nclearance. His ongoing failure to accept responsibility for his actions, including his \ndeliberate falsifications and omissions, and his overall lack of credibility, raise significant \nconcerns about his ability to protect classified information. He has not met his burden of \npersuasion.  \n \n \nI find that Applicant intentionally falsified material facts on his e-QIP, during his \nPSIs, and to his employers. His 2014 and 2016 terminations were the result of his failure \nto comply with security requirements and ethical standards. He has failed to resolve a \ndelinquent account for which he is personally liable. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \n \n\n20 \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \n \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to \ninformation technology systems may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability to properly \nprotect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information Technology includes \nany computer-based, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to \nenable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nWhile Applicant\u2019s failure to conduct audits as required by NISPOM falls under the \ngeneral concern of Guideline M, none of the disqualifying conditions specifically apply. \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct is more appropriately analyzed under Guideline E, as \nset forth above. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \n \nApplicant has made intentionally false and misleading statements and omissions \nthroughout the security clearance process, and continues to equivocate about his \nconduct. His ongoing lack of consistency and clarity in recounting the details of his \nconduct and his failure to accept responsibility for his behavior remain concerns.  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines E and M, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \n\n21 \n \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his personal \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following formal \nfindings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E  \n(Personal Conduct):  \n \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M  \n(Use of Information Technology):  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He has held a security clearance since 2004 or 2005. He began working for his current clearance sponsor in December 2015. From November 2013 to December 2015, he worked for a different federal contractor. According to his SCA, he worked for a company that was not a federal contractor from December 2012 through October 2013. Prior to that, he was unemployed for a period of eight or nine months in 2012. He disclosed in his SCA that he was fired in April 2012 from his prior employment for \u201cjob abandonment.\u201d In that position, he was working in a combat zone in Country A. Since 2005, he had been performing similar work in Country A and in a second combat zone, in Country B. He has also worked in several European countries at various times during the 2005 to 2012 period. He has not worked overseas since 2011 or early 2012.

Dorman, Esq. \nJanuary 28, 2020 \nDecision \nGLENDON, John Bayard, Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guidelines G \n(alcohol consumption), F (financial considerations), and E (personal conduct). Applicant\u2019s \nevidence failed to mitigate these security concerns. National security eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 25, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking to renew a previously granted clearance. The Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) on May 25, 2018, setting forth 18 allegations that raise security concerns under \nthe three guidelines referenced above. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960); DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. \n2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \n\n2 \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, \n2016), effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \n \nOn June 16, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting 15 of SOR \nallegations. He provided with his response three documents. He requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn October 17, 2018, the case was assigned to me. The hearing was originally scheduled \nfor November 14, 2018. On November 6, 2018, Applicant\u2019s counsel entered her \nappearance. Three days later, she emailed to Department Counsel approximately 287 \npages of proposed documentary evidence. The email was received after business hours \non a Friday and Monday, November 12, 2018, was a U.S. Government Holiday. With only \none day remaining before the hearing, Department Counsel filed a Request for a \nContinuance on Tuesday, November 13, 2018, which I granted for good cause shown. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion and my ruling are marked as Hearing Exhibits 1 and 2, \nrespectively. After consultation with counsel, DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, \n2019, scheduling the hearing on May 21, 2019. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented eight \nproposed exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. \nApplicant offered 13 proposed exhibits, which, as noted, had been submitted to \nDepartment Counsel for review on November 9, 2018. Applicant\u2019s counsel had marked \nthose exhibits as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through M. Shortly before the hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted four proposed supplemental exhibits, which she marked as \nAE N through Q.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of all of the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits on the grounds of hearsay and lack of authentication, including \nApplicant\u2019s SCA and signed response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories (GE 1 and 3). \nThe other Government exhibits to which Applicant\u2019s counsel objected were four credit \nreports summarizing Applicant\u2019s credit status and recent credit history (GE 5-8), a JPAS \nIncident Report, dated September 5, 2014, (GE 2) reflecting Applicant\u2019s self-report of \nthree arrests for driving under the influence (DUI) and certain credit issues he was \nexperiencing at that time, and an FBI Identification Record (GE 4). I overruled counsel\u2019s \nobjections on the grounds that Applicant signed GE 1 and 3, which included \nrepresentations that the information he provided in the documents was accurate; that GE \n5-8 were admissible business records; and that GE 2 and 4 were admissible official \nrecords. I explained that Applicant was free to correct or update any information in the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted into the record without \nobjection. Applicant and four witnesses testified. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on June 5, 2019. (Tr. 10-11, 66.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a careful and thorough of the pleadings, the testimony at the hearing, and the \ndocumentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant, 38, is employed by a defense contractor performing design work. He \nhas held a security clearance since 2004 or 2005. He began working for his current \nclearance sponsor in December 2015. From November 2013 to December 2015, he \nworked for a different federal contractor. According to his SCA, he worked for a company \nthat was not a federal contractor from December 2012 through October 2013. Prior to \nthat, he was unemployed for a period of eight or nine months in 2012. He disclosed in his \nSCA that he was fired in April 2012 from his prior employment for \u201cjob abandonment.\u201d In \nthat position, he was working in a combat zone in Country A. Since 2005, he had been \nperforming similar work in Country A and in a second combat zone, in Country B. He has \nalso worked in several European countries at various times during the 2005 to 2012 \nperiod. He has not worked overseas since 2011 or early 2012. He earned a high school \ndiploma in 1999 and has participated in a specialized, week-long course in his field of \nemployment. He married his long-time girlfriend in 2016 after he submitted his July 25, \n2016 SCA. They have four children, ages, 12, 8, 6, and 5. (Tr. 15, 63-64, 71; GE 1 at 11-\n19, 25, 28-30; GE 2, GE 3 at 6.) \n \nGuideline G \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption and DUI Arrests, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.g \n(and Guideline E cross-allegation, SOR \u00b6 3.b): Applicant admitted each of the seven \nSOR allegations under Guideline G. In 2009, while working as a contractor in Country A, \nApplicant drank homemade wine for several hours in his employer\u2019s housing on a military \nbase. The alcohol content in the wine was high. While intoxicated, he drove to another \npart of the base where food was available. He does not recall the drive because of his \nintoxication. He was stopped by the military police and detained overnight. As a result of \nhis actions, his driving privileges on the base were restricted. He received no reprimand \nfrom his employer because, he suspects, his supervisor \u201chid\u201d the incident from the \ncompany\u2019s U.S. managers. Had the incident been reported to the managers, he was \nafraid that the incident would have resulted in serious consequences because his actions \nwere a violation of the U.S. Military\u2019s General Order No. 1 for all U.S. military and civilian \npersonnel working in Country A. After this incident, he stopped drinking alcohol for eight \nmonths to a year, but then resumed, even though it was not permitted. At times, he would \ndrink to excess and become intoxicated. (Tr. 73-75, 124-126; GE 1 at 39; GE 2; GE 3 at \n7.) \n \n \nIn early 2012, Applicant came home on leave and then deferred returning to his \njob in Country A due to a concern about one of his children. He and his wife, then-\ngirlfriend, had ended their relationship at that time. He was \u201cgoing through a hard time.\u201d \nOn May 16, 2012, he went to a bar \u201cjust to calm down\u201d and get out of his house. He felt \nintoxicated when he left the bar. As he drove his car onto the street, he was stopped by \nthe police for failing to turn on his headlights. His BAC tested at 0.13. He pleaded no \n\n4 \n \ncontest to a charge of DUI and was ordered to take a three-month alcohol course for first-\ntime offenders and to serve a three-year period of probation. He completed the course in \nDecember 2012. He stopped drinking alcohol for a while, but then began drinking again. \n(Tr. 69-70, 76-80, 126-128, 136-137; GE 1 at 40-41; GE 2; GE 3 at 7; AE M.) \n \n \nOn June 3, 2013, he was arrested again for DUI. He claims he took an Ambien pill \ndue to sleep problems and then had a verbal fight with his wife and started drinking \nalcohol. He does not recall what happened after that. He knows that he woke up in jail \nthe next morning. He was told that he drove his wife\u2019s car and hit a curb or a rock \ndamaging a wheel. His BAC was 0.14. He again pleaded no contest to the charge of DUI \nand was ordered to continue on probation until the end of 2018. He was also ordered to \ntake an 18-month, second-offender DUI course that met weekly. He was terminated from \nthe course for excessive absenteeism, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. Following \na court proceeding, he was reinstated in the course, and the warrant was dismissed. He \ncompleted the course in February 2016. According to GE 4, the FBI Identification Report, \nApplicant was also sentenced to serve 40 days in jail. During the probationary period, he \nknew that if he experienced another DUI conviction, he would be incarcerated for one \nyear. He believes that he would also go to jail for one year if he was convicted of DUI \nafter the termination of his probation. Applicant held a security clearance at the time of \neach of his three DUI arrests. He reported the two more recent arrests to his current \nemployer knowing that his security clearance would require renewal in 2016. (Tr. 69-70, \n76-80, 126-128, 136-137; GE 1 at 42-43; GE 2; GE 3 at 7-8; GE 4 at 2; AE M.) \n \n \nApplicant provided records of his alcohol courses and treatment. He has never \nvoluntarily entered AA or a similar program for persons who have problems with alcohol. \nHe continues to drink alcohol socially. He currently has no formal support network in case \nhe experiences a significant stressor and desires to drink alcohol excessively again. (AE \nL, M; Tr. 131-132.) \n \n \nApplicant was raised by alcoholic parents and learned to cope with them by \ndrinking alcohol, starting at a young age. He believes that he presently has a problem \nwith drinking \u201cto a certain extent.\u201d He has never been diagnosed as having an alcohol use \ndisorder. The last time he drank alcohol was one week prior to the hearing, when he and \nhis wife had a couple of glasses of wine at their home. He now drinks about once a month, \nusually with his wife at home. He last drank excessively at a friend\u2019s house three months \nprior to the hearing. His wife drove him home. He no longer drinks and drives and does \nnot drink around his children. As noted below, his wife testified earlier in the hearing and \ngave conflicting evidence, testifying that she last saw him drink alcohol six months ago. \n(Tr. 81-86, 133; GE 2 at 8.) \n \nGuideline E \n \n \nMarijuana Use, SOR \u00b6 3.a: Applicant admits this allegation. In March 2011, while \nhome on leave from his job in Country A, he drank an excessive amount of alcohol and \nwas severely intoxicated. While intoxicated, he smoked marijuana with a cousin. The next \nmorning, he did not recall the incident until his wife advised him what he had done. He \n\n5 \n \nheld a security clearance at the time. Applicant failed to disclose this use of an illegal drug \nin his SCA. In his March 2016 background interview, he reported that he had not smoked \nmarijuana since 2002, which was false. He failed to correct this misstatement in his \nresponses to interrogatories, though he made several other corrections and clarifications. \nIn a follow-up interview in December 2017, he disclosed the March 2011 marijuana use. \nHe testified that he has not used marijuana since this incident in 2011. (Tr. 60-61, 86-87; \nGE 3 at 9, 17.) \n \n \nGuideline F \n \n \nLate-Filed Tax Returns for Tax Years 2010 and 2011, SOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant \nadmitted this allegation. While working in Country A in 2010 and 2011, Applicant failed to \nfile his state and federal tax returns for tax years (TY) 2010 on time. When he returned to \nthe United States in February 2012, he had a month or two to file his 2011 tax returns. \nHe believes he filed for extensions while he was in Country A. He testified that with the \nhelp of a CPA, he filed his 2010 and 2011 tax returns in 2013 or 2014 and owed $3,500. \nHe provided no documentary evidence to show that he filed his TY 2010 returns. He \ntestified further that the IRS offset his tax refund for TY 2012 of $5,500 by the amount of \nhis unpaid taxes and fees for 2010 and 2011. Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D actually reflects that \nhe filed his TY 2012 federal return on October 3, 2013. This exhibit also shows that no \nrefund was due because he made no withholding tax payments that year. Also, Applicant \nprovided no evidence to show that he filed for an extension to submit his TY 2012 returns \non or before October 15, 2013. His evidence further shows that he filed his 2011 and \n2013 tax returns on May 29, 2014. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence fails \nto establish that he filed his TY 2010 returns and reflects that his returns for TY 2011, \n2012, and 2013 were not filed timely, though the SOR only alleged that Applicant untimely \nfiled his TY 2010 and 2011 returns. He has timely filed his subsequent tax returns using \na tax professional. (Tr. 102-105, 119-121; AE C, D, and E.)  \n \n \nMortgage Foreclosure, SOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant admitted this allegation. As noted, \nApplicant left his job in Country A and returned to the United States in or about February \n2012. He testified that during the following 18-month period, he was unemployed for about \n15 months. His SCA reflects that he was only unemployed from March 2012 to November \n2012. He and his brother, who also worked in Country A, had jointly purchased a home \nin 2007 (House 1) and jointly paid the monthly payments on a mortgage loan that they \nused to buy the residence. At some point, his brother decided to stop paying the \nmortgage, even though he was living in House 1 at the time with his girlfriend and her four \nchildren. As a result, Applicant had to continue paying the entire monthly mortgage. His \nbrother wanted to buy a new house, and Applicant loaned his brother $17,000 so he could \nbuy the house and move out of House 1. Applicant had significant savings from his job \nworking in Country A. He testified that his savings eventually \u201cran out\u201d and he could no \nlonger pay the mortgage. Government Exhibits 5 and 8 and AE A reflect that the last \npayment on this mortgage loan was in April 2012, shortly after Applicant returned from \nCountry A, left his job, and was unemployed. He testified further that he actually used his \nremaining savings to purchase a second house (House 2). He clarified that he \u201cpaid [the \nmortgage on House 1] until I found other - - another property to buy.\u201d In August 2012, he \n\n6 \n \npurchased House 2 for his family in a cash transaction without a mortgage loan. He was \nunemployed at the time. His financial resources were very limited after his purchase of \nHouse 2, and he sold the house in November 2014. The record is silent as to what he did \nwith the proceeds of the sale of House 2. (Tr. 87-91, 109, 112; GE 1 at 8-9, 15; GE 5 at \n5; GE 8 at 5; AE A at 9-10.) \n \n \nIn September 2012, the mortgage on House 1 went into foreclosure. The amount \nof the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan was about $260,000. The house was \nonly worth about $120,000. The foreclosure was completed in January 2013. Applicant \ntestified that before the foreclosure was finalized, he tried to do a short sale, but was \nunsuccessful. He also said, without any explanation, that after his default on the mortgage \npayments, it was too late to avoid the foreclosure on House 1. He did not provide any \ntestimony regarding attempts to rent House 1 before defaulting on the mortgage. \nFollowing the foreclosure, he was not responsible for the significant deficiency as a result \nof a state anti-deficiency statute. (Tr. 90, 115-116.) \n \nCredit Union Line of Credit Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $24,352, SOR \u00b6 \n1.c: Applicant admitted this allegation. In 2003, he obtained an unsecured $25,000 line \nof credit (LOC) from a credit union. He borrowed against the LOC and repaid it several \ntimes over the years. More recently, he borrowed about $24,000, possibly in connection \nwith his purchase of House 2 in August 2012, and has not paid anything to the credit \nunion since early 2013. The lender has charged-off the loan. Applicant testified that he \nintends to repay this loan in the future even though he believes it is no longer an \nenforceable obligation. He is unable to pay this debt at this time. (Tr. 91-93; GE 8 at 2; \nAE A at 5-6; AE B at 35.) \n \nBank Loan Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $16,417, SOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant \nadmitted this allegation. In 2007, he borrowed money to purchase a \u201ctravel trailer,\u201d which \nhe used as his residence whenever he returned to the United States from his work \nlocations abroad. He financed the purchase with a bank loan of about $16,000. His wife \nbecame pregnant with their first child, and Applicant wanted his family to have a house to \nlive in while he worked in Country A. As noted, he and his brother bought House 1 in 2007 \nfor his brother\u2019s girlfriend and her children. Applicant co-owned this house so that his wife \nand child could live in it as well. She only lived there for a brief period, choosing to live \nwith her mother while Applicant was in Country A. Applicant kept making payments on \nthe trailer until \u201ctimes became too tough,\u201d and in 2013, he voluntarily gave it back in a \nrepossession. The trailer was sold at auction, and Applicant is responsible for the \ndeficiency on the outstanding loan balance in the amount of about $7,390. He has made \nno payments on this debt since the repossession. (Tr. 93-96; GE 8 at 2; AE A at 11.) \n \nTwo Delinquent Credit-Card Accounts, Two Delinquent Cellphone Accounts, and a \nDelinquent Medical Account, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.i: Applicant admits these debts \nexcept SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g (cellphone debt for $91) and 1.i (medical debt for $2,102). Applicant \nprovided no evidence that he has paid the admitted debts, which total about $3,143, since \nhe submitted his June 2018 SOR response. He believes the medical debt and the \ncellphone debts have been paid. He provided no evidence of payments of these two \n\n7 \n \ndebts. He provided a large amount of evidence, but failed to specify the documents \nreflecting his payments of these two debts. After a careful review of all of Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentary evidence, I was unable to identify such evidence. Accordingly, these five \ndebts remain unpaid. He has made no payment plans with any of these creditors, nor has \nhe provided evidence that he has tried to contact them regarding these debts. (Tr. 97-\n100, 117; GE 6 at 3-4, 9; AE A at 8-9, 13-14.) \n \n \nApplicant has not sought any financial counseling, other than for the tax assistance \nhe received from a CPA. Since he married in 2016, he and his wife combine their finances, \nand together, they earn a significant income. They live in a modest home and do not have \nan extravagant lifestyle. (Tr. 63-64, 117; AE K, Q.) \n \n \nFour character witnesses testified at the hearing. Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor \ndescribed Applicant as reliable and hard working. She also described him as honest, \ntrustworthy, and a model employee, who consistently meets her deadlines. A co-worker \nand casual friend testified that Applicant does not have an extravagant lifestyle and \nspends his available money on his children. This witness described Applicant as \ntrustworthy and honest. Another co-worker and personal friend testified that he sees \nApplicant outside of work often. He believes that Applicant is trustworthy, honest, and a \nvaluable employee. He explained that Applicant and his family live as permanent \nresidents in a camping facility. He testified that Applicant has lived at the facility for about \na year and one-half so that he can save money to buy a house for his family. This friend \nstated that he has never seen Applicant drink alcohol nor has Applicant ever informed \nthis witness whether or not he drinks alcohol. (Tr. 14-22, 24-29, 31- 37.) \n \n \nThe fourth witness was Applicant\u2019s wife. She works as a licensed professional. \nShe has known Applicant for 15 years. During the period October 2011 to May 2012, they \nhad broken up as a couple. She and their two children at the time were living at her \nmother\u2019s residence. She testified that when he returned to the United States in February \n2012, they had \u201cbroke[n] up because he was out there, and so he quit his job to come \nhome.\u201d (Tr. 34-47, 61.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified about his criminal history related to drinking alcohol. He \nhad told his wife about his 2009 DUI incident when he was working in Country A. She \nwas not with him when he was arrested for DUI in 2012 during a two-week leave when \nhe was home, but she received a call from him the next morning asking to be picked up \nat the police station. She testified that he went to a bar by himself and drank too much. \nAfter this incident, he stopped drinking and returned to House 1. At that time, she did not \nreside at that house. She also testified about his third alcohol arrest in 2013 after they \nhad reconciled and were again living together. She said that he blacked out after drinking \nalcohol and taking an Ambien pill. She felt that his intoxication was the result of the \ncombination of the alcohol and medication and was accidental. She testified that he has \nnot consumed any alcohol for the last three or four years, though she also testified that \nshe last saw him drink six months prior to the hearing at a party. Her claim that he was \nabstinent over the preceding six months was contradicted by Applicant and is not credible. \n(Tr. 38-47, 57-58, 64.) \n\n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife also testified about Applicant\u2019s finances. His financial difficulties \nbegan in 2012 after he quit his job in Country A. He had previously obtained the LOC, \nand in 2013, he used funds from that account to purchase House 2. She also testified \nthat he \u201cpaid cash for [House 2],\u201d explaining that the cash came from his savings from his \nwork in Country A. She testified that he had no job for a period of about 18 months after \nreturning from Country A in February 2012. As a result, he sold the house and made a \nprofit. She did not explain why the LOC was not paid off when the house was sold. She \nalso testified that Applicant\u2019s debts started to increase during his unemployment. She said \nthat she was employed during this period. Since he became employed, Applicant has \npaid pursuant to payment plans the uninsured portions of medical bills he incurred in \nconnection with a surgery. He also paid off a credit card. Neither account is the subject \nof an SOR allegation. She testified that Applicant had a voluntary repossession of a trailer \nin 2012. She is unaware of the final status of Applicant\u2019s loan on the trailer. She testified \nthat she and Applicant had saved some emergency money by living in a camping facility, \nbut not enough to pay off his debts or to buy a house. (Tr. 48-55.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \n\n9 \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions potentially apply: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n\n10 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), (b), and (c). Applicant\u2019s DUI \nconvictions in 2012 and 2013, with the second one occurring while he was on probation \nfor his prior conviction, constitute alcohol-related incidents away from work. His 2009 DUI \nincident while working in a combat zone constitutes an alcohol-related incident at work. \nThe evidence also establishes that Applicant has a long history of abusing alcohol dating \nback to when he was very young. For many years, he drank alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment. He last drank an excessive amount of alcohol a few months before \nthe hearing. \n \n \nApplicant participated in two periods of alcohol treatment and education. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.f). Participation in such treatment does not constitute disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline G, and no disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that, notwithstanding those periods of treatment, Applicant \ncontinues to consume alcohol. However, the record evidence does not establish that \nApplicant was advised or told to abstain from alcohol during his periods of treatment. He \nwas also not diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. Thus, the allegation set forth in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g is not established as disqualifying conduct. AG \u00b6 22(f) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 1.g.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \n\n11 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was not so infrequent and did not occur under any unusual \ncircumstances to suggest that it is unlikely to recur. A significant amount of time has \npassed since his last DUI arrest. He was, however, under the restrictions of probation \nuntil late 2018. During the first year of probation, he incurred his second DUI. \nSubsequently, the penalty of further discipline while on probation kept Applicant from \nrepeating his criminal behavior of drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol. Now \nthat the probationary period has ended, Applicant may still face a serious penalty for a \nfurther incident involving drinking and driving, and that may constrain him to avoid such \nmisconduct. His problem with alcohol is not over, however. He continues to drink alcohol \nat home and socially, even to the point of intoxication at a party earlier in 2019. His failure \nto seek out and develop a trained support network, as in Alcoholics Anonymous, \nincreases the risk of future abuse of alcohol. Applicant\u2019s overall behavior with alcohol \ncasts doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 23(a) \nis only partially established. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges that he can no longer risk drinking and driving because \nthe penalty for that would no longer be just probation. He has modified his consumption \nand drinks alcohol at home with his wife in a reasonable manner and infrequently. But as \nrecently as a few months before the hearing, he drank alcohol excessively in a social \nsetting. Although he provided a large amount of documentary evidence, I was unable to \nidentify any evidence of any treatment recommendations. Accordingly, he has not \nestablished a clear pattern of compliance with any treatment recommendations. AG \u00b6 \n23(b) is only partially established. \n \n \nApplicant was ordered by a court to participate in an 18-month program for the \ntreatment of second-time DUI offenders. After a period of excessive absenteeism, he \neventually completed the program, but took no further steps to ensure that his modified \nuse of alcohol will continue through both stable periods in his life and periods of instability \nand stress. He does not participate in AA and does not have a sponsor or a person trained \nto provide the kind of intensive support as an AA sponsor does in the event of a significant \nbreakdown in Applicant\u2019s life. This presents a serious risk for someone who has a virtually \nlife-time history of alcohol abuse and undercuts a conclusion that he has demonstrated a \nclear and established pattern of modified consumption in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. AG \u00b6 23(d) is only partially established. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n\n12 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his SOR response, his testimony, and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns . . . as required.\u201d) Accordingly, further review is necessary. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts reflect a \ncontinuing course of conduct and, therefore, must be viewed as \u201crecent\u201d for the purposes \nof this Guideline F mitigating conditions. ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n16, 2017). Applicant\u2019s multiple, unpaid debts render them frequent. The only unusual \ncircumstance that Applicant encountered was that he came home from Country A in 2012 \nwith significant savings and spent those funds to purchase House 2 with cash, and \npossibly with funds borrowed on the LOC, while he was unemployed, rather than use his \nsavings to pay his bills while he sought employment. He could have rented a home for \n\n13 \n \nhis family and waited to buy a house once he found new, full-time employment. This \nbehavior, coupled with his failure to pay his delinquent bills once he was again employed, \ncasts doubts upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. In 2012 and part of 2013, Applicant experienced a \nlengthy period of unemployment and a further period of possible underemployment. Since \nthen, he has been employed and his wife has worked as well. In addition to choosing to \ndefault on his obligation to repay his mortgage loan on House 1, Applicant bought House \n2 using his savings. He also loaned his brother $17,000 so that his brother could buy a \nnew house. Applicant has not made payments on several debts that arose six or seven \nyears ago, even after he sold House 2. His mortgage lender suffered a significant loss on \nHouse 1 due to Applicant\u2019s immature actions, and his other creditors have been forced to \ncharge off his debts. He has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought out or received financial \ncounseling from a legitimate and credible source. Moreover, there are no indications that \nhis financial problems are being resolved or are under control.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. While Applicant claims that he has repaid some \ncreditors, Applicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to repay the long-overdue debts \nalleged in the SOR or to otherwise resolve these debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. While the record is unclear whether Applicant filed his \n2010 tax returns or why he did not file his 2011 and 2012 tax returns in a timely fashion \nafter he returned to the United States in early 2012, the evidence establishes that he did \nultimately file his 2011 and 2012 tax returns and pay his overdue taxes. He has also timely \nfiled his tax returns since then. His mistakes in filing his tax returns late a number of years \nago have been mitigated by his compliance with his tax obligations since then. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe following disqualifying condition potentially applies: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \n\n14 \n \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nThe record evidence establishes this potentially disqualifying condition and the \ngeneral security concerns referred to in AG \u00b6 15 regarding questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, in this case with rules regarding the \nuse of illegal drugs while holding a security clearance and criminal laws regarding drinking \nand driving. Though the evidence of Applicant\u2019s alcohol and financial delinquencies are \nalone disqualifying, his one-time use of marijuana in 2011 after having been granted a \nsecurity clearance may not be disqualifying if considered alone. When all of the national \nsecurity concerns raised in the SOR allegations as well as those cross-referenced in SOR \n\u00b6 3.b, and established by the record evidence are considered as a whole, there exists \nsignificant evidence that supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and \nother characteristics indicating that Applicant may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. AG \u00b6 16(c) applies.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. The offenses are not minor and are frequent. \nApplicant continues to drink to excess, and his financial delinquencies have been \ncontinuing for years, and therefore, are current. The record evidence supports the \nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s behaviors are likely to recur and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n\n15 \n \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G, F, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some of the factors in\nAG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed above, but other factors warrant additional comment.  \n \n \n \nI have taken into consideration Applicant\u2019s age and maturity, but I find his \ncontinued consumption of alcohol and his irresponsible handling of his finances to be \ninconsistent with his age. These behaviors evidence a lack of maturity. His character \nreferences attest to his integrity and character, but his actions are again inconsistent. \nSince the issuance of the SOR in 2016, Applicant has had sufficient time to take concrete \nsteps to obtain the help he needs to avoid future abuse of alcohol and to address his \nfinancial problems, but he has done neither. The limited steps Applicant has taken to \naddress the security concerns raised by the admitted SOR allegations are insufficient to \nmitigate the serious security concerns about his reliability and trustworthiness raised by \nhis long-history of immature behavior and significant errors in judgment.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, F \nand E, and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the record evidence in this \ncase. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption: \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c, and 2.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 2.d, 2.f, and 2.g:   \n \nFor Applicant \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n16 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 21, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, \n1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F, G, and H. \n(HE 2) On August 9, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3)    \n \nOn February 28, 2019, the case was assigned to another administrative judge. On \nMarch 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for March 22, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. On \nJuly 19, 2019, the administrative judge issued a decision denying Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. \n \nOn October 23, 2019, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the decision \u201cwith \nrecommendation that the case be assigned to another Judge for a new hearing and \nproceedings consistent with the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-01212 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. \n23, 2019). The Appeal Board also asked that three missing exhibits be included in the \nhearing file. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) N-P) \n \nOn November 7, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On November 21, 2019, \nDOHA issued a hearing notice setting the video teleconference hearing for December 18, \n2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 8 exhibits; Applicant offered 16 \nexhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 7-14, 16, 36-38; GE 1-8; AE A-P) The same exhibits were admitted at \nthe second hearing as were admitted in the original hearing. I granted Applicant\u2019s request \nfor additional time to submit documentation. On December 30, 2019, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing. I received two post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted into \nevidence without objection. (AE Q; AE R) The record closed on January 3, 2020. (Tr. 39, \n79) \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.   \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nAmendment to SOR \n \nOn November 13, 2019, Applicant received an amendment to the SOR. SOR \u00b6 3.a \nalleged under Guideline H that Applicant \u201cused Xanax, which was not prescribed to [him], on \nat least three occasions, until at least 2018, while [he] held a security clearance.\u201d On \nNovember 13, 2019, Applicant responded: \n \nI object to the amendment to the statement of reasons. I deny the amendment \nto the statement of reasons on the following grounds that my original charges \nwere dismissed and a lesser [charge] was pleaded to, therefore any evidence \nused against me in an amendment that [was] obtained from the original \ncharges should not be admitted because the original charges were dropped. \n(Tr. 65, 67; HE 3) \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nAn allegation in the SOR is not evidence but merely an allegation. An allegation in the \nSOR provides notice of the Government\u2019s security concerns. The Government has the \nobligation and burden to present evidence to support contested SOR allegations. An \namendment to the SOR is not contingent upon a finding of guilty in a criminal proceeding. \nAppellant objected to SOR \u00b6 3.a during his hearing. (Tr. 14-16) I overruled his objection to \nthe amendment, but reminded him that he would have a full opportunity to contest the \nallegation during his hearing. (Tr. 15) \n \nAdmissibility of Transcript of Previous Hearing \n \nThe Appeal Board ordered a new decision. I granted Applicant\u2019s request that the \ntranscript from the previous hearing not be considered. (Tr. 16) I advised Applicant that \nDepartment Counsel could ask Applicant questions about the content of the transcript; \nhowever, the transcript itself was not admitted as an exhibit and was not considered. (Tr. 17) \nAll citations in this decision are to the transcript of the hearing held on December 18, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.h, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. (HE 3) He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 3.a. He also \nprovided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior systems administrator working for a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) In 1992, he graduated from high school, and in 1996, he \ngraduated from college. (Tr. 19) He has never served in the military. (Tr. 19) He majored \nin computer science. (Tr. 19) He has never married, and he has four children who are \nages 13, 19, 23, and 25. (Tr. 18) Since 1996, he has been employed working for a defense \ncontractor without periods of unemployment until his security clearance was revoked on \nJuly 19, 2019. (Tr. 20) He has held a DOD security clearance for at least 20 years. (Tr. \n25, 71) There is no evidence of a security violation. \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s security clearance was revoked, he lost his employment with a \nDOD contractor, and he filed for unemployment. (Tr. 26) Despite having 20 years of \ninformation technology experience and a college degree, he was unable to find \ninformation technology employment without a security clearance. (Tr. 26) He found it \nheartbreaking to be unable to use his skills to contribute to DOD. (Tr. 26) On November \n1, 2019, he found employment, but now he has to commute 51 miles from his home on \ndangerous highways, and for reduced pay. (Tr. 26)  \n \nApplicant explained the source of his financial problems and why he should have \na security clearance: \n \nFor 25 years I\u2019ve performed my duties as a government contractor with prior \nloyalty and commitment. I was excited about the work I was doing as a \nsenior system administrator for the [DOD contractor] and looking forward to \nthe opportunities ahead of me with a top secret security clearance as high-\nperformance computing continues to advance. I was good at my job; my co-\n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nworkers held me with high regards. As you can see by the performance \nreviews and letters of recommendation provided.  \n \n*  *  * \n \nI\u2019m a good person who has made some mistakes, but I would never sell \nclassified information. I love my country; I may have [fallen] upon some hard \ntimes financially, been the sole source of income with dependent children. I \nmay have gotten into trouble when my mom was sick and the mother of my \nchildren left home after 20 years together. \n \nI was taking care of my sick mom and dealing with the pain of a love lost. I \nadmit my mistakes; I have learned from my mistakes, and I\u2019ve grown and \nmoved on from my mistakes. I am worthy of a top secret clearance, and I \nwill serve my country well with it just as I did with my secret clearance.  \n \nHowever, Your Honor, if you do [not] see fit for me to have a top secret \nclearance, I ask you [to grant my request] to keep my secret clearance, \nwhich was revoked, so I can find work closer to home and not have to travel \nup and down a dangerous highway. (Tr. 25-27, 35) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges the following financial allegations: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant owes $4,860 for a charged-off debt. Applicant \nincurred the debt to install floors in his residence. (Tr. 41) On March 22, 2019, the creditor \noffered to settle the debt for $2,916; however, the payment would have to be made by \nthe March 29, 2019, or the settlement offer would be null and void. (AE N) Applicant failed \nto provide any documentation showing that he settled this account or made payments to \nthe creditor. (Tr. 41-42; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.i allege that Applicant owes about $2,000 for a charged-off credit \ncard account. On March 22, 2018, the creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant for \n$1,838. (GE 7) Applicant settled this credit card debt after making two $800 payments in \nlate 2018. (Tr. 42-43; GE 3; AE E) On October 5, 2018, the creditor wrote that the debt \nwas settled. (AE E) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $927 for a telecommunications account \nreferred for collection. Applicant made some payments on this account, and he returned \nequipment to the creditor. (Tr. 43-45) On April 13, 2019, the creditor wrote the balance \nowed was $536. (AE O) The current remaining balance owed to this creditor is about \n$450. (Tr. 45-46; GE 3; GE 4; AE G; AE H; AE O) He would have made more payments \nexcept he was unemployed after he lost his security clearance. (Tr. 46) \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant owes $141 for his car insurance. He provided \ndocumentation with his SOR response showing that he paid this debt. (Tr. 46-47; GE 3; \nGE 4) \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant owes $102 for a medical account referred for \ncollection. Applicant provided a receipt with his SOR response showing that this account \nwas paid. (Tr. 47; GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant owes $21,777 in delinquent Federal income taxes \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016. In March 2015, a creditor forgave a mortgage debt for \n$25,526, and the IRS determined he received income when the creditor forgave this debt. \n(Tr. 48-49; GE 1 at 36-37; GE 2 at 29; GE 5 at 32; AE J) He also withdrew $24,000 from \nhis 401(k) account and was unable to repay his account in time to avoid a federal income \ntax penalty. (Tr. 48-49) In his December 21, 2016 SCA, Applicant stated he was in a \npayment plan, and he was making $228 monthly payments to the Internal Revenue \nService (IRS). (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 2 at 29) Applicant subsequently stopped making his \nmonthly payments. (Tr. 48; GE 2 at 29) His plan was \u201cto let them take my income tax \n[refund] in addition to [his] monthly payments.\u201d (Tr. 28; GE 5) \n \nAs of May 2018, the IRS tax transcript for tax year 2015 showed that Applicant \nowed $14,353. His 2016 tax transcript showed that his delinquent tax debt was $7,424. \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 tax refund was intercepted and applied to his delinquent accounts owed \nfor tax years 2013, 2014, and the remainder of $1,917 was applied to his debt for tax year \n2015. (GE 5) \n \nThe following table summarizes the tax information from state and federal tax \ntranscripts. Federal adjusted gross income is rounded to the nearest $1,000. \n \nTax \nYear\nFederal \nAdjusted \nGross Income\nTax Refund or Due \nState Refund (+S) State Due (-S) \nFederal Refund (+F) Federal Due (-F) \nExhibit \n \n \n2012 \n$69,000 \nGE 6 at 3; GE 5 at 1 \n2013 \n$65,000 \n$450 (+S); $1,578 (-F) \nGE 6 at 5; GE 5 at 2 \n2014 \n$66,000 \n$358 (+S); $2,109 (-F) \nGE 6 at 8; GE 5 at 4-5 \n2015 \n$129,000 \n$2,053 (-S); $14,259 (-F) \nGE 6 at 11; GE 5 at 6-7 \n2016 \n$90,000 \n$271 (-S); $7,450 (-F) \nGE 6 at 14; GE 5 at 8-9 \n2017 \n$73,000 \n$542 (+S); $4,086 (+F) \nGE 6 at 17; GE 5 at 10 \n \nFor tax year 2012, Applicant paid the IRS $385 in April 2014, resolving his tax debt \nfor tax year 2012. (GE 5 at 1) For tax year 2013, he made payments to the IRS in February \n2015, April 2015, and April 2016. (GE 5 at 2-3) His payments in August and September \n2017 were dishonored. (GE 5 at 3) In February 2018, the IRS transferred a $281 credit \nfrom tax year 2017, and his tax debt for tax year 2013 was resolved. (GE 5 at 2-3)  \n \nIn 2017, the IRS dishonored three payments toward his tax debt for tax year 2014. \n(GE 5 at 5) In February 2018, the IRS transferred a $2,695 credit from tax year 2017, and \nhis tax debt for tax year 2014 was resolved. (GE 5 at 5)  \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nFor tax year 2015, Applicant made $227 payments in April and November 2016. \n(GE 5 at 7) In February 2018, the IRS transferred a $1,917 credit from tax year 2017. (GE \n5 at 7) The balance owed was $14,353 as of May 25, 2018. (GE 5 at 6)  \n \nFor tax year 2016, Applicant made the following payments: $100 (August 2017); \n$200 (September 2017); $328 (October 2017); and $328 (December 2017). (GE 5 at 8) \nThe balance owed as of May 25, 2018, is $7,424. (GE 5 at 8) \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s federal income taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014 were \ndelinquent until Applicant\u2019s refund for tax year 2017 was transferred in February 2018. \n(GE 5 at 10) As of May 25, 2018, his tax debt for tax years 2015 and 2016 is $21,777. \n(GE 5) He did not provide proof of any federal income tax payments to address his \nongoing tax debt for tax years 2015 and 2016 after December 2017.     \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant owes $2,466 for a state tax lien entered against \nhim in 2017. On October 14, 2019, the state obtained a judgment against Applicant for \n$2,466. (GE 6) Applicant planned to gradually reduce the debt through the state taking \nhis refunds, and then he would pay off the debt when it was low enough. (Tr. 50; GE 5 at \n30) Applicant did not have a state-approved payment plan to address this debt. (Tr. 50) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant owes real estate taxes to a city totaling \napproximately $9,000 for tax years 2008 through 2016. Applicant stopped paying his real \nestate taxes in 2008. (GE 5 at 30-31) In 2016, he made $225 monthly payments for \nseveral months. (GE 5 at 31) In June 2016, he received a $9,000 bill for real estate taxes. \n(GE 5 at 31) Applicant said he is making monthly $50 payments, and he paid $51 in March \n2019, September 2019, and December 2019. (Tr. 51; GE 2; GE 5 at 31; AE I, AE J; AE \nR) \n \nApplicant\u2019s gross annual income was about $82,000 before his security clearance \nwas revoked. (Tr. 53) His adjusted gross income on his federal income tax return for tax \nyears 2015 and 2016 were anomalous because a creditor forgave a mortgage debt and \nhis withdrawal from his 401(k) account resulted in a higher income than he actually had \navailable to pay his debts. (Tr. 53) He started new employment on November 1, 2019, \nand his new salary is $70,000 annually. (Tr. 55) \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in March 2015 for speeding and \noperating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol (OVI). The police stopped \nApplicant for speeding, and they smelled alcohol on his breath. (Tr. 56) Applicant said he \ndid not remember his breathalyzer test or blood alcohol test (BAT) result. (Tr. 56) \nHowever, he conceded his BAT result was above the legal limit. (Tr. 72) The court record \nshows a .14 BAT result. (GE 8 at 1, 3) Applicant pleaded guilty to OVI first offense, and \nthe speeding charge was dismissed. (SOR response) Applicant was sentenced to a fine \nand court costs, 180 days in jail with 177 days suspended, and one year of probation. \n(GE 8 at 1) Applicant was required to attend a three-day alcohol awareness course and \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nhis driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months. (Tr. 56; GE 1; GE 2; GE 8; SOR \nresponse) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant was arrested in May 2016 and charged with OVI \nand physical control. Applicant had consumed some alcohol. He was on his way home, \nand he decided to pull over to the side of the road where he fell asleep. (Tr. 58-59) The \npolice arrived and arrested him. The police said he did not blow into the breathalyzer hard \nenough to register, and the police declared it to be a refusal. (Tr. 72) He pleaded guilty to \nphysical control, and the OVI was dismissed. (Tr. 59; SOR response; GE 8 at 5) He was \nfined, paid court costs, and placed on five years of community control. (Tr. 73; GE 1, GE \n2, GE 8) Applicant was unsure what \u201ccommunity control\u201d entailed. (Tr. 73-74) During his \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) interview, he said he was prohibited from having \nany similar incidents. (GE 2 at 26) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 2018 for physical control of \nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol. Applicant was moving his vehicle in the \ndriveway of his residence and honking the horn at his cohabitant who was inside the \nresidence. (GE 2 at 17) His cohabitant called the police. (GE 2 at 17) The police described \nApplicant as being \u201chighly intoxicated.\u201d (GE 2 at 17, 21) His speech was slurred, and he \nwas unable to stand without assistance. (GE 2 at 21) Applicant told the police \u201che had \nbeen drinking all day and night.\u201d (GE 2 at 18) He refused a breathalyzer test. (Tr. 73) The \npolice seized a Xanax pill that was in his pocket. (GE 2 at 18) Applicant was initially \ncharged with physical control and possession of drugs, but he pleaded guilty to an \namended charge of reckless operation, and the possession of drugs charge was \ndismissed. (Tr. 60-61; GE 8 at 7)  \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder. \nApplicant did not attend any Alcoholics Anonymous meetings or receive any other \noutpatient treatment for alcohol consumption. (Tr. 73) His most recent consumption of \nalcohol was 30 days before his hearing when he consumed two or three beers. (Tr. 74-\n75) \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 3.a that Applicant used Xanax, without a prescription, on at \nleast three occasions, until at least 2018, while he held a security clearance. When \nApplicant was arrested in April 2018, the police searched him and found a green pill inside \na baggie in his pants pocket. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) Applicant stated, \u201cOh, that\u2019s just my \nXanax.\u201d (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) Xanax is a Schedule IV Controlled Substance. Applicant told \nthe police that he did not have a prescription for the Xanax. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) At his \nhearing, Applicant said that he did not \u201chave any recollection\u201d of having Xanax in his \npocket when he was arrested, and he \u201cwas made aware of it when [he] read his [police] \nstatement.\u201d (Tr. 63) He did not remember telling the police officer the pill was Xanax. (Tr. \n75) Applicant suggested he may not remember what he told the police because he was \nintoxicated. (Tr. 75)  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nThe possession of Xanax charge was subsequently dismissed. Applicant admitted \nthat he took Xanax at least once as recently as 2018. (Tr. 67-69) He was uncertain how \nmany times he used Xanax, and he refused to estimate how many times he took Xanax \nwithout a prescription. (Tr. 67-69) He has never had a prescription for Xanax. (Tr. 71) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nThe mother of Applicant\u2019s children described him as a good provider and father \nfigure. (Tr. 29, 33) She has lived with him most of the time for 23 years. (Tr. 30) In the \npast year, he dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption because of health concerns \nrelating to high blood pressure and cholesterol. (Tr. 30, 33-34) She has not seen him \ndrink any alcohol for six months. (Tr. 31) They have not had any alcohol in their home for \nsix months. (Tr. 31-32) She does not use illegal drugs, and she is unaware of the \npresence of any illegal drugs in their home. (Tr. 32) \n \nFive coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends provided character statements \nsupporting reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. (AE A; AE B; AE \nC; AE D; AE Q) The general sense of their statements is that Applicant is honest, diligent, \nknowledgeable, intelligent, generous, courteous, loyal, respectful, kind, reliable, and \ntrustworthy. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D) His performance evaluations describe him as an \nexcellent employee who made substantial contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE \nK; AE L; AE P) He received salary increases in 2015 ($1,094) and 2016 ($1,034). (AE K; \nAE L)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record evidence establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant presented some important mitigating information. Applicant paid or \nsettled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.i. He made significant progress resolving \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He indicated his mother\u2019s illness and large family contributed to \nhis financial woes; however, he did not provide enough evidence that his financial \nproblems were largely beyond his control and that he acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances. His income from 2013 to present was relatively constant (excluding the \nforgiveness of his mortgage debt and withdrawal from his 401(k) account). He did not \nhave any periods of unemployment in the last 20 years prior to the revocation of his \nsecurity clearance. \n \nApplicant did not timely pay and has not paid his local real estate tax for 11 years. \nHis federal income taxes have been delinquent since 2013, and his state income taxes \nhave been delinquent since 2016. He did not make any payments to address the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He did not establish that he was unable to make greater progress sooner \npaying his tax debts.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he did not pay his federal taxes in full when due \nfor tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR \nmay be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nApplicant has not corrected his tax problems. The Appeal Board clarified that even \nin instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax \nproblem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such problems in the \nfuture, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light \nof [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information). In ISCR \nCase No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017), the Appeal Board reversed the grant \nof a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and observed: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nIn sum, there is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner resolving his delinquent tax debt and one delinquent commercial \ndebt. There are not clear indications his financial problems are under control. Applicant \nfailed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) apply; however, \u00b6 22(g) does not apply. Applicant had three \nalcohol-related driving incidents involving the police and/or the courts from 2015 to 2018. \nHis BAC for the first alcohol-related driving offense was .14. He was also very intoxicated \nat the time of his 2018 arrest. \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive \nalcohol use in the United States.\u201d See the Center for Disease Control website, (stating \n\u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a \npattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams \npercent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when \nwomen consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.\u201d), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-\nsheets/binge-drinking.htm. There are other definitions of \u201cbinge alcohol consumption\u201d that \ninvolve different alcohol-consumption amounts and patterns. He engaged in binge-\nalcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment. Even though he was arrested in \n2018 for an alcohol-related incident, AG \u00b6 22(g) does not apply because it was unclear \nwhat his five years of \u201ccommunity control\u201d after his 2016 alcohol-related arrest entailed. \nNo request was made that he contact the court and provide a copy of the requirements \nfor \u201ccommunity control\u201d to complete the hearing record. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption or responsible alcohol \nconsumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case \nNo. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial \nof security clearance for Applicant with alcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior \nto hearing). For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the \nAppeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat \nApplicant continued to drink even after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the \nJudge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (reversing \ngrant of a security clearance where most recent alcohol-related incident was three years \nbefore hearing because of overall history of alcohol consumption). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 18-02526 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2019) the applicant \u201cdrove vehicles \non three occasions while impaired by alcohol between 2000 and 2017.\u201d Id. at 4. The \napplicant participated in alcohol-related therapy and counseling, and he abstained from \nalcohol consumption for two years. Id. at 2. The Appeal Board emphasized the lack of an \nestablished benchmark period of abstinence from alcohol consumption stating: \n \nAs we have previously stated, the Directive does not specify how much time \nmust pass to mitigate the various types of misconduct identified in the \nadjudicative guidelines. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, the Board has \nrepeatedly declined to establish a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule for \nevaluating the recency of misconduct. The extent to which security \nconcerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question \nthat must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole.  \n \nId. at 3 (citing ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2019) (reversing grant \nof security clearance for applicant with three alcohol-related driving incidents with most \nrecent occurring in 2017). \n \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption in 2018, and he abstained from alcohol consumption beginning one month \nbefore his hearing. In 2015, he completed a three-day alcohol awareness course; \nhowever, he had two alcohol-related incidents after he completed the course. He has not \nhad any alcohol-related incidents involving the police or courts since April 2018. Not \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nenough time has elapsed since April 2018, when he was most recently involved with the \npolice in an alcohol-related incident, to enable a reasonable predictive judgment that his \nmaladaptive use of alcohol is safely in the past. He is not in a current alcohol counseling \nor treatment program. I have lingering doubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment pertaining to his history of alcohol \nconsumption. Alcohol consumption security concerns are not mitigated. \n  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance. . . ; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant held a security clearance for 20 years until at least April 2018. He used \nXanax at least once as recently as 2018. In April 2018, he possessed a Xanax pill which \nwas seized by the police. Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled \nSubstances Act, are contained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Xanax is a Schedule IV controlled \nsubstance. https://www.dea.gov/drug-scheduling. Xanax is a benzodiazepine and a \nprescription drug. \u201cTolerance can develop, although at variable rates and to different \ndegrees.\u201d See Drugs of Abuse, A DEA Resource Guide: 2017 Ed., at 59, \nhttps://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/drug of abuse.pdf. Xanax is used \u201cto treat \ninsomnia in patients with daytime anxiety.\u201d Id. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f) are \nestablished.   \n \n \n \n\n \n16 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He was honest about his abuse of Xanax. He has not \nresumed Xanax use without a prescription after 2018. There is no evidence of his \ncontinuing involvement with persons who use Xanax or any other prescription drug \nillegally. \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant did not present any \nevidence of drug-related therapy and counseling. Applicant\u2019s Xanax abuse is too recent \nand occurred while he held a security clearance. The discovery of his Xanax abuse \noccurred as the result of an alcohol-related arrest. The risk that Applicant may abuse \nXanax in the future cannot be ruled out. Guideline H security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n17 \n                                         \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F, G, \nand H are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior systems administrator working for a defense \ncontractor. In 1996, he graduated from college where he majored in computer science. \nHe has four children who are ages 13, 19, 23, and 25. Since 1996, he has been employed \nworking for a defense contractor without periods of unemployment until his security \nclearance was revoked. He has held a DOD security clearance for at least 20 years. In \nthe past year, he dramatically reduced his alcohol consumption. He has not consumed \nany alcohol for one month before his hearing. He does not have any alcohol in his home. \nFive coworkers, colleagues, and/or friends provided character statements supporting \nreinstatement of Applicant\u2019s access to classified information and indicating that Applicant \nis honest, diligent; knowledgeable, intelligent, generous, courteous, loyal, respectful, kind, \nreliable, and trustworthy. His performance evaluations and salary increases are evidence \nthat he is an excellent employee who made substantial contributions to mission \naccomplishment. There is no evidence of security violations. \n \nThe evidence against reinstatement of his access to classified information is more \npersuasive. Applicant has owed delinquent real estate taxes since 2008, delinquent state \nincome taxes since 2016 (tax year 2015), and delinquent federal income taxes since  \n2013 (taxes owed for tax year 2012 were paid in 2014; taxes for tax year 2013 were paid \nin February 2018, etc.). He has one delinquent commercial debt for about $4,860. See \nISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security \nclearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of \nnational secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a \ndirect bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation\u201d).  \n \nApplicant did not establish reasonable justification for his delay in making greater \nprogress sooner resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. His actions under \nthe Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little and too late to fully mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \n\n \n18 \n                                         \n \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol abuse from March 2015, to April 2018, and his misuse of Xanax \nwithout a prescription in April 2018, all while holding a security clearance are too recent \nand serious to be mitigated under all the facts and circumstances of this case. It is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 \nF. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances \nin the context of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations, \nalcohol consumption, and drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 3.a: \n \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guidelines for foreign \ninfluence (Guideline B) and financial considerations (Guideline F). The adjudicative \nguidelines cited in the SOR were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on \nDecember 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The case \nwas assigned to an administrative judge on May 2, 2019. The case was then transferred \nto me on October 8, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing by video teleconference \non November 7, 2019. The parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 24, 2019. Department Counsel proffered \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5. Applicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) \nA \u2013 C. (Tr. 11 \u2013 16) All exhibits were admitted without objection, and the record closed on \nNovember 20, 2019.  \n \n \nIn addition to GX 1 \u2013 5 and AX A \u2013 C, I included in the record three documents \nidentified as Hearing Exhibit (HX) 1 (Department Counsel\u2019s Discovery Letter, dated \nFebruary 14, 2019; 3 pages); HX 2 (Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administrative \nNotice re: Poland, with supporting documents, dated February 14, 2019; 5 pages); HX 3 \n(Correspondence and Emails re Exchange of Documents and Submission of AX A \u2013 C, \nand Department Counsel\u2019s Waiver of Objection to AX A \u2013 C, three pages. See also Tr. \n17 - 29); and HX 4 (Department Counsel\u2019s List of Exhibits, one page). \n \n \nAs to HX 2, that exhibit consists of the Government\u2019s request, supported by a fact \npaper from the U.S. Department of State webpage, that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts about the government of Poland and its relationship to the United States. I \nhave included HX 2 in the record and have considered its contents as requested by \nDepartment Counsel.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, the Government alleged that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen and \nresident of Poland, and that she is a major in the Polish army (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline \nF, the Government alleged that Applicant owes $13,930 for three delinquent or past-due \ndebts (SOR 2.a \u2013 2.c). Applicant has admitted all of the SOR allegations. (Answer) In \naddition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on all of the \ninformation before me, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, and was born and raised in Poland. He immigrated with \nhis family to the United States at age 13 and became a U.S. citizen in 1979. Applicant \nenlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1980 and served for four years as a radar technician. He \nfirst received a security clearance while in the military, and he was honorably discharged \nin 1984. Thereafter, Applicant worked for several different defense contractors in \npositions that required a security clearance. He embarked on other employment \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nopportunities in the information technology (IT) field until 2010. Between 2010 and 2014, \nApplicant worked as a federally-contracted Polish-English linguist in support of coalition \nforces at a forward operating base (FOB) in Afghanistan. Between March 2014 and April \n2017, Applicant was a self-employed computer repair technician before being hired as an \nIT technician by a health care organization. Applicant then was re-hired as a Polish \nlinguist by the defense contractor for whom he previously worked in Afghanistan, this time \nfor work in Poland. His assignment to an overseas job location is contingent on a \nfavorable outcome of this adjudication. (GX 1; GX 5; AX A; Tr. 36, 56) \n \n \nWhile working in Afghanistan in 2010, he met and began a relationship with a \nPolish army officer assigned to the same FOB. She was a divorced mother of one child \nand her home of record has always been in Poland. She was then, and continues to be, \na citizen of Poland residing therein. In September 2011, she and Applicant were married \nin the United States while he was home for two weeks of leave. Thereafter, both Applicant \nand his new wife returned to Afghanistan. On his return to the FOB, Applicant reported \nhis marriage to his supervisors and his company security manager, and he continued his \nwork at the FOB until the end of his rotation in November 2011. Before he could return to \nAfghanistan after that rotation, Applicant was interviewed on multiple occasions about his \nmarriage to a foreign national to determine if he was still eligible for classified work at the \nFOB. Applicant\u2019s mother and the rest of his immediate family have long been either \nnaturalized citizens or permanent resident aliens living in the United States. (GX 1; GX 5; \nAX A; AX C; Tr. 33 \u2013 36, 71 \u2013 73)   \n \n \nIn April 2012, Applicant again deployed to Afghanistan, where he would continue \nto work with a security clearance on a rotational basis until February 2014; however, his \nwife completed her military deployment and returned to Poland in October 2013. Applicant \ntraveled to Poland with his wife between November 2011 and February 2012. He also \ntraveled there to see her in March and November 2014, and for about three weeks in \nDecember 2014 and January 2015. Applicant\u2019s wife also traveled to the United States \nover the Christmas holidays in 2013. They have not seen each other since January 2015, \nand the only time they have communicated by phone or email since December 2016 was \nin May 2019. Additionally, a few days before his hearing, Applicant\u2019s mother received a \nphone call from his wife, who conveyed that she was retired from the Polish military. \nApplicant does not know what his wife does for a living now or how long she has been \nretired. On November 13, 2019, Applicant filed for divorce in a state court in the United \nStates. (GX 1; GX 5; AX A; AX C; Tr. 44, 47, 53) \n \n \nAfter he returned from Afghanistan in 2014, Applicant had difficulty finding work \nthat would enable him to provide him, his wife, and her child a good life in the United \nStates. They have been estranged since early 2015 because they had agreed she and \nher child would only immigrate to the United States if Applicant found employment \nsufficient to support them all comfortably in a house they could own. Applicant and his \nwife have never lived together in an established marital residence. (GX 1; GX 5; AX A; \nTr. 50 \u2013 52, 54 \u2013 59, 66 \u2013 70) \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nPoland and the United States are close allies in all respects. Our State Department \ncharacterizes that alliance as \u201cstalwart.\u201d Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s presence in Afghanistan with \nthe Polish army was due to Poland\u2019s cooperation with, and support of, United States \ngeopolitical efforts in Afghanistan and other parts of the world. Poland successfully \ntransitioned from being a Warsaw Pact nation within the ambit of the Soviet Union to a \nmember in good standing of NATO in 2000. Since then, it has been actively engaged with \nthe United States and the European Union in all facets of military and economic efforts in \nEurope. Poland is a leading trade partner in Eastern and Central Europe. Available \ninformation does not reflect any significant human rights or other issues, such as military \nor economic espionage directed at the United States by Poland. (HX 2) \n \n \nSince leaving his employment as a linguist in 2014, Applicant has experienced \nuneven employment and income-earning circumstances. As previously noted, his inability \nto find work that would support his wife and her child in the United States has been at the \nheart of the failure of his marriage. Additionally, available information shows that Applicant \nincurred numerous delinquent and past-due debts since about 2015. The debts alleged \nSOR 2.a and 2.b have been delinquent since the middle of 2015; the debt at SOR 2.c has \nbeen delinquent since 2018. Applicant acknowledged in his testimony that he has not \ntaken any action to resolve any of his debts. He also described other financial challenges, \nsuch as the need for him to provide financial assistance with family medical expenses \nover the years, and other recent unplanned expenses that have impaired his ability to pay \nhis debts and meet his current expenses. Applicant did not present any information that \nshows his current finances would be sufficient to both address his outstanding \ndelinquencies and avoid similar problems in the future. He has not sought any credit \ncounseling or other professional assistance in resolving his financial problems. (GX 2 \u2013 \n5; AX A; Tr. 37 \u2013 40, 59 - 66) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s work in support of coalition forces in Afghanistan put him at great \npersonal risk. Several times, the FOB where he worked came under hostile fire and on \none occasion he was injured during an attack. His work earned him praise from Polish \nand U.S. commanders, whose confidence he earned through his professionalism and \ndedication to the missions he supported. (Answer; AX A; AX B; Tr. 44 \u2013 45) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531)  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \nAvailable information regarding Applicant\u2019s marriage to a Polish army officer \nreasonably raised the security concern articulated at AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nMore specifically, that information requires consideration of the following AG \u00b6 7 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marriage to a foreign military officer potentially created a conflict of \ninterest between his duties in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. Even though \npart of that mission involved working with coalition partners such as Poland (thus the need \nfor a Polish linguist), Applicant\u2019s primary obligation was to protect U.S. interests. Although \nno information in this record showing that Poland poses a heightened risk to U.S. \ninterests, the closeness of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his foreign-citizen wife until at \nleast 2015 requires consideration of that possibility, especially because she is or was a \nfield grade officer in the Polish military. \n \n \nNonetheless, available information also requires consideration of the following AG \n\u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \n \n \nIn November 2011, Applicant complied with requirements that he notify his \nsuperiors of his marriage to a foreign national. Before he could return to Afghanistan later \nin 2012 to continue his work at the FOB, it appears that Applicant was vetted to ensure \nhe was still suitable for access to classified information and sensitive work overseas. He \ncontinued to work in that capacity without incident until early 2015 after several rotations, \nand after being subject to hostile fire by which he was injured on one occasion. Applicant\u2019s \nwife had returned to Poland in October 2013. She traveled to the United States to visit \nApplicant in December 2013. Between then and January 2015, Applicant and his wife \nsaw each other only when Applicant traveled to Poland in March 2014 and in November \n2014, and for about three consecutive weeks in December 2014 and January 2015. \nApplicant has not seen his wife since January 2015, and has only communicated directly \nwith her in December 2016 and in May 2019. Available information shows they are \nestranged. With the recent filing of a divorce petition, it is unlikely they will have any \ncontinued relationship that would present a conflict of interests for Applicant.  \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant has longstanding ties in the United States. His Polish-born \nfamily members all reside in the United States and are either naturalized citizens or \npermanent resident aliens of long standing. Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Air \nForce, and he continued to support U.S. interests as a civilian while holding a security \nclearance first granted more than 30 years ago. Applicant\u2019s most recent work in the \ndefense industry placed him at great personal risk while forward deployed to Afghanistan, \nand he was well regarded for his work there. All of the foregoing supports application of \nAG \u00b6\u00b6  8(a) \u2013 8(c) and 8(e), and is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe allegations at SOR 2.a \u2013 2.c were based on information showing Applicant \nincurred delinquent or past-due debts, totaling $13,930, and that, as of the date of the \nSOR, those debts had not been paid or otherwise resolved. That information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated, in relevant part, at \nAG \u00b6 18: \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nMore specifically, available information shows that Applicant incurred two of those \ndebts as early as 2015 and the other debt in 2017. He has not made any payments or \ntaken any action to resolve his debts. These facts and circumstances requires application \nof the following AG \u00b6 19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 pertain to these facts and \ncircumstances: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nIn view of all of the available information, I conclude none of these mitigations can \nbe applied. Applicant\u2019s debts are still outstanding and must be considered as recent. \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough his debts may have resulted from periods of unemployment, family medical \nissues, or other uncontrollable events, Applicant did not establish any good-faith effort to \npay his debts or that he acted reasonably in response to those challenges. There is also \nno basis for a legitimate dispute of any of his debts. Further, Applicant provided little \ninformation about his current finances that would suggest his financial problems are under \ncontrol, and he has not engaged in any financial counseling or other structured effort to \nimprove his financial health. The foregoing precludes mitigation of the security concerns \nraised under this guideline. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant is a loyal, naturalized \ncitizen committed to protecting U.S. interests over any others. He served honorably in the \nU.S. military and as a civilian contractor. All indications are that he has tried to be a \nresponsible and productive citizen for his entire adult life. Nonetheless, because his \nfinancial problems of the past five years remain unaddressed and largely unchanged, at \nthis time doubts remain about his suitability for renewed access to classified information. \nApplicant is encouraged to take tangible steps to improve his finances and resolve his \ndebts, so that these issues might no longer raise security concerns in the future. Until and \nunless that happens, and because protection of the interests of national security is the \nprincipal focus of these adjudications, the remaining doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability \nare resolved against the granting of a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 1.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n Paragraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the record as a whole, national security \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 4, 2014. On \nJuly 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline K (Handling Protected Information) and \nGuideline M (Use of Information Technology).

On December 13, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for January 9, 2019, and I issued an order to both parties to produce their \ndocumentary evidence by December 26, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 was admitted. Applicant objected to the admissibility of GE \n2, a polygraph examination report. I admitted it for limited purposes related to Applicant\u2019s \nstatements made and not the polygraph test result. Any polygraph results described \nherein were included to show the processing of the security investigation and not for the \n\n \n \n2\ntruth or accuracy of the polygraph results. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through M were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant and one witness testified. Hearing Exhibits (HE) I \nthrough IV were marked and made part of the record.

(Answer; Tr. 57-58, 96, 105; AE A) \n \n \nIn 2009, Applicant started working as a senior network engineer contractor at an \nagency within the DOD (Agency). At that time, Agency and its classified communication \nsystem (CCS) were undergoing a transition from a legacy network to a new architecture. \nCCS is the high-speed data, video, and voice network internet system for the intelligence \ncommunity (IC) and Agency is the caretaker of the system. Applicant was chosen to \nfacilitate the transition for some of the other, more established, engineers. In order to do \nthis, he had to learn the old network and the new network, which took him about a year. \nPart of the integration process included reducing 4000 IP addresses to roughly 100, and \nthere were no drawings of the old or new networks for the aggregation. Drawings and \ndiagrams are used by network engineers to encourage stability, redundancy, and \nresiliency on the CCS network. At that time, Applicant also worked as the liaison between \nAgency and the IC agencies who used Agency\u2019s CCS. (Answer; Tr. 58-61; AE A) \n \n \nAt some point, Applicant started producing templates to facilitate the changes \nbetween the old and new networks. His supervisors approved him bringing unclassified \nwork home to work on substantive issues. At no point did his supervisors express concern \n\n \n \n3\nabout this behavior. AE I and AE J are examples of unclassified work Applicant brought \nto his home. (Answer; Tr. 62, 100-101; AE I; AE J) \n \n \nOn June 10, 2015, Applicant took his first of four polygraph examinations. The first \nexam was for the five-year periodic reinvestigation for his TS/SCI security clearance. He \nwas admittedly nervous during the exam. Because the examiner determined that he had \na significant response to questions about sabotage, a second exam was conducted on \nJuly 6, 2015. No opinion was provided regarding Applicant\u2019s response to questions \nregarding intentionally mishandling classified information. (Tr. 58, 62-65; GE 2) \n \n \nAccording to the report, Applicant disclosed that he kept working papers at his \nhome, and they depicted internet technology infrastructure, schematics, communication \nroutes, and solutions for various defense and IC agencies. Applicant testified that he \ndisagreed with the polygrapher\u2019s record of his statement, and he believed the examiner \ndid not understand the scope of his work. At the hearing, he explained that he maintained \nclassified and unclassified notebooks of his work. AE G and AE H are examples of work \nhe kept in his unclassified notebook, and they were reviewed by Agency. According to \nApplicant, he tried to explain his work to the examiner and how he performed authorized \noutages, matured the network, and terraformed or touched every site in every region to \nprepare for the infrastructure. The classified diagrams were written in the classified \nnotebook, which he always left at his worksite. Applicant did not intend to give the \nimpression that he brought classified materials to his home. (Answer; Tr. 64-68, 70, 90-\n92, 98-99; GE 2)  \n \n \nAt the conclusion of the second polygraph exam, the examiner referred the issues \nto the investigations division and insider threat program within Agency. As a result, \nApplicant\u2019s home was immediately searched by Agency. Applicant accompanied the \nAgency employees to his home and did not have access to his home between the \ninterview and the search. At his home, he gave Agency employees access to his office, \ncomputer, and documents. Agency seized Applicant\u2019s personal computer, notebooks, \nand documents related to his work at Agency. He also gave Agency access to his \npersonal email accounts and server. Two days after the search of his home, he voluntarily \nbrought to Agency an additional hard drive that was missed during the search. In early \nSeptember 2015, all of Applicant\u2019s belongings were returned to him. It was determined \nthat none of his belongs contained classified information. Additionally, Applicant was \nunaware of Agency finding any classified information on his unclassified computer and \nemail account. (Answer; Tr. 64-69, 71-76, 89-90, 93, 99-100, 102-103; GE 2; AE E; AE \nG; AE H) \n \n \nOn September 28, 2015, Applicant was polygraphed a third time. Sometime \nbetween the first examination in June 2015 and the third exam, he was required to take \nhis annual training regarding the handling of classified information. The polygraph \nexamination report indicated there were no opinions given regarding Applicant disclosing \nclassified information. (Tr. 51-52, 68, 72, 75-76l; GE 2) \n \n\n \n \n4\n \nTwo days later, Applicant was given a fourth and final polygraph examination. \nAccording to the examination report, the examiner had no opinions regarding Applicant\u2019s \nresponses to questions regarding the handling of classified information. However, during \nthe post-test session, the examiner noted that Applicant stated that he routinely made \ndrawings of Agency\u2019s CCS, took them to his home, and plugged the information into a \nsimulator for testing purposes. Between five and ten times, he failed to fully redact the IP \naddresses. Applicant testified that this information in the report is not accurate, and he \ndid not intend to give the impression that the diagrams were classified, because they were \nnot. (Tr. 76-77; GE 2) \n \n \nDuring the post-test discussions following the fourth polygraph, Applicant \ndisclosed that on one occasion in 2013, he inadvertently left a folder containing IP \naddresses and site locations on an Agency shuttle bus. The bus was used to transport \nemployees from Agency\u2019s headquarters to a satellite location and to the employee \nparking lot. Several days later, he was able to find the folder on the bus, which remained \nin its zippered pouch. When he examined the papers in the folder he realized he failed to \nredact information. He was unsure if the information was classified, but it had the potential \nto be classified. He did not report this incident to his supervisor or to the appropriate \nauthorities at Agency because the papers never left the Agency compound, and he \nbelieved the incident was minor. This is the one and only time that Applicant brought \ndocumentation that might be considered classified out of the office. He also admitted at \nthe hearing that on four to five occasions, he may have failed to fully redact information, \nbut the documents never left his secure work location. (Answer; Tr. 77-83, 93-98) \n \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that the 2013 bus incident was potentially a \nsecurity violation, but he has had no other security violations. If he were to inadvertently \nviolate a security protocol in the future, Applicant would report it to his facility security \nofficer and the appropriate government authorities. (Tr. 83, 105-106) \n \n \nDuring one of the polygraph interviews, Applicant remembered that he sent an \nemail to himself from his unclassified work account to his personal email that he thought \nmight contain sensitive or classified information. While working at Agency, he worked on \nboth unclassified and classified networks and computers. In response to the examiner\u2019s \nrequest, he produced the email. At the hearing, he explained that the email contained \nnothing sensitive or classified, which was confirmed in one of his letters of \nrecommendation. (Tr. 87-90; AE F; AE L) \n \n \nFollowing one of his polygraph interviews, Applicant was asked to sign a \nstatement, which in part, indicated he had taken classified materials to his home. He \nrefused to sign that statement as it was written. In October 2015, Applicant\u2019s SCI access \nwas removed, and as a result, he could no longer work as a contractor for Agency. He \nwas not given the opportunity to further explain or address Agency\u2019s concerns. (Tr. 49, \n84-86; AE D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness (Witness), a government team leader at Agency, has worked \nas an active duty military member and a federal employee since 1983. He previously \n\n \n \n5\nworked in computer engineering, but he has worked in network integration for over twenty \nyears. Witness has held a TS/SCI with polygraph security clearance since 1987. (Tr. 37-\n39) \n \n \nWitness and Applicant were coworkers between 2009 and 2015, when Applicant \nwas removed from Agency. They interacted daily, and Witness was Applicant\u2019s team lead. \nApplicant and Witness were both engineers who were responsible for ensuring that CCS \nwas operational and data and video was successfully transferred. (Tr. 39-41, 60-61)  \n \n \nWitness reviewed the SOR, GE 2, and AE F, and in his opinion Applicant did not \nviolate classification protocol when he brought hand-drawn diagrams of the CCS system \nto his residence. The IP addresses alone were not classified, nor were the site locations, \nbut when the two elements are combined, they become classified under mosaic rules and \npotential compromise results in a security incident. According to Witness, network \nengineers at Agency worked at their homes to enhance their mission by studying or \npracticing routing protocols on their home computer or their home network. They did this \nto run different scenarios. Applicant had a program at home in which he could run different \nscenarios on how to use different routing protocols. \u201cOn those protocols the only thing \nyou need to do is input \u2013 you input IP addresses but you don\u2019t necessarily have to put \nyour production or your classified IP addresses.\u201d (Tr. 42-46, 51, 53-54; AE F) \n \n \nWitness was never aware of Applicant violating any security protocols. He had no \nconcerns as to Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a security clearance and to protect classified \ninformation. Applicant \u201chad a great reputation with his coworkers and with management \nbecause of his tenacity in building the network.\u201d Witness described Applicant as honest, \nintelligent, compassionate, hardworking, loyal, and possessing high integrity. (Tr. 46-51) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s three letters of recommendation, were written by former and current \nco-workers. They all reviewed the SOR prior to submitting their letters and had no \nconcerns as to Applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to classified information. They \ndescribed Applicant as highly trustworthy, reliable, and knowledgeable. Despite the \nissuance of the SOR, he remained in Agency leadership\u2019s high esteem. (AE K; AE L; AE \nM)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual work appraisals from 2006 through December 2014, \ndemonstrate that he consistently received positive reviews. During his years of military \nservice, Applicant received an Army Achievement Medal and a Good Conduct Medal. He \nhas also received multiple awards from his defense contractor employers, including his \nemployer at the time of the hearing, and the government agencies he supported.  (AE B; \nAE C) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n \n6\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K: Handling Protected Information \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n\n \n \n7\nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location; \n  \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling protected information, including images, on any unauthorized \nequipment or medium; and \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system. \n \nAccording to the October 2015 Polygraph Report, Applicant admitted that he took \nmaterials, which in the aggregate or mosaic, contained classified information to his home. \nAdditionally, on one occasion he sent an email to himself that also contained classified \ninformation.  \n \n \nApplicant at the hearing and in his Answer to the SOR, denied all of the underlying \nbehavior that was alleged in the SOR. He testified that he did not tell the polygraph \nexaminers that he violated security protocols other than the 2013 bus incident. Agency \nsearched his home and seized his personal papers and computer. There was no evidence \nbeyond the content of the polygraph report that Applicant possessed classified \ndocuments or information at his home or on his personal computer and network. Nor was \nthere any corroborating evidence that he improperly (in violation of his supervisors\u2019 rules) \nemailed classified information from his classified and unclassified work email accounts \nand his personal email account. Additionally, it appears from the record evidence, that his \nhabit of bringing unclassified work home or emailing unclassified components of his work \nto his personal email address was something his supervisors were aware of and \nencouraged.  \n \n \nThe 2013 security incident was not alleged in the SOR and was not considered in \ndetermining if the disqualifying conditions applied. In this case, Applicant credibly testified \nregarding his habits, behavior, and mistakes he made. His failure to report the 2013 bus \nincident in a timely manner, is concerning; however, he did report the incident during his \nfourth polygraph examination and there is no evidence of compromise or a pattern of \nviolations. The record evidence of a responsible, valued, and trustworthy employee \nsubstantially outweighs this mistake. Despite this incident and Applicant\u2019s subsequent \nfailure to timely report his mistake, I am left without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s credibility, \nhonesty, and trustworthiness. Applicant refuted the Guideline K disqualifying conditions. \n \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology: \n\n \n \n8\nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying. The record evidence established that the following are applicable in this \ncase: \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \n \nThe polygraph report provides sufficient evidence to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(d) and 40(f). \nApplicant refuted the Guideline M disqualifying conditions for the reasons stated in the \nprevious section. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \npertinent guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n9\n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines at issue in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant presented a \nstrong whole-person case. The record evidence establishes Applicant is highly \ntrustworthy, reliable, diligent, knowledgeable, and dedicated to mission accomplishment. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant refuted the \nsecurity concerns at issue. The totality of the record evidence leaves me without doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a clearance. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the \nUnited States to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is granted.  \n \n \n__________________________ \nCaroline E. Heintzelman \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and \nmitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial history. \nAccordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that his \ncircumstances raised security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017, apply \nhere. Applicant answered the SOR on July 18, 2018, and requested a hearing to establish \nhis eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n2 \n \nI was assigned the case on November 1, 2018. On December 14, 2018, a date \nmutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. Applicant testified at the hearing. \nThe Government offered three exhibits, which were marked for identification as GE 1 \nthrough 3, and which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered two exhibits, \nwhich were marked for identification as AE A and AE B, and which were admitted without \nobjection. The record was left open until December 28, 2018. Applicant timely submitted \none document, which was marked for identification as AE C, and which was admitted \nwithout objection. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and has a four-year college degree awarded in May 2012. \nHe has never been married and has no children. Since September 2017, he has been \nemployed by a defense contractor. This is Applicant\u2019s first time going through the security \nclearance process. (GE 1; Tr. 27.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history since he graduated from college follows:  \n \nJune 2012 - September 2012 (part-time pest control) \nOctober 2012 \u2013 March 2013 (unemployed) \nApril 2013 \u2013 February 2014 (part-time housekeeper) \nMarch 2014 \u2013 July 2014 (full-time metal sales estimator) \nAugust 2015 \u2013 December 2015 (full-time direct mail clerk) \nJanuary 2016 \u2013 August 2017 (part-time pest control) \nJuly 2017 \u2013 November 2017 (part-time retail sales) \nSeptember 2017 \u2013 present (full-time defense contractor) (GE 1.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 13 delinquent accounts totaling $51,045, of \nwhich $49,614 are student loans. (SOR \u00b6 1.) Applicant admitted all of those accounts, \nexcept for two medical accounts ($645 and $359), of which he denied any knowledge.  \n(Answer.) Those medical debts appear on the 2017 credit report, but the $359 debt does \nnot appear on the 2018 credit report. (GE 3; GE 2.) In his security clearance application, \nApplicant disclosed eight student loan debts, one medical debt, and one consumer debt. \nIn making those disclosures of student loan debts, he stated:  \n\u201cUntil recently, I didn\u2019t have an understanding or clear knowledge of the multiple \nloans and dollar amounts. Since pulling my credit report and going through it for this \napplication I can now approach how to move forward on this debt . . . . Contacting debtor \n[sic \u2013 he meant creditor] for payment arrangements.\u201d(GE 1.)  \nBy the time Applicant filed his Answer, he had payment plans in place for each of \nthe alleged student loans. (Answer.) By the time of his hearing, he had been adhering to \nhis payment plans or had otherwise resolved his SOR debts. (Tr. 39-40, 43, 47-50; AE A; \nAE B; AE C.) Applicant embarked on paying delinquent debts before he completed his \nsecurity application in 2017. (GE 1.) \n\n3 \n \nApplicant testified about the circumstances that caused his financial problems. He \nexplained that when he graduated from college, he had difficulty finding a good job. \nApplicant\u2019s current job is steady. Applicant testified that receiving the SOR \u201cincentivized \nhim to work on his [student] debt.\u201d Applicant embarked on paying student loan delinquent \ndebts before he completed his security application in 2017. (GE 1.) He began payments \non his student loan plans in July 2018. (Tr. 39, 54.) Applicant\u2019s post-graduate employment \nhistory above supports that explanation.  \n \nApplicant testified about his household finances. They are also set forth in a \nstudent Loan Rehabilitation Income and Expense form completed in July 2018 attached \nto his Answer, It and his testimony show that he is living within his means. Applicant is \ncurrent on all expenses and on his state and federal income taxes. (Answer; Tr. 50-53.)  \n \nApplicant submitted a character reference letter from his current supervisor. The \nauthor commends Applicant as being of \u201chigh moral character . . . reliable and \ntrustworthy.\u201d The author praised Applicant as one who \u201caccomplishes . . . tasks in a \nprofessional and proficient manner.\u201d (AE C.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n\n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n     (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. The next question is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply.   \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n\n5 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \n     creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n Although the SOR debts might have been incurred several years ago, they \nremained delinquent until Applicant filled out his security clearance application in \nNovember 2017. Nor are the delinquent debts infrequent; there were numerous such \ndebts. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant quite candidly explained that following his college graduation, he had \ndifficulty finding a decent job. His post-graduate employment history supports that \nexplanation. Even when he could find a full-time job, it only lasted for a matter of months. \nThus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied.  \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that Applicant acted responsibly under \nthe adverse circumstances he was facing.  When Applicant was alerted to the need to \naddress his delinquent debts during the security clearance application process in \nNovember 2017, he had only been on his full-time defense contractor job for a couple of \nmonths. He honestly admitted that the clearance process prompted him to begin to \naddress his delinquent debts. Often the Board does not look kindly upon applicants who \naddress their delinquent debts only when spurred by the security clearance process. \nSee,e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). I do not believe that to \nbe the case here. To begin with, this is Applicant\u2019s first foray into the security clearance \nprocess. Applicant persuaded me that he did not know the nature, extent, or the \nimportance of his credit-worthiness until he pulled a credit report in connection with filling \nout his security clearance application. He began addressing his delinquencies not long \nafter that. By the time Applicant received the SOR, and certainly by the time of the \nhearing, he had paid or otherwise resolved his delinquencies. The second prong of AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is satisfied. By the same reasoning, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies.  \n \nThe record does not raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9).) \n \n\n6 \n \n Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n            \n                             \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nPhilip J.

Based upon a review of the record as a \nwhole, national security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn February 26, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines for national security eligibility effective within \nthe DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 29, 2018 (Answer). He admitted \nsome of the SOR allegations, denied others with explanations, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me on May 28, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October \n16, 2019, setting the hearing for November 7, 2019. On that date, Department Counsel \noffered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence. Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. I took administrative notice of the facts concerning India and Saudi Arabia that \nare set forth in bulleted paragraphs starting on page 2 of the Government\u2019s two Requests \nfor Administrative Notice, which were marked Hearing Exhibits (HE) II and III for inclusion \nin the record. Hearing Exhibit I is the Government\u2019s Documentary Exhibits list. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 20, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He has worked for a major aerospace company since \n2007 as a manufacturing planner, and applied for a security clearance in order to qualify \nfor work on defense contracts. He was born and lived in India until age 23. He entered \nthe United States with a student visa in 1992, intending to remain and pursue a career in \nthe aviation industry. He and his second wife married in 1999, and have three children, \nages 22, 16, and 7. He has a 25-year-old daughter from his first marriage, with whom he \nhas little contact. All four of Applicant\u2019s children were born in the United States. His first \nwife, who he married in 1994, was a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Pakistan. \nHis second wife, who he married in 1999, was born in India and became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in 2018. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 37-39, 50-51.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his father, who is deceased, worked for the Indian national \ngovernment as \u201ca joint director. He said his father \u201cwas highest position in India,\u201d and \nserved as \u201cthe Director of Agriculture.\u201d (Tr. 57.) His father retired from that position with a \npension, and his mother continues to receive spousal pension benefits from the Indian \ngovernment. (Tr. 69.) From 2007 to 2012, Applicant\u2019s father and mother came to the \nUnited States to live with him and obtained permanent resident (green card) status. \nHowever, they preferred to live in India, and decided to move back. His mother is in her \nearly eighties, and intends to remain there. She lives there with one of Applicant\u2019s brothers \nand one of his sisters. He speaks with her once or twice a week, and sends financial \nsupport for her to his brother, averaging less than $500 per month on a semi-regular \nbasis. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is also a citizen and resident of India. His father-in-law is \ndeceased. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 42-46, 51-53, 67-69.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s six brothers and three sisters were all born in India. Three of his \nbrothers and his three sisters still reside in their family\u2019s hometown there. Applicant \ntestified that all but one of them, or their spouses, works in the private sector as doctors \nor engineers. One of the sisters is a homemaker who is not otherwise employed. Two of \nApplicant\u2019s younger brothers have moved to Canada and become citizens there. They \nalso work as engineers. His youngest brother is a pharmacist who maintains his Indian \ncitizenship but has lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for more than 15 years. Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nsaid that these three brothers, and possibly one of his sisters, have visa applications \npending and hope to move to the United States in the near future. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 34-\n35, 47-49, 66.) \n \n \nApplicant owns no real estate in India, but owns five different homes in the United \nStates, three of which he rents to tenants. One remains vacant because Applicant hopes \nthat one of his brothers will immigrate and live there. He and one of his daughters have a \njoint bank account in India containing the equivalent of several thousand dollars, which \nhe uses during his annual visits there. (Tr. 46, 49, 70-72.) \n \n \nNeither party produced witness testimony or documentary evidence concerning \nApplicant\u2019s character, work performance, or record of compliance with procedures for \nprotecting sensitive information. Applicant testified that he has two master\u2019s degrees and \nwill soon complete his dissertation for a PhD degree. He is seeking a security clearance \nto become eligible to apply for a manufacturing planner position within his company that \nrequires only an associate\u2019s degree and three years of related experience. (GE 1; GE 2; \nAE B; AE C; Tr. 38-40.) \n   \nI have taken administrative notice of facts concerning the states of India and Saudi \nArabia, as set forth on pages 2 through 7 of HE II, and pages 2 through 4 of HE III, \nrespectively. These facts are derived from and contained in U.S. Government publications \nreferenced in those hearing exhibits, and include the following: India is among the most \nactive foreign nations targeting U.S. aeronautical and other high-technology sectors for \neconomic collection and industrial espionage. Numerous criminal cases during the past \n12 years involved India-related espionage and illegal export of U.S. scientific information \nand technology. There are also significant concerns over ongoing terrorist and insurgent \nactivities, government corruption, and human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia is a monarchy \nwith numerous human rights issues and organized anti-American terrorist activities.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n\n \n \n \n \n4\neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 requires that the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two of them are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nApplicant has normal and commendable familial connections with his mother and \nhis nine siblings. He maintains weekly contact with, and provides regular financial support \nto, his mother who lives in India with two of his siblings. Three of his brothers, three of his \nsisters, and his mother-in-law are also resident citizens of India. Many of them and their \nspouses hold responsible civilian positions as doctors or engineers. Applicant\u2019s father \nserved in a high ministerial position for the Indian national government before retiring with \na pension, part of which his mother still collects. These relationships create a heightened \nrisk of foreign pressure, coercion, and exploitation because of his family\u2019s prominence \nand India\u2019s extensive economic collection and industrial espionage operations against \nsensitive and protected U.S. technology assets. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his relatives, \nand their positions in India, also create a potential conflict of interest between his \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and his desire to help family \nmembers living in India, should they be pressured, manipulated, or induced to obtain \naccess to such information. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to prove mitigation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s two brothers who live in Canada have become Canadian citizens, and \nhave no intention to return to India. His brother who lives in Saudi Arabia is a pharmacist \nwith no connection to either the Indian or Saudi governments. His relative obscurity and \nanonymity minimize the risk that his relationship to Applicant could be exploited or \nmanipulated to the detriment of U.S. national security interests. All three of those brothers \nare awaiting final interviews needed for approval of visas to move to the United States. I \nfind no security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s familial relationships with these \nbrothers, and any such concern would be fully mitigated under AG \u00b6 8(a) below. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nThose with potential application in mitigating the security concerns in this case are: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant did not establish that it is unlikely that he could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those \nof the United States as a consequence of his and his wife\u2019s longstanding and \ncommendable relationships with their family members in India. Those connections create \ncontinuing and significant potential for conflict of interest and risk of coercion, exploitation, \nmanipulation, or pressure. Applicant also has substantial connections to the United \nStates, including his immediate family and ownership of several homes. On balance, \nhowever, the evidence currently demonstrates significant potential for conflict of interest. \nAccordingly, Applicant failed to establish sufficient mitigation with respect to those \nrelationships under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), (b), or (c). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Guideline B security concerns do not \narise from any questionable conduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that are \nnormal results of his commendable family relationships, his family\u2019s prominence in India, \nand that country\u2019s history of targeting U.S. aeronautical and other high-technology sectors \nfor economic collection and industrial espionage. Applicant is a mature person, who has \nbeen a naturalized citizen since 2004. His wife and children are also U.S. citizens, who \ndo not hold Indian citizenship. There is no evidence or allegation that he has ever taken \nany action that could cause potential harm to the United States. However, his ongoing \nconcern for, and relationships with, his numerous family members who are citizens and \nresidents of India, create significant and ongoing potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant did not meet his \nburden to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised by the facts of this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. National security eligibility is denied. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \nDAVID M. WHITE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 25, 2017, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86). On September 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to \nApplicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR detailed reasons why \nthe DOD CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \n \nOn November 6, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to another administrative judge (AJ-1); on December 12, 2018, the \ncase was reassigned to a different administrative judge (AJ-2); on January 17, 2019, the \ncase was reassigned back to AJ-1; on March 13, 2019, the case was reassigned back \nto AJ-2; and on April 10, 2019, the case was reassigned to me.

I held the record open until \nSeptember 30, 2019, to afford Applicant an opportunity to submit additional evidence. \nApplicant timely submitted AE D through K, which were admitted without objection. On \nSeptember 13, 2019, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, with explanations, and denied SOR \n\u00b6 1.c, with explanations.

He seeks to retain his secret security \nclearance, which is a requirement of his continued employment. He has successfully \nheld clearances while employed by various defense contractors since 2000.  (Tr. 13-17) \n \nApplicant earned his General Educational Development (GED) certificate in \n2012. Since earning his GED, he has earned about eight college credit hours. (Tr. 18-\n20) Applicant married in 2006. He has an adult son from a previous relationship, and \nthree children with his wife ages 20, 18, and 11. All three children reside with Applicant \nand he financially supports them. Applicant\u2019s wife is employed part-time as an events \nplanner as a non-appropriated fund employee with the Coast Guard. (Tr. 20-24) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s responsibility for the four delinquent SOR debts, totaling $36,985, is \nestablished by his SOR Answer; his 2017, 2018, and 2019 credit reports; his 2018 \nOffice of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI); and his \nhearing testimony.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems trace back to his 2012 move to a high-cost location \nfor a better job and to provide an environment that would offer more opportunities for his \nchildren. After arriving at his new location, Applicant found that his living expenses \nexceeded his pay. His wife began working outside their home about a year after the \nmove, but not before their living costs resulted in excessive debt.  Additionally, in 2018, \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law stayed in his home for three months prior to open-heart surgery \nand during his recovery. Applicant\u2019s wife quit her job to care for her father. In addition to \nhis wife\u2019s loss of income during this three-month period, Applicant incurred incidental \nmedical bills and transportation costs on behalf of his father-in-law.

Applicant stated \nthat he filed his tax returns on his own for the first time using TurboTax and apparently \nmade a mistake. The state tax authorities caught the mistake and notified Appellant in \n2014. Applicant submitted documentation that he made payment arrangements in 2018 \nto pay down this debt at a rate of $50 per month. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted \ndocumentation that he is making payments in compliance with his agreement. (SOR \nAnswer; Tr. 31-38; AE I) DEBT BEING RESOLVED. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b - $8,009 charged-off automobile loan. When Applicant moved in 2012, \nhe sold his 2008 Toyota Highlander to an automobile dealer. However, after the sale to \nthe dealer, there was an $8,009 balance that remained payable to the credit union. To \ncover the balance, Applicant made an informal arrangement with his sister-in-law to \nmake payments to the credit union. Her payments to the credit union were to be in lieu \nof paying rent to him on the house he had built. His sister-in-law failed to honor her \nagreement, and the loan went into default. Applicant submitted documentation that he \nmade payment arrangements in 2018 to pay down this debt at a rate of $131 per month. \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted documentation that he is making payments in \ncompliance with his agreement. (SOR Answer; Tr. 38-47; GE 5; AE E, AE H) DEBT \nBEING RESOLVED. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c - $14,993 collection account. This is the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d. Applicant submitted documentation that this debt has been deleted from his credit \nreport. (SOR Answer; Tr. 47-49; AE E) DUPLICATE DEBT \u2013 DEBT RESOLVED. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d - $12,783 charged-off account for a personal loan. As noted, this is \nthe same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant submitted documentation that he made \npayment arrangements in 2018 to pay down this debt at a rate of $100 per month. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted documentation that he is making payments in compliance \nwith his agreement. (SOR Answer; Tr. 49-51, 65-67; AE E, AE J) DEBT BEING \nRESOLVED. \n \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a budget that reflects a net monthly remainder \nof $985. His budget lists all of his monthly payments to his SOR creditors. Applicant\u2019s \nbudget also indicates that he maintains a modest lifestyle and lives within his means. \n(Tr. 55-63; AE D) To improve his credit, Applicant retained the services of a debt \nresolution company. At some point in the future, the debt resolution company will \nassume making payments to Applicant\u2019s creditors. (Tr. 67-72; AE A \u2013 AE C, AE F) \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing credit report stated that all of his accounts are in good \nstanding. (AE E) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a character letter from a senior supervisor at \nthe military installation where he is employed. The letter favorably described Applicant\u2019s \nloyalty, dedication, work ethic, and trustworthiness. (Tr. 64-65; AE K) \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \n   \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal state, or local tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nThe evidence of record establishes concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f). Further review is necessary. \n \n AG \u00b6 20 lists six potential mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. His debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable in part. Although costs of relocating for a voluntary job \nchange do not come within the scope of this mitigating condition, Applicant\u2019s moving \ncosts certainly played a significant role in his financial difficulties. That said, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis applicable, in part, because of the costs associated with his father-in-law\u2019s open-heart \nsurgery post-recovery period, and his wife\u2019s loss of income.1  \n                                                          \n1 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) are fully applicable. Applicant recognized that his finances \nhad gotten out of control and set up payment plans with his state tax authority and two \ncreditors. He entered into payment plans with his creditors and has a track record of \nmaking timely payments with all three creditors. Applicant took the extra step of \nretaining the service of a credit repair company to improve his credit. His corrective \naction reflects a desire on Applicant\u2019s part to regain financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(e) \nis not relevant.  \n \nAlthough none of the three debts have been paid in full, Applicant is making \nprogress and has established his financial responsibility in a deliberate and measured \nway. With this in mind, the adjudicative guidelines do not require that an applicant be \ndebt-free. The Appeal Board has established the following basic guidance for \nadjudications in cases such as this: \n \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that \nan applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and \nquotation marks omitted). When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation, I view Applicant\u2019s corrective action to be responsible and reasonable. \nGiven his resources, he has initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of \nhis three SOR debts and is making a good-faith effort to resolve those debts.  \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep his \ndebts current. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis section under \nGuideline F is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are \nwarranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. Applicant\u2019s years of employment as a defense contractor \nwhile successfully holding a clearance weigh in his favor. He is a law-abiding citizen and \na productive member of society. He is current on his day-to-day expenses, lives within \nhis means, and his SOR debts are being resolved. He has provided evidence of being a \nproductive, loyal, and responsible employee. Applicant understands what he needs to \ndo to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution \nhave established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayment.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant responded to the SOR on an indeterminate date, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to other \nadministrative judges on January 30, 2019; May 16, 2019; and October 1, 2019; and \nreassigned to me on March 5, 2020.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on March 12, 2020. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 3 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. The \nobjection to GE 2 was sustained. Applicant testified, but he did not submit any \ndocumentary evidence. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted documents that I have marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough C and admitted without objection. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since May 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from \n1991 until he was honorably discharged in 1996. He is married with three adult children \nand an adult stepchild. ((Tr.) at 26-27, 38; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant earned a good salary while working overseas for a defense contractor \nfrom 2006 to 2008. He did not make as much upon his return to the United States. He \nand his family did not sufficiently adjust their lifestyle to their lesser income, and \nfinancial difficulties ensued. (Tr. at 18-19, 29-31) \n \n \nApplicant was unable to maintain his mortgage loan payments. He filed a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy case in June 2010. In December 2012, the case was closed \nwithout a discharge because Applicant failed to file a financial management course \ncertificate and a certificate under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1328 concerning his domestic support \nobligations. (Tr. at 31-34; GE 3, 5) \n \n \nApplicant needed additional assistance with his mortgage. He and his wife filed \nanother Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in December 2015. He was able to obtain a \nmortgage loan modification, and he stopped paying the bankruptcy plan. The case was \ndismissed in February 2017 for failure to make plan payments. Applicant and his wife \npaid $6,450 into the plan during the course of the bankruptcy. Of that amount, $4,000 \nwent to his attorney; $367 went to the trustee; and $2,082 was paid to his creditors. (Tr. \nat 33-34; GE 6)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases; $13,312 owed for the \nbalance due on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed; a mortgage loan that \nwas $23,638 past due; and two delinquent telecommunications debts totaling $1,574.  \nThe allegations are established through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant paid the two telecommunications debts in April 2019, and he is current \non his modified mortgage loan. He has been unable to work out payments for the auto \nloan. He called the creditor, who told him to contact the collection company. The \ncollection company told him they did not have his account. The most recent credit report \nlists a balance of $718, which is much less than the $13,312 balance listed on a \nprevious credit report. The larger figure may be the balance before the repossessed \nvehicle was sold, and the smaller figure may be the remaining balance. (Tr. at 20-25, \n31, 39-40; GE 3, 4, 7; AE A-C) \n \n  \nApplicant realized that he had to make changes to his finances. He will still help \nhis adult children if necessary, but not to the extent that he once did. He emphasized to \nthem that they have to be responsible for themselves. He has been working overseas \nsince July 2018. His wife has a good job. Their current finances are sound. He is able to \npay his bills, contribute to his 401(k) retirement account, and not accrue any additional \ndelinquent debts. The repossessed auto loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is the only account \nwith a balance on his March 2020 credit report. He has learned valuable lessons, and \n\n \n3 \n \nhe credibly testified that there will be no repeat of the conditions that led to his financial \nproblems. (Tr. at 19-20, 25-28, 35, 38-42; GE 3, 4, 7)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including two Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy cases, a repossessed car, a defaulted mortgage loan, and two delinquent \ntelecommunications debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant earned a good salary while working overseas for a defense contractor, \nbut he and his family did not sufficiently adjust their lifestyle to their lesser income when \nhe returned to the United States. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases were primarily to \nprotect their home. The first case was closed without a discharge because Applicant \nfailed to file certificates. The second case was dismissed after he obtained a mortgage \nloan modification and stopped paying the bankruptcy plan.  \n \n \nApplicant paid the two telecommunications debt in April 2019, and he is current \non his modified mortgage loan. He has been unable to work out payments for the auto \nloan, which has a balance of $718. His finances are otherwise in order. He is able to \npay his current bills, contribute to his 401(k) retirement account, and not accrue any \nadditional delinquent debts. \n \n  \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nApplicant had a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. The above mitigating conditions are sufficiently \napplicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 21, 2018, Applicant timely submitted a response to \nthe allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). His response included what was pre-\nmarked as exhibits A-L. \n  \nOn April 30, 2019, I was assigned the case. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 16, 2019, setting the hearing for \nJune 26, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government offered four documents, accepted without objection as exhibits \n(Exs.) 1-4; no objection was posed to Applicant\u2019s previously submitted documents A-L. \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nApplicant offered testimony, two witnesses, and six additional documents, accepted \nwithout objection as Exs.

He was offered \nprobation before judgment, with six months of probation completed successfully, and he \ncompleted a 12-week alcohol and drug outpatient program. \n \nIn April 2012, Applicant was with a group of friends drinking beer on a parking lot \nnear an apartment building. He was cited with Possession of an alcoholic beverage in \nan open container. Applicant then continued the evening imbibing with his friends. (Tr. \n61) The outcome of the citation was that Applicant was asked to perform 16 hours of \ncommunity service, which he completed successfully. (Tr. 39) \n \n \nIn September 2015, Applicant spent the day socializing with friends at a bar. \nAfter a late meal, he left the venue and was stopped by the police for swerving. (Tr. 36) \nThe officer smelled alcohol and Applicant admitted he had been imbibing. Applicant now \nbelieves he had consumed six or seven beers. (Tr. 34) He was given a field sobriety \ntest, which he passed, then administered a breathalyzer, the results of which were not \ndisclosed to him. Later, at the station, he refused a second breathalyzer. (Tr. 64) \nUltimately, he was arrested and charged with Driving Vehicle Under the Influence of \nAlcohol (DUI). At a bench trial, the judge found Applicant not guilty, noting that the issue \nshould have been settled when he passed the field sobriety test. Today, Applicant \nmaintains his innocence in the matter, but agrees \u201cit was unwise for [him] to put \n[himself] in that position. If [he] hadn\u2019t been drinking all that day, [he] would have never \nraised the officer\u2019s suspicion. And it was just not a smart move to even put [himself] at a \nvulnerable state like that.\u201d  (Tr. 35)   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \n \nIn mid-January 2018, Applicant spent the day at a bar for a going-away party. \n(Tr. 68) He got a ride to his grandmother\u2019s house, but later decided to retrieve his \nautomobile from the bar. After a field sobriety test, Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith Driving While Impaired by Alcohol (DWIA). He was pulled over for a headlight \nissue, and the officer suspected he was under the influence. Looking back at the \nincident, he now recognizes that he was intoxicated at the time. (Tr. 29-30) In court, \nApplicant was found guilty, sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended 60 days, and placed \non probation until late 2019. He became subject to an interlock system on his vehicle. \n(Tr. 72) His probation was terminated early, in December 2018, on petition after he \nfinished all other court-ordered requirements. (Tr. 31) He was initially advised by an \nattorney to cease using alcohol, then ordered to stop drinking by the court as part of his \nprobation. As of May 2018, he had not committed to remaining sober. (Tr. 73) As of the \ntime of the hearing, however, he feels committed to remaining sober. (Tr. 74)  \n \nAlthough he has does not follow the program\u2019s steps, has no sponsor, and does \nnot subscribe to the program\u2019s religious underpinnings, Applicant has attended over 140 \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, which he still attends. (Tr. 74-75, 79; Ex. M) He \nattended a one weekend inpatient program, finished 26 weeks of aftercare counseling, \nand completed a 16-hour on-line drug and alcohol education course. (see Ex. C, Ex. M, \nand Ex. N; Tr. 42) There, it was determined he had a \u201cmoderate drinking problem that . . \n. [had the] potential to be way worse if [he did not] get it in check.\u201d (Tr. 42) Elsewhere, \nhe was noted as a \u201cmoderate to high-risk\u201d drinker. (Tr. 43) Applicant described his past \npattern of drinking as being \u201cmore consistent with binge drinking.\u201d (Tr. 56) \n \nThis experience and subsequent rehabilitation have changed Applicant\u2019s attitude \ntoward alcohol abuse, and it is his intent to endeavor to remain sober and not return to \nalcohol \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d (Tr. 77) He no longer needs alcohol to have fun, \nand he recognizes that it adversely affects his judgment. Alcohol-free, he is enjoying \nnew hobbies, outdoor activities, and working on more fulfilling relationships. He is \ncurrently dating, but not cohabitating with, a woman who infrequently drinks alcohol. (Tr. \n51, 89) She is a caring individual who supports his sobriety and acknowledges that \nalcohol was adversely affecting Applicant\u2019s life. (Tr. 88) She encouraged him to make \nchanges in his life regarding alcohol. (Tr. 88) When they do move in together, they will \nmost likely keep alcohol in the home. (Tr. 51) Applicant stays away from all-day sports \nviewing in bars with his friends. (Tr. 77) He is contrite concerning his past alcohol \nabuse. (Tr. 53-54) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration. The AG requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe Alcohol Consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related citation and arrests raise serious questions \nconcerning his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment in terms of alcohol, judgment, \nand self-control. They, therefore, establish the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder.  \n \nThe security concerns raised under this guideline could potentially be mitigated \nby the following applicable factors:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he was deemed a high level to moderate drinker, \nand he self-described as a binge imbiber. It was sometime after May 2018 that he \ndecided to remain sober - for the \u201cforeseeable future.\u201d He has completed live and on-\nline \ntreatment, \ncoursework, \nand \ncounseling. \nHe \nhas \nfollowed \naftercare \nrecommendations. Although he does not follow the steps and sponsorship at the heart \nof AA, he does attend its meetings. While he has remained sober for the past two years \nsince his most recent alcohol-related incident from the 2010s, he has not done so \nwithout equivocation (choosing to comport his behavior for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d). \nHowever, his abstinence to date shows that he is capable of sobriety or self-control, \nalthough only time will tell whether his current pattern is sustainable. However, sufficient \nfacts have been raised to invoke AG \u00b6 23(b) and AG \u00b6 23(d). \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s four alcohol-related arrests and citation over the past decade are \nsufficient to establish the following disqualifying conditions: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \nHere, Applicant is contrite over his past criminal offenses. For many of the same \nreasons noted under Guideline G, he has demonstrated rehabilitation over the past two \nyears by remaining sober and not committing any more recent alcohol-related criminal \nconduct. He has also completed his period of probation from his most recent conviction \nfor driving while intoxicated. What remains a serious consideration in this particular \nmatter, however, is how successful his rehabilitation has been in terms of the length of \ntime he has demonstrated self-control or sobriety.  \n \nApplicant decided to comport his conduct sometime between May 2018 and the \nJune 2019 hearing. It is not unreasonable to expect a time passage for demonstrating \nchange to be as long, if not longer, than the space of time between cited incidents of \ncriminal conduct. Here, approximately two-and-a-half years passed between Applicant\u2019s \n2015 arrest and his most recent criminal charge in 2018. Therefore, a period of at least \nthree years since his 2018 arrest would prove a clearer gauge of his behavioral \ncomportment in terms of criminal conduct. Given his successful completion of probation \nand his continued participation in AA, however, I find AG \u00b6 31(d) applies, in part: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.  \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Here, Applicant was cited four times during the 2010s of alcohol-related \nmisconduct that jeopardized both his safety and the safety of others, and violated \nprevailing laws, rules, or regulations. This is sufficient to raise disqualifying conditions: \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicting that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) \nuntrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . and (2) any disruptive, violent, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) \nengaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \n \n \nThis guideline provides seven potential mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. One \nis potentially applicable under these facts: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2016. Two years later, he spent \nthe day drinking with friends and knew he was inebriated, but he decided to take control \nof an automobile. In doing so, he showed very poor judgment and reckless behavior.  \n \nThis was the most recent and last incident at issue. Applicant has acknowledged \nhis past personal conduct in terms of alcohol-related criminal conduct and poor \njudgment, and he has received appropriate counseling. For just over two years he has \nbeen practicing sobriety. This condition, however, relies on a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s \npast behavior is unlikely to recur. Despite his sincerity and contrition, Applicant did not \nmake his decision to move forward sober until May 2018. When he did so, it was a \ndecision limited to the \u201cforeseeable future,\u201d leaving room for doubt regarding the depth \nof his current commitment and regarding his ability otherwise to proceed in the future as \na cautious imbiber.   \n \n Applicant\u2019s most recent arrest and charge for driving while impaired was just \nover two years ago. It was his fourth alcohol-related citation in the past decade, and \nfollowed his last charge by about two-and-a-half years. Indeed, in the past 10 years, \nApplicant\u2019s drinking and the law have collided about every two-and-a-half years. A \ndemonstrated period of sobriety, or even moderate alcohol use, should extend beyond \nthe two-and-a-half year window that has resulted in pitfalls for the past decade in order \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \nto glean whether relapse to his old way is unlikely to recur. Based on the two periods \ndiscussed, that determination now would be premature.  AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.   \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under the \napplicable guidelines in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \ncredible testimony, the testimony of his witnesses, his background, age, education, \nbehavioral changes, and intervening maturation. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance vis-\u00e0-vis his personal conduct. The \nevidence persuades me that Applicant has matured sufficiently to comport his behavior \nwith applicable laws and regulations in general and, with the right incentive, to monitor \nhis drinking. Since Applicant has chosen to continue his present sobriety for only the \nforeseeable future, however, I conclude more time is needed to demonstrate that he is \nfully capable of independently monitoring his behavior with regard to his judgment and \npersonal conduct. Evidence that he has been able to break his regularly recurring cycle \nof committing some criminal or alcohol-related misconduct would go a long way to \ndemonstrate his maturation and improved judgment. Consequently, I conclude personal \nconsumption security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n         Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

On March 5, 2019, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, \nas amended (Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline B.  The SOR \nfurther informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 25, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2019. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on that same day, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on October 22, 2019. The Government offered three exhibits, referred to as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant \noffered no exhibits, but testified on his own behalf.  The record remained open until \nclose of business on November 5, 2019, to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional supporting documentation.  Applicant submitted fourteen Post-Hearing \nExhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 14, which were \nadmitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nOctober 31, 2019. \n \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe countries of Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.  Department Counsel provided a 6 page \nsummary of the facts, supported by 7 Government documents pertaining to \nAfghanistan, identified as HE 1.  Department Counsel also provided a 5 page summary \nof the facts, supported by 5 Government documents pertaining to Saudi Arabia, \nidentified as HE2.  The documents provide elaboration and context for the summaries.  \nApplicant had no objection.  I took administrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. \nGovernment reports. They are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to \nreasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old, is married, and has eight children.  He has a high \nschool diploma and/or GED and two years of college, and is currently applying for a \npositon as a Translator.  A security clearance is required in connection with this \nemployment with a defense contractor.    \n  \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan on April 21, 1975.  In 1982, at the young age \nof seven, Applicant and his family fled Afghanistan, because of the war, and became \nrefugees in Pakistan.  Applicant lived in Pakistan until 1992.  During that time, he \nfinished high school and two years of college in Pakistan.  He also learned how to \nspeak English.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Applicant then moved to Saudi Arabia, where he could find \nemployment to support his family and resided there from 1992 to 2004.  During that \ntime, he worked at a gas station and at a restaurant.  In 2004, the U.S. forces came to \nAfghanistan and the country became much more secure.  Applicant could speak English \nand so he applied for and was hired to work with the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  From \n2004 to 2008, Applicant worked as a translator for the U.S. military in Afghanistan.  He \n\n \n3 \n \ndid not have a security clearance, nor was he a U.S. citizen, and so his duties and \nresponsibilities were limited.  In 2008, Applicant came to the United States on a Special \nImmigrant Visa.  In 2009, he deployed to Afghanistan where he worked for the U.S. \nmilitary for 21 months.  Applicant explained that at some point, on a convoy or mission \nunder fire, an IED blew up underneath his seat.  (Tr. p. 53.)  He continued to do his job \nwithout faltering or showing fear.   \n \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014.  Since then, he has lived in \nthe United States.  Now with hopes of obtaining a security clearance, he plans to go \nback to work for the U.S. forces as a Translator or Linguist and provide unlimited \ninformation.  He presently works as a Lyft driver.     \n \n \nTo provide some background, Applicant married an Afghan woman in 1995.  \nTogether they have eight children, who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan.  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a green card and resides with their eight children in Afghanistan \nwhere the children go to school.  Since 1995, Applicant has spent only about six months \nout of every year with his family in Afghanistan and the rest of the year he spends in \nPakistan to work in order to provide for their financial support.   \n \n \nApplicant has nine siblings, five brothers, three who are citizens of Afghanistan \nand residents of Saudi Arabia.  He also has four sisters who are citizen and residents of \nAfghanistan.  One of his brothers is a citizen of Afghanistan and was a resident of India.  \nThis brother was going to school in India and working toward earning his Master\u2019s \ndegree in Business.  He recently returned to Afghanistan and is working for the \nDepartment of Agriculture.  Two of his brothers live in Afghanistan.  They are both \nphysically ill, unable to work, and are financially supported by their sons who are both \nteachers.  Three of his brothers are currently living in Saudi Arabia.  There are no jobs \nin Afghanistan and it is easier to find work in Saudi Arabia.  Two are working in a \nrestaurant and the other works for a touring company.  Applicant speaks to them about \nonce every three, four or six months, or on the holidays.  (Tr. pp. 33-34.)       \n \n \nApplicant has four sisters who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan.  They \nwould all like to come to the United States.  All of them are housewives.  None of their \nhusbands work for the military or the Government.  (Tr. p. 39.)  Since none of them \nhave cell phones, Applicant does not speak with them on any regular basis.  If he gets a \nchance to call one of their children, he may get the opportunity to speak to one of his \nsisters.  None of Applicant\u2019s nephews or nieces work for or are affiliated with the Afghan \nmilitary or Government.  (Tr. p. 40.) \n \n \nApplicant explained that his wife and eight children live with three of his brothers \nand their families on a huge family compound that they all inherited from their \ngrandfather.  (Tr. pp. 42-43.)  The house is divided into smaller apartment areas, but \nthey all own the property together.  None of the Applicant\u2019s sisters reside on the family \ncompound.  Applicant provides all of the financial support for his wife and children.  He \nprovides no other financial support to any of his extended family members.  Since 2008, \nApplicant has visited his family in Afghanistan every three or four months.  He provides \n\n \n4 \n \nno financial support to his siblings, or their families, as they either take care of \nthemselves or they do not need his help.        \n \n \nApplicant has no foreign bank accounts, but does own his portion of the family \ncompound in Afghanistan.  He has no family or property in the United States.  (Tr. p. \n53.) He has a bank account and a vehicle in the United States.  (Tr. p. 45)  He states \nthat next year, he plans to move his entire family to the United States, where all of his \nchildren will attend school.  (Tr. pp. 46-47.)     \n \n \nApplicant is uniquely talented.  He speaks 5 languages which include Farsi, \nPashto, Urdu, Hindi, and Arabic.  He also speaks 6 or 7 dialects of Pashto.  (Tr. p. 66.)  \nA number of laudatory letters of recommendation from defense contractors and \npertinent military personnel that Applicant has worked with and who have direct \nknowledge of his abilities attest to his experience as a translator, knowledge of the \ncountry, loyalty, professionalism, and great overall value he has given to the mission.   \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 9.)   \n \n \nApplicant has received a number of Certificates of Appreciation from U.S. forces \nfor his outstanding translator support and contributions to the missions.  (Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing Exhibits 10 through 14.) \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the information set forth in the Government\u2019s \nbriefs and supportive documents on the countries of Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia.  \n(HE1 and HE2.)  In summary, both countries provide a significant and heightened \nsecurity risk to the United States.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n\n \n5 \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s foreign family members include his spouse, his eight children, and his \nfive brothers and four sisters, and their families, who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan.  As Applicant explained, his brothers and their families live together on the \nsame compound with his spouse and eight children.  The family is close.  Based upon \nthe evidence presented, his foreign family connections clearly raise serious security \nconcerns and pose a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulations, \npressure, or coercion.  Given the violative situation that exists in Afghanistan, and the \nnature of the job Applicant is applying for, there could easily be a conflict of interest \nbetween Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information and his \ndesire to help his large immediate family as well as his large extended family in \nAfghanistan.  Under the particular circumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is \napplicable, and this contact as well as the nature of the relationships pose a significant \nsecurity risk to the U.S. Government.  Applicant has subjected himself to a heightened \nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest from his ongoing \nconnection with his family in Afghanistan.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s large family in Afghanistan, and the nature of his relationships with \nhis family, clearly pose a security risk.  There is a great potential for a conflict of interest.  \nAlthough Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, he has only lived in the United States \nfor five years, and does not have any family or assets other than a vehicle in the U.S.  \nAll of his family, for the most part, are in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia.  His house he \nowns with his brothers is in Afghanistan.  His relationship with them is close and \nongoing, and can possibly result in divided allegiance.  Insufficient mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has been established in regard to his family members.   The \nrelationship poses a heightened security risk particularly relevant to this proceeding.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant\u2019s close familial connections pose a \nsignificant security risk to the U.S. Government that has not been mitigated under the \nparticular facts presented in this case.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Meyer, Esq. \n \n01/21/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCurry, Marc E., Administrative Judge: \n \nAlthough Applicant has made some progress in reducing his delinquent debt, it is \ntoo soon to conclude that his finances are under control, given the length of time that his \ndebts were delinquent, and the recency with which he initiated the payment plans. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Lingering \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment and credibility, related to his explanation for failing to \ndisclose income to the state\u2019s unemployment compensation authority, compel me to \nconclude that he has not mitigated the personal conduct security concern. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn December 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national security \nto grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n\n2 \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On August 1, \n2018, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations in except 1.n through 1.r, and \nsubparagraph 2.c.  He requested a hearing, whereupon, the case was assigned to me on \nMay 10, 2019. On September 9, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued \na notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for October 9, 2019. The hearing was held \nas scheduled. I received eight Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 8) and five Applicant\u2019s \nexhibits (AE A - AE E), together with the testimony of Applicant. Also, I received a copy of \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s discovery letter to Applicant (Hearing Exhibit I).  At the close of the \nhearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request, to allow him the opportunity to submit \nadditional exhibits. On November 22, 2019, within the time allotted, he submitted 17 \nexhibits which I incorporated into the record as AE F through AE V.  The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on October 21, 2019. \n \nPreliminary Ruling \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 2.b alleges as follows: \n \nYou falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (eQip), executed by you on or about July 24, 2017, in response \nto Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities. You stated that you took a job at \nStaples, Inc. \u201c[t]o help maintain financial stability.\u201d You actually took the job \nat Staples, Inc. because your history of traffic citations meant that you could \nnot drive legally unless you were employed and need to travel to work. You \nlater admitted that you falsified your eQIP because you thought you would \nnot get a clearance otherwise. \n \nThe basis of this allegation is contained in an enhanced subject interview conducted \nin January 2018, encapsulated within a report of investigation (ROI) prepared by an \ninvestigative agent. (GE 2 at 8) When asked in interrogatories, propounded by the \ngovernment, whether the January 2018 ROI accurately reflected the information that \nhe provided to the investigator on the day he was interviewed, Applicant answered \n\u201cno,\u201d specifically objecting to the information in the ROI upon which SOR \nsubparagraph 2.b is based. (GE 2 at 5) In light of Applicant\u2019s denial, and absent any \nother record evidence on file supporting the allegation set forth in subparagraph 2.b, \nI resolve this allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. (E3.1.20) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 69-year-old single man. Since 2017, he has possessed legal \nguardianship of his ex-girlfriend\u2019s child. (Tr. 64) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 1970 \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979. (GE 1 at 13) Since February 2016, he has been working \nfor his current employer, a federal contractor, as a senior safety engineer. (Tr. 29)  \nAccording to a former coworker who worked with Applicant in the 1990s, Applicant was \n\u201calways responsible in all matters related to protecting classified material and would \n\n3 \n \ndiligently follow all rules and protocols to ensure the protection of classified material.\u201d (AE \nD at 1) \n \n \nApplicant has incurred approximately $90,000 of delinquent debt. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems began when he was laid off from his job in April 2015 as part of a \nreduction in force. (GE 1 at 7) He was subsequently either unemployed or underemployed \nfor the remainder of that year. Despite having $100,000 invested in a stock portfolio, \nApplicant exhausted these funds and fell behind on his debt payments. (Tr. 64) His \nfinances became delinquent in part because he chose to neglect them in order to help his \nex-girlfriend and her three children financially, providing them with several hundred dollars \nper month while he was unemployed. (Tr. 63-64; GE 2 at 18)  \n \n \nApplicant regained full-time employment in February 2016. He then retained a debt \nconsolidation agency to help him resolve his debts. (Tr. 16) As part of the agreement, the \ndebt consolidation agency agreed to contact each creditor, negotiate balance reductions, \nand develop repayment plans. (Tr. 16) Also as part of their agreement, Applicant was to \nmake monthly payments to the debt consolidation agency, and was not to negotiate with \nany of the creditors himself. (Tr. 16-17)   \n \n \nThe debt consolidation agency did not fulfill its responsibilities under the agreement, \neither not contacting all of the creditors, as promised, or not making the agreed-upon \npayments. (Tr. 18) In 2017, Applicant terminated his agreement with the debt consolidation \nagency and began attempting to resolve the debts himself.  \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.a is a credit card account totaling $16,947. In October 2019, \nApplicant negotiated a balance reduction and a payment plan. (AE E at 18) Under the plan, \nhe was to begin making $353 monthly payments, beginning in November 2019, \napproximately six weeks after the hearing. (AE E at 18) \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.b totals $14,913. Applicant disputes this debt, contending that \nhe has been unable to contact the creditor, or identify the type of debt. He suspects it was \na home equity line that was satisfied when he sold a home in 2017. (AE T at 3; Tr. 19) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c is a credit card, totaling $11,580. At the hearing, Applicant denied \nresponsibility for this debt. However, during the post-hearing record extension deadline, \nApplicant confirmed his responsibility for the debt, and developed a payment plan. Under \nthe plan, Applicant was to begin making monthly $323 payments, beginning in October \n2019. (AE Q at 1) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e are credit card accounts owed to the same creditor, \ncollectively totaling approximately $15,000. Applicant negotiated a settlement of \nsubparagraph 1.d for $2,644 and a settlement for subparagraph 1.e for $1,842. According \nto the two separate agreements, he was to have begun satisfying subparagraph 1.d with \n$440 payments, and subparagraph 1.e with $307 monthly payments, on November 20, \n2019. (AE H \u2013 AE I)  \n \n\n4 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f is a credit card totaling approximately $6,639. Applicant arranged \nto satisfy this debt in $350 monthly increments that were to have begun on November 23, \n2019. (GE L) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g is a delinquent credit card account totaling $3,541. Applicant \nsatisfied this account through a wage garnishment in September 2019. (AE E at 10) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h totals $3,174. It was charged off and reported \nas income to the Internal Revenue Service in tax year 2018. (AE J) \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i is a collection agent for a department store. Applicant\u2019s debt \nallegedly totals $2,359. Applicant contests the payoff amount, contending that it is actually \n$1,829. (AE T at 9) The collection agent filed suit against Applicant. Subsequently, he \nretained an attorney who successfully moved for dismissal of the case for defective service \nof process. (AE T; AE U at 9)    \n \n \nThe creditor in subparagraph 1.j is a collection agent for a department store. The \ndelinquency totals $1,298. Applicant has been satisfying this debt in monthly $106 \nincrements since February 2019. (AE M) \n \n \nThe creditor in subparagraph 1.k is a collection agent for a department store. The \ndebt totals $1,144. Applicant denied this debt, contending that he satisfied it. He provided \nconfirmation of satisfaction in his post-hearing submissions. (AE P) \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.l totals $15,082. Applicant admits owing money \nto this creditor, but disputes the amount, contending that the debt had been paid down to \n$5,892. Further, he contends that the collection agency\u2019s \u201cbusiness had been halted on a \nlegal challenge of improper debt manipulation, which included this account.\u201d (AE U at 10) \nHe provided no documentary evidence in support of this contention. \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m, as duplicated in subparagraph 1.n is a delinquent cable \ntelevision bill totaling $321. (AE U at 11) Applicant satisfied this debt. (AE K at 1) \n \n \n Subparagraph 1.o is a bill for the security system at Applicant\u2019s late mother\u2019s home. \nApplicant denies this bill, contending that as the trustee of her estate, he was not \npersonally liable for her debts. (Tr. 27) Nevertheless, he paid this debt. (AE U at 11)  \n \n \nSOR subparagraph 1.p alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 and 2016 on time. He attributes this failure to his continuing \nstruggles to get out of debt after obtaining his current job in February 2016. (Tr. 29) \nApplicant filed both returns in March 2018. He owed no income taxes for either year. (AE A \nat 32-37) \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q and 1.r allege that Applicant failed to file state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 and 2016 for three states where he lived during that period. \nApplicant denied these allegations. He lived in two states (State 1 and State 2), relocating \n\n5 \n \nto State 2 after losing his job located in State 1 in August 2015. SOR subparagraph 1.q \nalleges that he failed to file the 2015 income tax returns for State 1 and State 2. Applicant \nfiled these income tax returns in March 2018. (Tr. 29; AE A, Attachments (Att.) 9, 10) He \nfailed to file them on time, citing the same reason for failing to file his 2015 and 2016 \nfederal income tax returns on time. Ultimately, he was entitled to a $286 refund from State \n1 (AE A, Att. 9), and owed no money to the revenue authority of State 2. (AE A, Att. 9 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant lived in State 2 from August 2015 to December 2015. (AE U at 12) When \nhe obtained his current job in January 2016, he relocated from State 2 to the state where \nhe currently lives. (State 3) Applicant had no responsibility to file an income tax return in \nState 2 for 2016 because he did not live there that year.  \n \n \nApplicant has not yet filed his State 3 income tax return for 2016, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.s. With the help of a professional tax return preparer, he completed it in \nMarch 2018; however, he did not file it then because of what he alleged to be a \ndiscrepancy in the amount owed. Specifically, the return, as completed by the preparer, \nindicates that Applicant owes State 3 $3,178, whereas, Applicant contends that he is owed \na refund. (AE A, Att. 11 at 3; AE U at 12) Applicant contends that dispute is being \ninvestigated. He provided no evidence of any investigation.  \n \n \nApplicant maintains a budget. (GE 2 at 19) He earns $113,000 per year. (Tr. 55) He \nreceives $352 in monthly pension payments stemming from two previous jobs. (GE 2 at 9) \nHe has $1,650 in monthly disposable income.  \n \n \nApplicant has received between 17 and 20 traffic citations in the past 7 years. Many \nof the tickets stemmed from driving an automobile with expired registration. Specifically, \nwhen Applicant relocated from State 2, he took with him two vehicles that he owned. (Tr. \n38) The registration for one of the vehicles had expired. Struggling to make ends meet, \nApplicant only registered one vehicle after relocating. Most of the time, he left the \nunregistered vehicle parked on a private driveway, legally off the streets of State 3. \nOccasionally, however, if the registered vehicle was broken down and he did not have the \nmoney to repair it, he would drive the unregistered vehicle instead. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 10) \nPeriodically, while driving the unregistered vehicle, he would get stopped and ticketed. \nApplicant received the majority of these tickets for driving an unregistered vehicle while \ncommuting to and from work. (Tr. 37, 99) He prioritized work attendance, preferring to \noccasionally commute with an unregistered vehicle, over paying to register his vehicle. (Tr. \n37) The cost for registering a vehicle in State 3 is approximately $150 per year. (Tr. 102) \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s traffic citations include fines for driving with an expired driver\u2019s license. \nWhile living in State 2, Applicant was stopped and issued citations for operating a car \nwithout a valid registration and without a valid driver\u2019s license in 2015. (GE 2 at 10) As a \nresult of these citations, his vehicle was impounded. Applicant obtained a temporary \nregistration, but did not apply for a new driver\u2019s license. He failed to do so because he \ncould not afford the registration fee. (GE 2 at 10) \n \n\n6 \n \n \nLater in 2015, Applicant applied for unemployment benefits. When completing the \napplication, he forgot to disclose his monthly pension income. ($352) Upon realizing his \nmistake, he contacted his caseworker and disclosed the pension income. The caseworker \ntold him that it was nominal, and would have no effect on the amount of unemployment \ncompensation that he would receive. (Tr. 46) When Applicant obtained his part-time job \nlater that year, he did not report the income to the unemployment office. Consequently, he \nwas charged with the crime of misrepresentation of income to obtain unemployment \nbenefits.  (Tr. 92) As part of a settlement, Applicant was ordered to pay $4,000 in \noverpayment expenses. (Tr. 93) \n \n \nApplicant contends that he did not report the money from the part-time job because \nthe income was nominal, similar to the pension income that he was told that he did not \nneed to report. During cross-examination, he testified that the overpayment totaled slightly \nmore than $4,000, an amount \u201cmuch more than the payments that [he] got from [his ex-\nemployer].\u201d (Tr. 94) He disclosed his failure to report the part-time income and its \nconsequences, vis a vis his unemployment benefits, in depth on his 2017 security \nclearance application.   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n7 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s outstanding income tax debt owed to State 3 for 2016 triggers the \napplication of AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for \nthe problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n\n8 \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant was either unemployed or underemployed for ten months in 2015. Before \nthen, he had no financial problems. When Applicant lost his job, he had rainy day income \ninvested in a stock portfolio totaling $100,000. He admittedly could have done a better job \nof keeping his debts under control while unemployed, but deliberately chose to neglect \nthem in favor of supporting his ex-girlfriend and her children, paying them hundreds of \ndollars per month during his unemployment. Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed from circumstances beyond his control. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is inapplicable.   \n \n \nApplicant provided proof supporting his contention that the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b was satisfied when he sold his home in 2017. Although the evidence is \nnot conclusive, it constitutes a reasonable basis for the dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the \ndebt alleged in subparagraph 1.b, and I resolve it in his favor. \n       \n \nShortly after regaining full-time employment in February 2016, Applicant retained a \ndebt consolidation company to help him identify and pay his delinquencies. The company \nneither complied with their agreement, nor returned Applicant\u2019s deposit, prompting him to \nterminate their agreement in 2017. Since then, he has contacted creditors and satisfied the \ndebts in subparagraphs 1.k and 1.m as duplicated in 1.n. He has been making payments \ntowards the satisfaction of subparagraph 1.g since February 2019. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. I \nresolve subparagraphs 1.g, 1.k, and 1.m, as duplicated in 1.n, in his favor. \n \n \nThe debt alleged in subparagraph 1.h, totaling $3,174, was charged off and reported \nto the IRS. As such, it generates no ongoing vulnerability to coercion. I resolve \nsubparagraph 1.h in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant does not dispute the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.i, he \ncontends that the amount alleged delinquent is wrong, has retained an attorney, and is \nactively litigating the dispute. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.i, and resolve it in his favor.  \n \n\n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s contention that he owes approximately $10,000 less than the amount \nalleged in subparagraph 1.l ($15,082) is unsupported by documentary evidence. Similarly, \nhis contention that he is no longer responsible to complete debt satisfaction because the \ngovernment suspended the debt because of deceptive lending practices, is unsupported by \ndocumentary record evidence. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to subparagraph 1.l, and I \nconclude that it remains outstanding. \n \n \nApplicant satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.o. I resolve this allegation in \nhis favor. \n \n \n Although Applicant has entered payment plans to resolve the remainder of the \nconsumer debts alleged in the SOR, no payments were scheduled to begin until a month \nafter the hearing. Given the amount of this debt, it is too soon to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation is under control.  AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2015 and 2016 federal income tax returns and his income tax \nreturns for State 2. I resolve subparagraphs 1.p and 1.q in his favor. Subparagraph 1.r \nalleges that Applicant failed to file 2016 income tax returns for State 2 and State 3. \nApplicant had no duty to file a tax return for State 2 because he did not live or work there \nthat year. Applicant prepared his 2016 State 3 tax return, but did not file it because the \nreturn indicates that he owes $3,178, an amount he disputes. He provided no documentary \nevidence establishing that he filed a formal dispute with the state taxing authority. \nCurrently, it continues to remain unfiled. I conclude that Applicant owes the delinquency, as \nalleged in subparagraph 1.s, and that it remains outstanding. Under these circumstances, \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is only partially applicable. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Moreover, \u201cof special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative \nprocesses.\u201d (Id.) \n \n \nSeventeen to 20 traffic citations received over a seven-year period constitutes an \naverage of approximately two to three traffic citations per year. Although this is not an \nexcessive number of traffic citations, it is the circumstances surrounding the receipt of \nthese citations rather than their frequency which generates a security concern. Specifically, \nApplicant testified that several of these tickets were for driving a vehicle that he did not \nregister with the state motor vehicle authority because he could not afford the fee, and that \nrather than keeping it off the road, he periodically drove it when his registered vehicle was \nbroken down, prioritizing his daily job attendance over the legal responsibility to register the \nvehicle. Under these circumstances AG \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not \nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information, supports a \n\n10 \n \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information,\u201d \napplies to subparagraph 2.a. \n \n \nThe personal conduct adjudicative guideline also addresses deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. (AG \u00b6 16(a)) Applicant failed to \ndisclose to State 1\u2019s unemployment security compensation authority part-time income that \nhe was earning while receiving unemployment compensation, leading to the criminal \ncharge of misrepresentation to obtain unemployment benefits.  \n \n \nApplicant testified during direct examination that he did not disclose his part-time \nemployment income because he thought it was minimal, like his pension, which was not \nrequired to be reported. On cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that his part-\ntime income was much more than his monthly pension payments. Given this contradictory \ntestimony, I conclude Applicant\u2019s explanation for not reporting the part-time income to the \nunemployment compensation authority was not credible. I conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) applies \nwithout mitigation. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant deserves credit for disclosing this episode on his security \nclearance application, his subsequent, unbelievable explanation at the hearing renders the \napplication of any of the mitigating conditions inapplicable. I conclude that Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s decisions to drive an unregistered vehicle, rather than pay for its \nrenewal, and his failure to disclose part-time income while receiving unemployment \nbenefits epitomize the type of conduct that individuals may engage in if financially \ndistressed. Moreover, any presence of rehabilitation is overshadowed by the unresolved \ntax debt and the fact that most of the payment plans were not scheduled to begin until after \nthe close of the record. These concerns, combined with the intentional omission of relevant \nfinancial information to the state unemployment compensation authority, compel me to \nconclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest at this time to grant \nApplicant a security clearance. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n11 \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1-k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m \u2013 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 61-year-old interim team lead who has performed the same type of work with the same entity for about a year. He currently earns just over $100,000 a year. Born and raised in the United States, Applicant has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in statistics. Married in 2007, Applicant and his wife have three children, including one stepchild. He is committed to his spouse, who he describes as \u201cway too cute\u201d to divorce. (Tr. 9) His wife teaches on an hourly basis at a Russian language and studies program. Applicant lives within his means, owns an unencumbered $250,000 rental property yielding a monthly profit of about $900, and maintains both a retirement and an investment account. He does not \u201chave to dip into\u201d either of those accounts. (Tr. 26-27) He has a mortgage balance of about $244,000 on a property with a market value in excess of $600,000. He pays a monthly mortgage payment on that home of $2,000. One of his two cars has a modest monthly payment due, a payment of $300 toward its purchase plan.

Clearance is denied.  \n \n                                        Statement of the Case \n \nOn September 6, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudication Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on or after June 8, 2017. In a response notarized on September 29, 2018, \nApplicant addressed all allegations and requested a hearing before a Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was assigned the case on \nJanuary 16, 2019.  \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nOn March 15, 2019, a notice setting the hearing for April 4, 2019, was issued. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered two exhibits (Exs.), \naccepted as Exs. 1-2 and three hearing exhibits (HE) accepted as HE 1-3. Applicant \npresented a package of seven documents, accepted without objection as Exs. A-G, \ngave testimony, and introduced one witness.  \n \nThe parties were granted through April 16, 2019, to submit any additional \nmaterials. The government offered what has since been accepted as HE 4 on April 4, \n2019. Applicant forwarded what has since been accepted into the record without \nobjection as Exs. H-P on April 16, 2019. In the interim, the transcript of the proceeding \nwas received on April 15, 2019. The record was then closed. The record was reopened \non April 24, 2019, to accept a bound and expanded version of Exs. H-P premarked as \nitems PHE1-PHE16 and the record was again closed. Based on the testimony, \nmaterials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns. \n \n  Procedural Rulings  \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to Ukraine and Russia, identified as HE 3 and HE 4. The documents \nprovide elaboration and context for the summaries. I take administrative notice of the \nfacts as they relate to Ukraine and Russia included in the U.S. Government reports. \nThey are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute.  \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old interim team lead who has performed the same type of \nwork with the same entity for about a year. He currently earns just over $100,000 a \nyear. Born and raised in the United States, Applicant has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nstatistics. Married in 2007, Applicant and his wife have three children, including one \nstepchild. He is committed to his spouse, who he describes as \u201cway too cute\u201d to divorce. \n(Tr. 9) His wife teaches on an hourly basis at a Russian language and studies program.  \n \nApplicant lives within his means, owns an unencumbered $250,000 rental \nproperty yielding a monthly profit of about $900, and maintains both a retirement and an \ninvestment account. He does not \u201chave to dip into\u201d either of those accounts. (Tr. 26-27) \nHe has a mortgage balance of about $244,000 on a property with a market value in \nexcess of $600,000. He pays a monthly mortgage payment on that home of $2,000. \nOne of his two cars has a modest monthly payment due, a payment of $300 toward its \npurchase plan. He and his family are settled in their neighborhood. Applicant has not \nreceived credit counseling. (Tr. 38) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has a future interest in an apartment in Ukraine owned by her \n63-year-old mother. The apartment is expected to pass in equal halves to both \nApplicant\u2019s wife and her brother. It is believed the total value of the property is about \n$25,000-$30,000, making Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s share worth about $12,500-$15,000 before \ntaxes or fees. (PHE 14) While Applicant has not been to Ukraine since his 2007 \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nmarriage, his wife and children spent about two months there in the summer of 2018. \nThe wife regularly spends about two months in Ukraine each summer. (Tr. 44) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Ukraine. She is a retired \nfactory worker. She has not served in the Ukrainian or Russian military or government. \nApplicant\u2019s wife sends money to her mother. Applicant does not know the exact extent \nof his wife\u2019s current largess in terms of her payments to her mother. (Tr. 39) Before his \nwife started working and earning her own income, however, Applicant would send his \nmother-in-law about $200 a month. (Tr. 39) This mother-in-law recently spent \napproximately five months in the United States with Applicant and his wife. Otherwise, \nApplicant has periodic exchanges with her when she Skypes or phones with Applicant\u2019s \nwife, exchanges that take place weekly.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 46-year-old brother-in-law has not visited the United States. Although \nhe is believed to still be a citizen of Ukraine, he has spent the last decade residing in \nRussia. (Tr. 40) His contact with Applicant is minimal, limited to birthday calls. Neither \nspeaks the other\u2019s language. (Tr. 41) Applicant\u2019s wife speaks with her brother \u201cno more \nthan\u201d once a month. (Tr. 41) This sibling has never worked for the Ukrainian or Russian \ngovernment. (Tr. 48) He is a salesman for a private firm.  \n \nThe father of Applicant\u2019s eldest child, who lives with Applicant and his wife in the \nUnited States, lives in Ukraine. This teen has occasional contact with her biological \nfather when she is in Ukraine. The ex-spouse\u2019s obligation to pay child support was \nwaived in exchange for letting the girl move to the U.S. after Applicant and his wife wed.  \n \nFor tax years (TY) 2013-2017, Applicant failed to timely file Federal and state \nincome tax returns. This failure was the result of \u201cpure procrastination.\u201d (Tr. 30) \nApplicant was aware the returns had to be filed by mid-April of each year or a request \nfor an extension had to be submitted, but his focus was elsewhere. Although he does \nnot have a \u201cspecific record,\u201d such tax return filing failures are not new; he volunteered \nthat earlier TY return omissions \u201cprobably occurred.\u201d (Tr. 37) When later asked whether \nhe was testifying that he had not timely filed returns for TY 2007-2012, Applicant stated: \n\u201cI\u2019m testifying that the timely filing of taxes was inconsistent for all that. . . . There may \nhave been on-time filings. I couldn\u2019t tell you whether there were or not.\u201d (Tr. 38)  \n \nEvidence was offered showing that the following delinquent TY returns were \nprepared, although only the Federal return for TY 2016 is signed by Applicant. (Ex. B) \nThe copy of Applicant\u2019s complete Federal TY 2017 tax return is unsigned. (Ex. C) A \n2018 bill for Federal taxes due for TY 2014 for $1,235.19 was presented along with a \ncopy of Applicant\u2019s un-transacted check in that amount. (Ex. D) \n \nThe evidence presented after the hearing are copies of a tax preparer\u2019s forms \ndesigned for electronic transmittal. No direct documentary evidence was provided \nshowing that they were filed. The only evidence of taxes paid were copies of checks for \nTY 2017 state taxes owed and an April 2019 check paying his Federal obligation from \n2017 (see Exs. H-P). In sum, the evidence submitted here shows: \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nTY 2013 \u2013 Federal return prepared in 2017 with $841 refund; state filing \npresented, reflecting $340 refund; \n \n TY 2014 \u2013 Federal return prepared in 2018; state filing presented, reflecting \n$114 refund. \n \nTY 2015 \u2013 Federal return prepared in April 2019 showing $2,679 owed; state \nfiling presented, reflecting $367 owed; \n \nTY 2016 \u2013 Federal return prepared in April 2019; state filing presented, reflecting \nrefund of $1,175; \n \nTY 2017 \u2013 Federal return prepared in April 2019 with payment of $1,763; state \nfiling presented, reflecting $752 owed.   \n \n  Notice  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Ukraine, formerly part of the \nlater dismantled Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR), is a republic with a semi-\npresidential political system. In 2014, the Ukrainian parliament approved a new \ngovernment, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula. \nAdditional unrest occurred in 2014, involving thousands of pro-Russian protesters in \neastern and southern Ukraine. In 2015, a ceasefire agreement established a de facto \ndividing line between Ukrainian government-controlled and separatist-held areas in \nUkraine. (GX 5.) Relations between the countries are strained. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence and transcending \nnormal duty hours. The granting of access to classified information involves a high \ndegree of trust and confidence. Decisions include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nare in terms of the national interest and do not question the applicant\u2019s loyalty.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGUIDELINE F \u2013 Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nfailed to timely file Federal and state tax returns and to pay taxes owed for multiple \nyears. The issues related to the last of the tax years at issue were not settled until \nslightly less than a year ago (April 2019). Such facts are sufficient to invoke financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAs previously noted, the last of the tax years at issue were not settled until April \n2019, slightly less than a year ago. Multiple years of neglect are cited with regard to \nfailures to timely file Federal and state tax returns. Applicant freely volunteered that the \ntax years at issue in the SOR may only account for some of the tax years where his \n\u201cpure procrastination\u201d resulted in his failure to file Federal and state tax returns. There is \nno evidence of credit, financial, or tax counseling, although it appears he has used a \ncommercial tax preparation service at times in the past.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony fails to reflect a full appreciation of the legal requirement of \nfiling taxes in a timely manner, despite acknowledging he has long known of the mid-\nApril filing deadline for such filings. Attempts to rectify his tax filing situation at both the \nFederal and state levels were described, and some evidence that such tax filings were \nprepared and some payments were made was presented. Most of his documentation, \nhowever, is unsigned, is unsupported by a transcript or receipt that the filing was \ncompleted, or other substantiating item. Given these facts, AG \u00b6 20(a)-(d) do not apply. \n \nGUIDELINE B - Foreign Influence  \n \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n  \nAG \u00b6 7 (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7 (f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \n \nApplicant has a mother-in-law and a brother-in-law who are citizens of Ukraine \nresiding in Ukraine and Russia, respectively. Applicant\u2019s wife regularly sends money to \nher retired mother, a former private-sector factory worker. At her death, it is expected \nthat Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law will leave her apartment in Ukraine to her daughter and \nson in 50%-50% shares. The property should net each sibling about $12,500-$15,000 \neach in inherited value before any inheritance or transfer fees are deducted. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7 (a)-(b). However, I noted that this future interest is \nminor compared to the home, family, and life Applicant\u2019s wife has in the United States. \nTherefore, I find AG \u00b6 7 (f) inapplicable (\u201csubstantial business, financial, or property \ninterests\u201d (emphasis added)).  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant\u2019s loyalties are clearly to the United States, where he was born and \nraised. He brought his bride to this country, where he dotes upon her, and has not \nhimself returned to Ukraine since their 2007 marriage. In the United States, he lives in a \nhome with his wife, their two children, and his teenage stepchild. In short, his life, family, \nand career are in this country. The same can be said of Applicant\u2019s spouse.  \n \nBoth Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and brother-in-law live low-profile lives. Their \ncareers have been in non-managerial roles in the private sector with no nexus to either \na foreign government, military, or faction. It is true that Applicant\u2019s wife helps support \nher mother financially, with past support having been established as being under $2,500 \na year. In turn, his spouse has the prospect of a future interest in Ukrainian property, \nalthough that interest appears to be worth no more than $15,000 before taxes or fees. \nThere is no evidence indicating Applicant or his wife find these sums attractive \nincentives or an inducement for any type of non-benign action. While Applicant\u2019s wife \nobviously cares for her mother and sibling, they do not appear to hold the same priority \nin the life of Applicant and his spouse as their children, home, and the life they have \nshared here for over a dozen years.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts and circumstances surrounding \nthis case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and B in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n  \nApplicant is a 61-year-old contractor earning just over $100,000 a year. He was \nraised in the United States, but married a woman from Ukraine in 2007 with whom he \nshares three children. While his wife has a mother and a sibling who are citizens of \nUkraine and living in Ukraine and Russia, these low profile individuals have worked in \nthe private sector and have no nexus to a foreign military or government.  \n \nA minor financial tether exists between mother and daughter. The daughter \nprovides her mother with financial assistance, last documented as $2,400 a year. In \nturn, the mother has an apartment worth $25,000-$30,000, a half interest in which is \nexpected to flow to Applicant\u2019s spouse when her mother passes on. These sums do not \nseem significant in light of the family\u2019s income or resources, nor do the sums sent \nabroad appear to be more than supplemental income. In short, Applicant and his wife \nare more deeply tethered to the United States and their family here than to any foreign \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nkin or country. Given the ultimate disposition in this matter, I find foreign influence \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \n \nMost worrisome is Applicant\u2019s somewhat cavalier attitude regarding his failure to \nmeet his tax responsibilities and obligations. Given his blunt admission that it was \u201cpure \nprocrastination\u201d that led him to be late in his Federal and state tax return filings over the \nyears at issue, and his insouciant revelation that such lapses may also have occurred in \nearlier years, we appear to have a situation where \u201clack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d (see AG \u00b6 18) Inasmuch as \nthe last three years at issue were not fully addressed until less than a year ago, more \ntime is needed for Applicant to demonstrate that he can meet his tax obligations in a \ntimely and appropriate manner and reestablish his reputation for reliability and \ntrustworthiness. I find Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d:     \n \nFor Applicant \n    \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017. On \nFebruary 22, 2019, Applicant admitted both allegations raised and requested a hearing \nbefore a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. I was \nassigned the case on June 4, 2019.  \nA notice of hearing was issued on July 11, 2019, setting the hearing for August \n14, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled, during which time the Government \noffered two exhibits (Exs.), noted as Exs. 1-2. Applicant testified gave testimony and \noffered four documents, accepted without objection as Exs. A-D. He was given until \nSeptember 20, 2019, to submit any additional materials.

On September 20, 2019, a package of documents \nwas submitted by Applicant and accepted into the record without objection as Ex. E. \nThe record was then closed. Based on the testimony, materials, and record as a whole, \nI find Applicant mitigated security concerns. [Suggested re-draft] \n \n     Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old logistics analyst who has worked in that capacity for 23 \nyears. He completed high school. He was honorably discharged from the United States \nmilitary after 22 years, he retiringed  at the rank of master sergeant. He lives well within \nhis means. [Otherwise sounds like he spent 22 yrs at that rank] \n \nFor tax years (TY) 2012 and 2014-2015, Applicant failed to timely file, as \nrequired, his state and Federal income tax returns. He also failed to timely file, as \nrequired, state income tax returns for those same tax years. Usually, he used a popular \ntax preparation software to file his tax returns. (Tr. 24, 31) In preparation for filing his TY \n2012 returns, he got frustrated downloading updates to the software \u201cbecause [his] \ncomputer was too old.\u201d (Tr. 24) He replaced his computer, but still had problems \nupdating the program. Increasingly frustrated, he gave up, feeling confident that at least \nhe owed no taxes for TY 2012. (Tr. 25)  \n \nAt the time, Applicant did not know it was against the law to not file tax returns. \n(Tr. 26) He said, \u201cfrom the past, I\u2019ve always received a refund. So I thought that would \nstill be in the same category as getting a return [sic], for state and federal.\u201d (Tr. 26) He \nfelt monies owed to him as refunds were being held for him with the tax authorities and \nhe could \u201cstockpile\u201d them for later deposit into his savings or 401k accounts. (Tr. 25)  \n \nThe following year, in early 2014, Applicant timely filed tax returns, both federal \nand state, for TY 2013. (Tr. 25-26, 35, 38; Ex. E) In Applicant\u2019s case, one cannot \ncomplete a state tax return without first finishing a federal return. He did not, however, \nfile his late TY 2012 tax returns at that time because he \u201cdidn\u2019t have all [his] \ndocumentation.\u201d (Tr. 25) He was working at home and managing physical conditions \nthat would ultimately warrant knee surgery later that year and a heart procedure in \n2015, issues that would distract him from taxes. (Tr. 35-37)  No tax returns were then \nfiled for TY 2014-2015. (Tr. 42-43) \n \nIn early 2017, Applicant timely completed his TY 2016 tax returns, a practice he \nnow continues to perform annually. (Tr. 43-44) While completing his security clearance \napplication (SCA) in 2017, Applicant admitted he had failed to file some tax returns. (Tr. \n28) In that year he had filed his He filed his TY 2014 and TY 2015 tax returns, years for \nwhich he was issued refunds. (Tr. 42) He forgot about the need to file his tax returns for \nTY 2012 during his health issues and over time later in 2017. (Tr. 42). Since that time, \nApplicant has used an accountant to prepare his tax returns. (Tr. 48) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nBy 2018, Applicant had retained the services of an accountant to handle his \ntaxes. (Tr. 48) Applicant\u2019s filed his TY 2012 tax returns were ultimately filed by in early \n2019. (Tr. 32-33, 45; Ex. B) No refund was issued because he had missed the deadline \nfor late filing, thus losing the approximately $4,000 he had been owed. He discovered \nhe had waited too long to file those TY 2012 tax returns in order to receive the \napproximately $4,000 in refunds he had been owed. (Tr. 28; Ex. B) His sister mentioned \na credit repair service that could help him get his finances in order and give him \u201cpeace \nof mind,.\u201d which he then contacted (Tr. 27, 49) It was always his intention to have all tax \nrequirements reviewed and completed appropriately, it just never seemed urgent to him \nsince refunds were always owed and he was unaware there were time limits for \nclaiming refunds. His credit and financial situation have been improved and With help, \nlater refunds were received from the taxing authorities and his financial situation \nrectified to the point that his credit score is now 792. (Tr. 30) Applicant has no \noutstanding taxes due to any taxing authority. (Tr. 29)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nnecessarily include consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this \nguideline is that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nfailed to file, as required, federal and state income tax returns for multiple years. This is \nsufficient to potentially invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the inability to do so;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \n[If you say \u201cpotentially\u201d you should address each AG and find what does and \ndoes not apply]  \n \nFour conditions could mitigate the finance related security concerns posed here:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n \n \n \n \n5\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s initial delay in filing for tax returns (for TY 2012) was many years ago \nand due, in part, to his ignorance. With only a high school education, he was unaware \nthat a tax filing was required regardless of whether one owed taxes or, as here, was due \na refund. He was not trying to evade paying his share of taxes; indeed, there is no \nevidence that he was experiencing any form of financial distress or was overextended. \nThis initial failure was later compounded when he simply forgot about the neglected tax \nyear.  \n \nNow aware that the administrative action of filing is required annually, Applicant \ntook remedial action, sought professional guidance, has since been timely with this \nfunction since 2013, and now relies on a professional to oversee his taxes and \naccounts. Federal and state tax returns have been filed for all tax years at issue. This \nhas been a beneficial learning experience for Applicant, one which will not be repeated \nand one for which he is truly contrite. Consequently, I find AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(c), and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) apply.   \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the her  \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those \nfactors. I am also mindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \ngrant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased on careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old logistics analyst with a high school education. He has \nworked in that capacity for 23 years. He was honorably discharged from the United \nStates military after 22 years, retiring at the rank of master sergeant.  \n \nWith limited education and sophistication, Applicant was unaware that he was \nlegally obligated to file federal and state tax returns annually, regardless of whether \nadditional taxes were owed. Frustrated with his tax preparation software, he noted that \nhe was due a refund and did not owe additional taxes, and chose to forego timely filing \nhis TY 2012 tax returns for the moment. This delay was ultimately protracted, and he \nfailed to timely file federal and state tax returns for TY 2014-2015, as well.   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nOnce apprised of his error, Applicant sought financial guidance and took \ncorrective action. He filed the TY 2014-2015previously neglected, but initially forgot \nabout those for FY 2012.  returns and,When the TY 2012 returns were filed, he \ndiscovered he had missed a deadline to recoup the approximately $4,000 tax refund he \nhad been owed. Consequently, he learned a costly lesson. He took the lesson to heart.  \ndue to the length of time that had passed, suffered the loss of a sizeable refund. He has \nsince retained a tax preparation specialist to annually file his returns on his behalf. \nApplicant now understands his legal obligations and assures that they are timely \nexecuted. Sufficient time has passed to reflect he has learned his lesson, and there has \nbeen sufficient evidence to show he is capable to meet his financial obligations. I find \nthat Applicant has mitigated financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Ammerman, Esq. \n \n05/12/2020 \nDecision \nKatauskas, Philip J., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on July 1, 2009, in which he \ndisclosed that he owed federal and state income taxes. He received a security clearance \nin August 2009. On September 9, 2016, his employer, a federal contractor, reported \nthrough the Joint Adjudication Processing System (JPAS) that it had received a notice of \na federal tax levy on Applicant\u2019s wages. His employer requested that he submit another \nsecurity clearance application, which he did on October 4, 2016. On August 17, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD \nCAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 6, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. He neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations, but \nstated that he demanded \u201cstrict proof.\u201d At the hearing, the parties agreed to treat his \nresponses as denials. (Tr. 12.) Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October \n12, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. On April 15, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for May 15, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. (The government exhibits \nwere marked as Items 1 through 8 but have been redesignated as GE 1 through 8.) \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) 1 through 16, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 3, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old senior business analyst employed by federal contractors \nsince July 2009. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in business in 1989. (Tr. 62.) He married \nin August 1996 and has an adult son. He was employed as an administrative coordinator \nfor a university from November 1992 to June 2009 and retired from that position.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a bachelor\u2019s degree in business administration. She \nworked for a real estate firm and a title company before being hired by a federal \ncontractor, for whom she worked for about 16 years. In January 2006, the federal \ncontractor started downsizing, and Applicant\u2019s spouse began working as an independent \nconsultant in human resources for various small business, working mostly from her home. \nApplicant was not involved in her consulting business. Her gross income while working \nindependently was ranged from about $60,000 to about $150,000. In November 2016, \nher primary client sold his business. She had no other clients, and she closed her \nconsulting business. She was unemployed until she found employment in the private \nsector in July 2018. (Tr. 15-19, 53-54.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that she had spent most of her working life as an \nemployee and was unfamiliar with the tax requirements for self-employed workers. Her \nincome fluctuated, and she consistently owed substantial federal and state income taxes \nfor each year, plus penalties for making inadequate payments of estimated taxes. She \nand Applicant twice refinanced the mortgage loan on their home to make monthly \npayments of taxes due. She started looking for tax help after the year she earned \n$150,000 and was confronted with a large tax liability and penalties. She did not hire an \naccountant or tax professional, but instead she relied on self-employed friends for tax \nadvice. Among other things, she was advised to ask Applicant to maximize his tax \nwithholding at the zero-exemption rate. (Tr. 37.) Applicant complied with her request. (Tr. \n64.) \n \nAt about the same time that Applicant\u2019s spouse began having tax problems, her \nfather had a heart attack and died suddenly. Her mother had a heart attack and moved in \n\n \n3 \n \nwith them, increasing their living expenses. Her three sisters encountered significant \nmedical problems, all of which kept her from giving full attention to her tax problems.  \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse kept their professional lives separate. His spouse \ntestified that he is \u201cextremely private\u201d about his job. She does not know what he does, \ndoes not know his work telephone number, and has never contacted him at work. (Tr. \n48.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that when Applicant asked about her tax problems, she \ntold him that she was working on them and had contacted tax professionals for \nassistance. In June 2009, Applicant\u2019s wife sought help from a tax negotiation and \nmediation service that she had learned about from an infomercial. (AE 6 at 2; Tr. 33.) She \nworked with this service until it \u201csort of dropped the ball,\u201d and she then sought out a \nprofessional tax service. (Tr. 20-23, 58-59.) Applicant did not deal with either of these \nservices directly, but relied on his spouse to keep him informed. (Tr. 66.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse managed the house finances until 2017. Applicant was not \naware of the extent of their financial problems until he started gathering documents for a \npossible bankruptcy petition. When he reviewed his credit report, he first learned about \nthe amounts of the federal and state tax liens as well as other delinquent debts that he \ndid not recognize, and he decided that they needed to talk to a lawyer. (Tr. 68-69.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s state of residence obtained tax liens against Applicant and his spouse \nfor $2,707 in December 2007; $5,294 in November 2010; $11,463 in October 2011; \n$13,126 in December 2012; $2,016 in August 2014; $7,208 in January 2015; $14,334 in \nApril 2015; $9,809 in July 2015; $8,878 in December 2017. (GE 7.) The state tax liens \nare alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \nThe IRS obtained tax liens against Applicant and his spouse for $93,749 in \nDecember 2013, another tax lien for $45,406 in May 2015, and a tax lien for $39,508 in \nAugust 2016. (GE 6.) The tax levy in September 2016 was for a total of $208,835 for tax \nyears 2004, and tax years 2006 through 2012. (GE 2.) The federal tax debt is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a to be about $273,098. \n \nIn about 2014, Applicant and his wife hired a tax professional, who determined that \ntheir tax problems arose from the failure of Applicant\u2019s wife to make estimated quarterly \npayments. (Tr. 56; AE 5.)  \n \n \nFrom November 2016 to June 2017, Applicant and his spouse made $300 \nestimated tax payments to the IRS every month except May 2017. They made $250 \npayments to the state tax authority in January, February, March, and May 2018. In 2018, \nApplicant took over the family finances.  \n \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax debts, credit reports from \nFebruary 2018 and January 2017 (GE 4 and 5) reflected five delinquent debts: an \nautomobile loan for $46,089, past due for $760 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a mortgage loan for \n\n \n4 \n \n$544,000, past due for $3,271, with a balance of $359,424 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a credit-card \naccount charged off for $2,165 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and two medical bills referred for collection \nof $882 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $85 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \n \n \nOn September 6, 2018, Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetition, having completed the financial counseling required by the bankruptcy court. Their \npetition included all the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant reported monthly \ngross income of $9,166 and his spouse reported $1,122. Their joint disposable income \nwas calculated to be $3,026. They listed assets of $479,881 and liabilities of $542,118. \n(GE 8.) Their payment plan was confirmed in March 2019 and provided for monthly \npayments of $3,100 for 23 months followed by $3,605 for 27 months. The plan required \nthat Applicant and his wife surrender the automobile that was the collateral for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and pay the mortgage lender alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d directly outside \nthe plan.  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant and his spouse had paid $21,700 into the \npayment plan, of which $17,918 had been disbursed, and had made the first five monthly \npayments under the plan. (AE 12; AE 13; AE 15.) Applicant testified that the payments \non the mortgage loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d were current as of September 2018, when he \nfiled his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 97-98.) \n \n \nApplicant summarized his attitude about the bankruptcy by equating it to buying a \nnew car. He testified,  \n \nI want to do my 60 months, pay what I have to pay, pay when I have to pay, \ndo what the trustee tells me I need to do, follow [his lawyer\u2019s] instructions. \nAnd at the end of the 60 months I want a document that says, Mr. \n[Applicant], you\u2019ve satisfied everything that was required of you via the \nFederal Government, and you can go on with your life and don\u2019t do it again. \n \n(Tr. 93.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial manager has known him for about ten years. She regards him \nas a person of good moral character who operates with integrity, works hard and \u201cnever \nhas a bad word to say about anyone.\u201d She believes he is efficient, detail-oriented, and \nextremely competent. He is well organized, never misses a deadline, or forgets an \nassignment. (GE 14 at 1.) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s co-workers, who has known him for about three years, \nconsiders him intelligent, capable, and dedicated. He has observed that he is always \n\u201cquick on his feet,\u201d with sensible reactions in various situations requiring decisive action, \nand he demonstrates high morals and integrity in everything he does. (GE 14 at 2.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F. 3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n6 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe evidence presented by the parties at the hearing establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to . . . pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and \nnumerous, but they were incurred as a result of his spouse\u2019s ignorance about the tax laws \napplicable to self-employed taxpayers, which is not likely to recur. His spouse has learned \nthe consequences of her tax derelictions, she is no longer self-employed, and she is not \nlikely to return to self-employment in the foreseeable future. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by his \nspouse\u2019s failure to follow the tax laws for her business and her efforts to conceal the tax \nproblems from Applicant by repeatedly telling him that she was taking care of the problem. \nHis initial conduct was not responsible, because he failed to adequately determine why \nthey were repeatedly incurring high taxes and penalties while they were filing joint returns. \nHowever, once his pay was garnished and he realized the severity of the problem, he \ntook decisive action by contacting an attorney and filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition \nthat included the delinquent federal and state income taxes. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant received financial counseling as part of the \nbankruptcy process, and the problem is being resolved through the Chapter 13 payment \nplan. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. The degree to which a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan \nmakes an applicant\u2019s creditors whole is a factor that an administrative judge may consider \nwhen evaluating whether an applicant is acting reasonably to rectify his financial \ndifficulties. ISCR Case No. 15-00682 (App. Bd. Jul. 13, 2016). In this case, Applicant\u2019s \ncreditors, including the federal and state tax authorities, have agreed to the Chapter 13 \npayment plan and Applicant is complying with it.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established. Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 payment plan provides for \npaying the federal and state tax authorities, and Applicant is complying with the plan. \nAlthough Applicant had been making the monthly payments for only about five months at \nthe time of the hearing, he had paid $21,700 into the plan, resolved the past-due \npayments on the mortgage loan and automobile loan outside the plan, and he made it \nclear that he is determined to put his tax problems behind him. He knows that he needs \nto comply with the Chapter 13 plan in order to keep his clearance and his job. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has worked for federal contractors and held a security \nclearance since 2009. He is highly respected for his dedication, integrity, and hard work. \nHe was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \nPhilip J.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 21, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 7, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n\n \n2 \n \non July 2, 2019, scheduling the hearing for July 15, 2019. Applicant waived the 15-day- \nhearing-notice requirement set forth in E3.1.8 of the Directive. (Tr. at 6). \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. I appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I the Government\u2019s administrative notice request and accompanying \nsource documents for Somalia. I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 3, and 4 in \nevidence without objection. GE 2 consists of interrogatories in which the Government \ninquired of Applicant whether he adopted the enclosed reports of investigation (ROI) \nsummarizing two background interviews conducted by a DOD investigator on October 3 \nand December 18, 2017. Applicant indicated therein, and at the hearing, that he did not \nadopt the ROIs and therefore objected to them. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection, \nadmitted in evidence only pages 1-5 of GE 2, and did not admit in evidence the ROIs \ncontained in pages 6-16 of GE 2. (Tr. at 23-30) \n \n Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which I \nadmitted in evidence without objection. At Department Counsel\u2019s request, I left the \nrecord open until August 5, 2019, to allow both him and Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit a request for administrative notice on Morocco. By that date, I received \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice on Morocco and marked it and \nthe accompanying source documents as HE IV. I did not receive any additional \ndocumentation from Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 22, \n2019. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s requests that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Somalia and Morocco were included in the record as HE I and HE IV, as \nreferenced above. Applicant did not object. I have taken administrative notice of the \nfacts contained in HE I and HE IV, as summarized in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations except SOR \u00b6 3.a, which he denied. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my factual findings.   \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He is a Moroccan-born citizen who immigrated to the \nUnited States in 2006. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen and was issued a U.S. \npassport in June 2011. As of the date of the hearing, he was single and did not have \nany children. (Tr. at 40-45; GE 1, 3; AE E, H) \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in Morocco in 1997 and obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree there in 2002. He attended a community college in the United States \nfrom 2007 to 2012, but he did not earn a degree. In 2006, he received an offer to work \nas a linguist for a DOD contractor in Iraq, contingent on obtaining a security clearance. \nMeanwhile, he has worked primarily as a contract virtual linguist, but he was \n\n \n3 \n \nunemployed as of the date of the hearing. He has never held a DOD security clearance. \n(Tr. at 7-10, 13, 36-46, 53-58, 113-114, 121-122; GE 1, 2; AE F, G) \n   \nAll of Applicant\u2019s family live in Morocco. His mother, three brothers, and three \nsisters are citizens and residents of Morocco (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). His father passed away \nin approximately 2008. His mother is a 73-year-old housewife. His brothers are ages 52, \n39, and 33. His 52-year-old and 39-year-old brothers are self-employed carpenters, and \nhis 33-year-old brother works as a technician for a private company. His sisters are \nages 48, 46, and 35. His 48-year-old and 35-year-old sisters are housewives, and his \n46-year-old sister is an assistant at a private school. (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Other than his 48-\nyear-old sister, who is widowed, all of his siblings are married with children. He testified \nthat none of his sisters\u2019 spouses have affiliations with the Moroccan government or \nmilitary. (Tr. at 22, 58-72, 74-75, 78-79, 116-118; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nWhile Applicant indicated in his August 2017 security clearance application \n(SCA) that he communicated regularly with his brothers and sisters, he testified that his \nonly contact with family in Morocco was with his mother and 33-year-old brother. They, \nalong with his 33-year-old brother\u2019s wife and minor child, live together in an apartment \nApplicant purchased for his mother, as further discussed below. He speaks with his \nmother and 33-year-old brother almost daily, primarily through group chat on WhatsApp. \nHe traveled to Morocco to visit his family and friends in approximately 2008, 2011, \n2013, and for nearly three months in both 2016 and 2019. He testified that none of his \nfamily members in Morocco are aware that he is seeking a security clearance or that he \nhas received an offer to work as a linguist for a DOD contractor. (Tr. at 16-17, 50-53, \n58-72, 74-75, 91-93, 105, 112-114, 116-118, 125-126, 133-134; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nApplicant testified that he gave his mother money when he visited her in \nMorocco, and he also provided money to some family members so that they could visit \nher in Morocco when she was sick; however, he had not sent money to his mother in a \nlong time. He clarified that his disclosure in his SCA that he provided financial support of \n$6,000 annually to his mother (SOR \u00b6 1.h) occurred only once, in approximately 2016. \nHe testified that no family member in Morocco was relying on him for financial support \nas of the date of the hearing, as his siblings were financially independent. (Tr. at 58-72, \n115-116; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nApplicant also has five cousins who are citizens and residents of Morocco: two \nare police officers (SOR \u00b6 1.e), two serve in the Moroccan military, and one is retired \nfrom the Moroccan military (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He testified and disclosed in his 2018 \ncounterintelligence (CI) screening that his 56-year-old cousin retired from the Moroccan \nmilitary in approximately 2009, and his last contact with this cousin was during his 2016 \ntrip to Morocco; his 40-year-old and 34-year-old cousins began serving in the Moroccan \nmilitary in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and his last contact with these cousins was in \n2012 and 2002, respectively; and he was unaware of the ranks that all three cousins \nheld in the Moroccan military but indicated that they served in the infantry. He also \ntestified and disclosed in his CI screening that his 39-year-old and 34-year-old cousins \nwere police officers in Morocco since 2007 and 2008, respectively, and his last contact \nwith these cousins was in 2008 and 2002, respectively. (Tr. at 72-78, 118-119; GE 3) \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant has two childhood friends who are citizens and residents of Morocco, \none of whom is a police officer (SOR \u00b6 1.g). He testified that he had only occasional \ncontact with the childhood friend in Morocco who is a police officer, and he last saw this \nfriend during his 2019 trip to Morocco. He testified that he did not have any contact with \nhis other childhood friend. (Tr. at 16-17, 75-78, 119-120; GE 1, 2, 3) \n \nIn approximately 2008, Applicant opened a bank account in Morocco (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nHe testified that he did so to hold the money necessary for his land purchase, as \ndiscussed below. He estimated in his 2018 CI screening that the balance of this account \nwas approximately $9,000 USD. In late 2013, he purchased an apartment in Morocco \nfor $50,000 USD (SOR \u00b6 1.j). He purchased the apartment for his mother to live. He \nintends to sell the property when his mother passes away and transfer the profit to the \nUnited States. In 2016, he purchased land in Morocco for $30,000 USD (SOR \u00b61.k). He \ndid so as an investment, as he intends to build commercial property on the land and \nthen rent or sell it. He testified that his land purchase was not a reflection of any loyalty \nto Morocco. As of the date of the hearing, his 33-year-old brother was overseeing and \nmanaging the development of the land, which consisted of construction of a coffee shop \nwith an apartment on top. (Tr. at 16-17, 50-53, 58-72, 93-105, 109-112, 123-125; GE 1, \n3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s former girlfriend and ex-fianc\u00e9e is a citizen of Somalia, and she has \nchildren living in Somalia (SOR \u00b6 1.d). She is a 42-year-old permanent resident of the \nUnited States. He testified that she was never a citizen of Syria. He met her in \napproximately 2013 or 2014, when he worked for a refugee shelter in the United States \nin which she was a former resident, after she had fled Somalia at age ten to Saudi \nArabia and then Syria before receiving refugee status to come to the United States. She \nhas six children: three reside in the United States, two reside in Somalia, and one \nresides in Europe. He provided approximately $3,000 in financial support to her parents, \nwho are also citizens of Somalia (SOR \u00b6 1.i). He testified that his relationship with her \nwas on and off from approximately 2013 to 2017, as she became engaged to another \nindividual in late 2015, and then yet again another individual in approximately 2019. He \ntestified that he had no intentions of reuniting with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, and he last had \ncontact with her in approximately June 2019. He testified that he no longer had any ties \nto her, her parents, or any Somali citizen. (Tr. at 16-17, 20, 46-50, 79-91, 126-134, 152; \nGE 2, 3) \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant rented an apartment in the United States. \nHe has a checking account in the United States with a balance of approximately \n$30,000. He believed he has a retirement account in the United States related to a \nprevious employer, but he was unaware of its value. He also owns a car. He testified \nthat he has no intentions of returning to Morocco to live. He testified that he is loyal to \nthe United States. He received a charter membership certificate in 2012 for his \nparticipation and contribution to the National Language Service Corps. He was \npresented a team player award in 2014. He was awarded a certificate of appreciation in \n2015 in recognition for three years of service to a former employer. (Tr. at 46, 53-54, 66, \n105-106, 112, 120-123, 134-135; GE 1; AE B, C, D)  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nCRIMINAL \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in December 2015 and charged with: (1) assault and \nbattery (SOR \u00b6 2.a); (2) stalking with reasonable fear of death, assault, etc. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.b); (3) using profane or threating language by means of telephone, cell broadcast, or \ntext (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and (4) causing a telephone to ring, with or without intent to talk, with \nintent to annoy (SOR \u00b6 2.d). Applicant testified that his ex-fianc\u00e9e, as discussed \npreviously, reported him to the police in late 2015 after he questioned her upon \ndiscovering that she had gotten engaged to another individual. He pled guilty to the \nfourth charge and charges one through three were nolle prossed. He was sentenced to \n180 days in jail, suspended, fined $92, and ordered not have any contact with his ex-\nfianc\u00e9e and her family. She obtained a two-year protective order against him in April \n2016, which was dissolved by the court in May 2017 at her request. He does not have \nany other criminal-related incidents. (Tr. at 16-17, 54-56, 79-91, 106-109, 112, 114-115; \nGE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A) \n \nPERSONAL CONDUCT \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified his response to section 22 \nof his 2017 SCA, because he failed to list the assault and battery charge, as set forth in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, and the charge of causing a telephone to ring, with or without intent to talk, \nwith intent to annoy, as set forth in SOR \u00b6 2.d (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Section 22 instructed that he \nreport information regardless of whether the record in his case was sealed, expunged, \nor otherwise stricken from the court record, or the charge was dismissed. Section 22 \nalso inquired whether, in the seven years prior to completing his SCA, he had been \nissued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against \nhim; he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal or any other type of law \nenforcement official; he had been charged, convicted, or sentenced of a crime in any \ncourt; or he had been or was at the time of completing his SCA on probation or parole. It \nalso inquired whether he was at the time of completing his SCA on trial or awaiting a \ntrial on criminal charges.  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed, in response to section 22 of his 2017 SCA, his April 2016 \nconviction for \u201ccause telephone/pager to ring to annoy.\u201d In so disclosing, he stated that \nhe was in a relationship with his then girlfriend, the complainant, when she reported to \nthe police that he was bothering her. He stated that the court issued a two-year \nprotective order prohibiting him from having contact with his ex-girlfriend or her children. \nHe also stated that she dropped the protective order in May 2017, after which time they \nresumed their relationship. (GE 1, 2) \n \nMorocco \n \n \nThe United States considers Morocco an important regional security, trade, and \ndevelopment partner, and Morocco is a designated Major Non-NATO Ally. It is a \nmember of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat the Islamic State. In 2017, the United \nStates and Morocco launched an \u201cInitiative to Address Homegrown Violent Extremists\u201d \nunder the auspices of the multilateral Global Counterterrorism Forum.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIn April 2019, the U.S. Department of State raised the travel advisory for Morocco \nto \u201cLevel 2: Exercise Increased Caution,\u201d due to terrorism. Terrorist attacks targeting \ntourist sites, official Moroccan government facilities, and the U.S. Consulate and Public \nAffairs annex in Casablanca took place in Morocco in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2018. \nExtremists claiming allegiance to ISIS targeted and murdered two Scandinavian tourists \nin the 2018 attack. In addition, while Morocco is viewed as one of the more stable \ncountries in West Africa, protests reflecting grievances over the economy, governance, \npolice brutality, and high-level cronyism and corruption have surged in the historically \nmarginalized north and east since 2016. \n \nSomalia \n \nThe United States formally recognized the federal government of Somalia in \nJanuary 2013. In July 2018, the U.S. Department of State issued a level 4 travel \nadvisory for Somalia, advising U.S. citizens not to travel to Somalia due to terrorism, \ncrime, and piracy. It also assessed Mogadishu as being a critical threat location for \nterrorist activity directed at or affecting U.S. Government interests. Violent crime is \ncommon throughout Somalia and no area is considered immune from violence, as the \npotential exists for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against foreign nationals at \nany time throughout the country. The U.S. Government cannot provide consular \nservices to U.S. citizens in Somalia. \n \n \nIn March 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State designated Somali-based Al-Shabaab \nas a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The group remained active in Somalia throughout \n2017. In what is believed to be the single deadliest attack of the group\u2019s history in \nSomalia, Al-Shabaab detonated multiple bombs in Mogadishu in October 2017, killing \nmore than 500 people. Somalia\u2019s porous borders contribute to regional insecurity, as Al-\nShabaab and others continue to move throughout the region mostly undetected. With \nlittle law enforcement cooperation between the federal government of Somalia and \nSomali state governments, the ability of U.S. law enforcement to investigate suspected \nterrorists, terrorist incidents, and kidnappings is hampered. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process.  \n \nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \n\n \n7 \n \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n8 \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively \nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in \nhaving a family member living under a foreign government.  \n \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant credibly testified that he was no longer in \na relationship with and did not have any contact with his former girlfriend and ex-\nfianc\u00e9e who is a citizen of Somalia, or her parents who are citizens of Somalia, or any \nSomali citizen. He credibly testified that he had no intentions of reuniting with his ex-\nfianc\u00e9e. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i, and I find \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, six siblings, five cousins, and two childhood friends are \ncitizens and residents of Morocco. In April 2019, the U.S. Department of State raised \nthe travel advisory for Morocco to \u201cLevel 2: Exercise Increased Caution,\u201d due to \nterrorism. Applicant maintains daily contact with his mother and 33-year-old brother. He \ntraveled to Morocco in approximately 2008, 2011, 2013, 2016, and 2019, to visit his \nfamily and friends. He gave his mother $6,000 in approximately 2016, and he also \ngave her money when he visited her in Morocco five times between 2008 and 2019, as \ndiscussed above. In addition, Applicant\u2019s five cousins and one childhood friend are \naffiliated with either the Moroccan military or government, as previously discussed. Of \n\n \n9 \n \nthese individuals, Applicant most recently saw his eldest cousin, who is retired from the \nMoroccan military, during his 2016 trip to Morocco; he also saw his one childhood \nfriend, who is a police officer, during his 2019 trip to Morocco. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are \nestablished as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and 1.e-1.h. \n \nApplicant also has assets in Morocco totaling approximately $80,000. These \ninclude his bank account that he opened in approximately 2008, which had a balance of \napproximately $9,000 USD as of his 2018 CI screening; his apartment that he \npurchased for $50,000 USD in 2013 for his mother, and in which his mother, 33-year-\nold brother, and 33-year-old brother\u2019s family live; and his land that he purchased for \n$30,000 USD in 2016, which he intends to use as an investment property. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(f) is \nestablished as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.l. \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and  \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAs previously stated, Applicant maintains daily contact with his mother and 33-\nyear-old brother in Morocco and he visited them as recently as 2019. He saw his one \nchildhood friend who is a police officer in Morocco during his 2019 trip there, and he \nsaw his one cousin who is retired from the Moroccan military during his 2016 trip there. \nHe also has significant assets in Morocco totaling $80,000, to include the apartment in \nwhich his mother and 33-year-old brother live and the land that he purchased as \nrecently as 2016, which he was developing as a commercial property as of the date of \nthe hearing. In contrast, his assets in the United States total only $30,000, and they \nconsist primarily of a checking account and a car. Accordingly, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n8(b), 8(c) and 8(f) are not established as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.h., and 1.j-1.l. \n\n \n10 \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.\u201d Applicant was convicted in 2016 of causing a telephone to ring, with or \nwithout intent to talk, with intent to annoy. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal record consists solely of four charges from 2015 and his \nconviction in 2016 for one of those four charges, as previously discussed, stemming \nfrom his involvement with his former girlfriend and ex-fianc\u00e9e. He credibly testified that \nhe has no intentions of reuniting with this individual, and he does not have any other \ncriminal-related incidents. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nAG 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \n\n \n11 \n \nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nApplicant disclosed his 2016 conviction in response to section 22 of his 2017 \nSCA. In so doing, he also explained the circumstances surrounding it, which stemmed \nfrom the same incident with his former girlfriend and led to the four charges brought \nagainst him in 2015. Though he failed to disclose all of the underlying charges, and \nspecifically the charges in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.d as alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a, I find that he did \nnot deliberately omit them with the intent to falsify his SCA in light of the information he \ndid disclose. As such, AG 16(a) is not established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, J, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these \nguidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct and personal conduct security \nconcerns, but he has not mitigated the foreign influence security concerns involving his \nties to Morocco. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c, 1.e - 1.h, 1.j - 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.i: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.d: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on February 5, 2019, and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 4, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \n\n \n2 \n \n(NOH) on April 19, 2019, scheduling the hearing for June 6, 2019. I canceled that \nhearing on June 3, 2019, at Applicant\u2019s request, due to the unavailability of his personal \nrepresentative. DOHA issued a second NOH on June 6, 2019, rescheduling the hearing \nfor July 22, 2019. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 14 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant objected to GE 15, consisting of an unauthenticated Report of \nInvestigation summarizing two background interviews conducted by a DOD investigator \non March 14 and May 31, 2018. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection and did not admit GE \n15 in evidence. Applicant testified. He did not call any witnesses or submit any \ndocumentation. At Applicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until August 12, 2019, for \nadditional documentation. On August 8, 2019, I received documentation from Applicant \nthat I marked collectively as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A and admitted in evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 30, 2019.

His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. He is 29 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was engaged to \nbe married to his girlfriend of 11 years, who is the mother of their two minor children. \n(Answer; Tr. at 11-14, 47-48, 77, 91-97, 115, 124-125, 135-140, 144-146; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2008. He earned an associate\u2019s degree \nin 2016 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. As of the date of the hearing, he has worked \nas an information technology help desk analyst for his current employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since November 2017. He also worked as a part-time children\u2019s football \nofficial since 2008. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at 9-10, 15, 47, 89-91, \n96-97, 135-138; GE 1; AE A) \n \n \nIn approximately May 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI) of alcohol or drugs, first offense, and purchase or possession \nof alcohol. He was 18 years old. This was his first criminal-related offense. He was \ndriving a friend to 7-11 when the police pulled him over for a broken tail light. He \ntestified that he had previously been at a party where he had taken a sip of a drink \nthinking it was juice, but when he realized it contained alcohol he \u201ctried to quickly spit it \nout.\u201d His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .002%. The charges were nolle prossed. He \ntestified that his attorney told him and his father that they did not have to worry as the \ncase was closed. (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-106; GE 1-4) \n \n \nIn approximately May 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old, the charge of DUI \nof alcohol or drugs, as set forth above, was reinstated, to his surprise. He was \nrepresented by an attorney, and this case was consolidated with his December 2010 \ncharge of marijuana possession (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.b), as discussed below. Applicant \ntestified that his attorney advised him to plead guilty, because he could not afford to \nfight the charge and he did not want to delay his efforts at the time to enlist in the U.S. \n\n \n3 \n \nmilitary. He pled guilty to DUI of alcohol or drugs in February 2011, and was sentenced \nto 60 days in jail, suspended, fined $500, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 12 \nmonths. (SOR \u00b6 1.a; Tr. at 48-52, 56-57, 97-110; GE 1-4) \n \n \nIn approximately December 2010, at age 20, Applicant was charged with \nmarijuana possession. He testified that at his sister\u2019s request, he drove to a fast food \nrestaurant to buy her food, using her car as he did not own a car at the time, when he \nwas pulled over by the police for failure to yield. The police officer found an empty bag \nin the car and claimed it was an \u201cempty marijuana pack.\u201d Applicant testified that though \nhe was aware that his sister smoked marijuana on occasion, he was unaware that she \nhad any marijuana-related paraphernalia in the car. He was given a ticket to show up to \ncourt. He was represented by an attorney, and this case was consolidated with his May \n2010 charge of DUI alcohol or drugs (SOR \u00b6 1.a), as set forth above. He testified that \nhis attorney told him he was just getting a ticket. In February 2011, he also pled guilty to \nthe amended charged of paraphernalia possession. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail \nwith 85 days suspended, placed on unsupervised probation for 3 years, and fined $416. \nHe spent about a weekend in jail. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.b; Tr. at 52-60, 103-110; GE 1, 5) \n \n \nIn approximately May 2011, at age 20, Applicant was charged with marijuana \npossession, driving with a suspended or revoked license, and driving with a defective \nbrake light, all of which occurred on a military base. He testified that he was pulled over \non the base in which he worked while smoking a Black & Mild cigar. He testified that the \ncigar did not contain marijuana, and he believed the police pulled him over because of \nracial profiling, as he is an African American man. He testified that the car he was \ndriving was a relative\u2019s car, as he still did not own a car at the time, and the police found \nmarijuana in the car. Applicant denied that the marijuana belonged to him and testified \nthat he was unaware of any marijuana present in the car. He was given a ticket to show \nup to court. He was represented by a court-appointed attorney. He testified that he \nunderwent random pre-trial drug testing for five to six months, and approximated that he \nwas drug tested five to ten times during this period. He pled guilty in a federal district \ncourt to the infraction of driving without a valid operator\u2019s license and was fined $100; \nthe remaining charges were dismissed. (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Tr. at 58-63, 110-116; GE 6-7) \n \n \nApplicant attributed his criminal involvement from 2009 to 2011 to not fulfilling his \nfather\u2019s expectations after he graduated from high school. He described his father, who \nis honorably retired from the U.S. military, as an \u201caccomplished\u201d man, and he felt like he \nwas a disappointment. He \u201cgot depressed.\u201d He testified that he was young, he made \nmistakes trying to find himself, and he associated with the wrong crowd. (Tr. at 46-48, \n77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A)  \n \n \nIn approximately December 2014, at age 24, Applicant was charged with stealing \nfrom a military exchange an iPhone USB charging cable and a pair of gloves, with an \naggregate value of less than $1,000, and assaulting an employee of the exchange. He \nwas at the commissary visiting his mother, who worked there. He testified that he was \nhurriedly shopping, without a cart and while on his phone, when he accidentally walked \nout of the exchange with a $10 cellular phone charger before paying for it, as he was \nrushing to get home to his pregnant fianc\u00e9e. When he then attempted to pay for the \n\n \n4 \n \ncharger, he was not permitted to do so. He denied assaulting any employee of the \nexchange. He was handcuffed and then released and given a ticket to show up to court. \nHe testified that he consulted with a private attorney, but elected to accept a court-\nappointed attorney instead. In March 2015, he pled guilty in a federal district court to \ntheft of government property and was sentenced to six months of supervised probation \nand fined $150. He testified that he chose to plead guilty because \u201cthere really wasn\u2019t \nnothing I could really do to get around it.\u201d He continued, \u201cI just wanted to move forward. \nI accepted it.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.d; Tr. at 42, 63-67, 115-124; GE 1, 8-9) \n \n \nIn approximately August 2015, at age 24, Applicant was charged with felony \npossession with intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana, felony transporting five+ \npounds of marijuana, and resisting arrest. As of the date of the hearing, this was his last \ncriminal offense. He stated the following in his 2017 security clearance application \n(SCA): \n \nAn unknown package arrived at my parents[\u2019] home. I wrote [\u201c]wrong \naddress[\u201d] on the package without opening the package. At this point I am \ncompletely unaware of what the package contained. I put the package in \nmy car with intentions to return it to the post office. I am unaware that \nthere were unmarked police cars parked around my neighborhood \nwatching me. By the time I drove to the end of my street, I was pulled over \nby several police officers. I was taken to the police station and was \ninformed the package contained marijuana. I cooperated with the police \nhoping to find [anyone] who could have used my address without my \nknowledge or consent. I was the one who suffered being charged for this \noffense I had no intentions of committing. \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135, 140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant reiterated the same narrative at hearing. He testified that this incident \noccurred in April 2015. At the the time, he, his fianc\u00e9e, and his children lived with his \nparents in their home. He testified that when the police took him to his parents\u2019 home, \nwhere he was observed to have received the package and after they stopped him as he \nwas en route to the post office, they entered the home aggressively to search it. He \ntestified that the police assumed he would be resistant because of his size, and things \ngot \u201ccrazy\u201d because everyone in the home at the time, to include his mother and \nfianc\u00e9e, demanded that the police show them their search warrant. He testified that the \npolice did not find anything in the home. He stated in his SCA and testified that the \nfederal authorities told him they did not believe he was involved with the marijuana \npackage and did not pursue criminal charges against him, but county authorities were \nlooking for a conviction and he fit the bill. He testified that the county had a conviction \nrate of approximately 97%, and he believed his ethnicity factored into their pursuit of \ncriminal charges against him, which did not occur until approximately six months after \nthe incident, in August 2015; Applicant\u2019s father echoed the same sentiment in the \nreference letter he wrote for Applicant. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-78, 124-135, \n140-141; GE 1, 10-11; AE A) \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant was represented by an attorney. He pled guilty to possession with \nintent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana. He testified that he did so because he was \nscared and he did not believe he had another choice, as his attorney told him that he \nwas facing five to ten years in jail, his attorney\u2019s fees were $25,000, and he had to think \nabout his young family. He testified that his attorney advised him to plead guilty \nbecause \u201cit\u2019s about the jury and the area you\u2019re living in and the county of how you look, \nyou fit the profile.\u201d He testified that his attorney told him that \u201cif you plead guilty, you can \nstart fresh and you can start your life over.\u201d He also testified that he believed he was \npleading guilty to a misdemeanor, because he was told such by his attorney. The \ncharge of \u201cresisting arrest\u201d was dropped because he was compliant. He was sentenced \nto 10 years in jail, with 9 years and 1 month suspended, his driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended for six months, and he was fined $628; the remaining charges were nolle \nprossed.

He was then \nplaced on work release and required to report in person to his probation officer once \nmonthly. After several months, his in-person probation requirement was switched to \nonce every three months; it was then lifted and he was required to simply call into his \nprobation officer once monthly. He testified that he was drug tested during the period in \nwhich he was on probation, initially once every three months and then randomly. He \ncompleted probation in August 2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.b; Tr. at 38-46, 67-87, 124-135, \n140-141; GE 1, 10-11) \n  \n \nIn approximately March 2017, at age 26, Applicant was found by a federal district \ncourt to have violated his federal probation from his March 2015 conviction for theft of \ngovernment property (SOR \u00b6 1.d), as a result of his August 2015 felony charges, as \ndiscussed above (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 2.b). His federal probation was revoked and he was \nsentenced to 15 days in jail, with credit for time served. He served this time in \nconjunction with the 10 months that he served from 2016 to 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Tr. at 78-\n79, 134-135, 140-141; GE 12-14) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was unaware at the time that his guilty pleas to the \ncharges in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e equated to admissions of guilt. He testified that he was \nalso unaware that he was developing a criminal record as a result of his guilty pleas. He \ntestified that he only began to understand the meaning of his guilty pleas when he \nstarted the security clearance process in approximately 2017. He testified that had he \ntruly understood, he would have taken a \u201cdifferent approach\u201d and he \u201cwould have fought \nfor more than just always pleading, pleading, pleading.\u201d (Tr. at 108-110, 144-146) \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana at least two to three times in approximately April 2014. \nHe testified that this was the first time he used marijuana, and he experimented with it \nsocially with friends. He stated in his SCA that he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture because he has two children to support, he planned on marrying, and he \nintended to continue his career in information technology. He denied using marijuana \nafter April 2014, and denied using it in April 2017. He testified that he could not have \nused marijuana in 2017 because he was being drug tested as part of his probation for \nhis felony conviction (SOR \u00b6 1.e), as discussed above. He testified that he had not been \n\n \n6 \n \ndrug tested since he completed probation in August 2018, and he had not yet been drug \ntested by his current employer as of the date of the hearing. He testified that he no \nlonger socialized with the individuals with whom he used marijuana in 2014. He testified \nthat if he were ever to find himself in a situation where illegal drugs were being used, or \nlegal drugs were being misused, he would leave. (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Tr. at 79-89, 93-94, 107-\n108, 141-142; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was a \u201cdifferent person.\u201d He acknowledged the \nmistakes he made in his past, but stressed that \u201cI wake up and do everything differently. \nI got kids that look up to me.\u201d He stated that he took \u201cfull responsibility and \naccountability [for] each of these situations and encounters I have ever had with the law \nenforcement.\u201d Since he began working for his employer in November 2017, he has \nreceived two pay increases and earned $40,000 annually as of the date of the hearing. \nHe testified that he has not had any unfavorable issues at work and his employer was \naware of his criminal history. He was rated favorably in his 2018 performance review. \nHe earned a grade point average of 3.8 with his bachelor\u2019s degree. He moved out of his \nparents\u2019 home in 2018 and has since rented a home for himself, his fianc\u00e9e, and their \nchildren. He testified that he is a family man, and he spends time with them during his \nfree time. (Tr. at 77, 91-97, 115, 135-140, 144-146; AE A) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father described him as a \u201cgood man who has gone through the many \nchallenges that many of America\u2019s young black men [go] through . . . .\u201d Having held a \nsecurity clearance and worked as a security manager during his military career, his \nfather stated that Applicant\u2019s character was evidenced by the trust he has earned from \nthe various individuals who provided references on his behalf. His coworker of two \nyears attested to his work ethic, professionalism, timeliness, and positivity. His former \nhigh-school basketball coach described him as a dedicated family man of strong moral \ncharacter. Several other individuals who have known Applicant for a number of years, to \ninclude one who has known him since 1998 and another who has been a fellow referee \nsince 2014, reiterated that Applicant possessed the character and trustworthiness to \nhold a security clearance. (AE A). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n\n \n7 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.\u201d  \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred over a span of six years, from 2009 to \n2015. He has four convictions: two in 2011, for DUI of alcohol or drugs and for \nparaphernalia possession; in 2015 for theft of government property; and in 2016 for \n\n \n8 \n \nfelony possession with intent to distribute five+ pounds of marijuana. He was also found \nin 2017 to have violated his federal probation. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established.  \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following mitigating conditions:   \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced into committing \nthe conduct underlying his criminal convictions. To the contrary, his guilty pleas and his \nadmissions in his Answer constitute evidence that he engaged in the conduct that led to \nhis criminal convictions. His assertions that he did not truly understand the nature of his \nguilty pleas at the time of his offenses, and he was convinced by the various attorneys \nthat represented him to take such pleas due to factors such as racial bias, cannot \nsubstitute or negate the record evidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) are not established. \nI commend Applicant\u2019s involvement with his community as a children\u2019s football \nofficial since 2008, his attainment of his associate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2016 and \n2018, and his favorable employment record with his current employer since 2017. \nHowever, his criminal conduct spanned a period of six years and he only completed \nprobation in August 2018. As such, I find that not enough time has elapsed since his \ncriminal behavior and without recurrence of criminal activity, and the record evidence \nstill casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) \nare not established. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \u201c[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse \nof prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because \n\n \n9 \n \nit raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d and \n\u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \n \nApplicant used marijuana in 2014. He was also convicted in 2011 of \nparaphernalia possession and in 2016 of felony possession with intent to distribute five+ \npounds of marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are established.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n \n \nMore than five years have passed since Applicant\u2019s 2014 marijuana use. There is \nno evidence that he has used marijuana or any other illegal drug, or misused any legal \ndrugs, since 2014. He credibly testified that he is a family man and he no longer \nassociates with the individuals with whom he used marijuana in 2014, and he would \nleave any situation in which illegal drugs were being used or legal drugs were being \nmisused. As he did not provide a signed statement of intent, AG \u00b6 26(b)(3) is not \nestablished as to SOR \u00b6 2.a. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), 26(b)(1), and 26(b)(2) are \nestablished as to SOR \u00b6 2.a, and I find SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, I find that \nnone of the above mitigating conditions are established as to SOR \u00b6 2.b.  \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and H in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the criminal conduct and drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINSTAPPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017 (SOR 1.a, 1.c) The SOR also alleges that Applicant owes unpaid taxes to the federal and state tax agencies. (SOR 1.b, 1.d) Applicant admitted all allegations. Applicant is 57 years old. He has been married for 26 years. He has five children, 41, 40, 37, 27, and 19 years old. The youngest still lives with him. After graduating from high school in 1980, Applicant worked as a messenger, a housekeeper for two or three hotels, and a lead worker custodian for a training company. From 2014 to 2016, he worked for a contractor as a lead maintenance technician at a US Naval installation. From November 2016 to the present, Applicant has been employed through a defense contractor as a cleaner for a federal agency. Applicant\u2019s employment record indicates he has been employed without interruption since April 2004. He has held a clearance granted by another federal agency in 2012. He did not indicate the type of clearance. (GE 1 at 8- 9, 26; GE 3 at 9-10; Tr. 43-44) Applicant did not file his 2013-2017 federal and state tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.d) until July 2018.

In an undated set of interrogatories, Applicant was asked \nto verify the accuracy of interviews he had with investigators from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on November 7 and 9, 2017, and February 6, 2018. He was asked \nand submitted documentation about the status of date-certain federal and state tax \nreturns. The Department of Defense (DOD) could not make the necessary affirmative \nfinding to grant Applicant's security clearance and issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \n1 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non May 30, 2018 to him detailing security reasons under the financial considerations \nguideline (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on October 10, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me April 4, 2019. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 9, 2019, scheduling the \nhearing on June 13, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s three \nexhibits (GE) 1-3 were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s objection to \nGE 2 was overruled and the exhibit was admitted. Applicant\u2019s three exhibits (AE A-C) \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. The record remained open until June 21, \n2019 to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit post-hearing exhibits. Copies of federal \nand state tax documents and other information covering tax years 2013 through 2017 \nwere admitted into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) D-I, without objection. The record \nclosed on July 8, 2019, when the transcript (Tr.) was received. \nRulings on Evidence \nAt the June 2019 hearing, the Government submitted a set of undated \ninterrogatories (GE 3) into evidence. The interrogatories asked Applicant to verify the \naccuracy of his personal subject interviews (PSIs) of November 7 and 9, 2017, February \n6, 2018, and a PSI that is cited as having taken place in May 2016, with investigators from \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Clearly, the May 2016 PSI never occurred \nbecause Applicant did not sign and certify his e-QIP until November 2016. The \ninterrogatories also requested Applicant to answer questions whether he filed missing \nfederal and state tax returns for certain years and how much he owed both tax entities. \nThe pages within the exhibit are numbered in the lower right hand corner of the exhibit. \nApplicant acknowledged the accuracy of the PSIs. However, only the November 7, 2017 \nPSI and an incomplete portion of the November 9, 2017 PSI are included in the exhibit. \nThe February 16, 2018 PSI does not appear with the other two PSIs. On November 26, \n2019, the Government supplied the missing information regarding the November 9, 2017 \nand February 16, 2018 PSIs. The missing information that accurately completes GE 3 is \na one-page document attached to the Government\u2019s November 26, 2019 email (Hearing \nExhibit (HE) 2). The Government has an important responsibility during a security \nadjudication to provide full discovery to an applicant. Toward that end, the Government \nmust ensure that the exhibits it presents in discovery and seeks to enter into the record \nat the hearing are complete copies of exhibits so that an applicant is placed on sufficient \nnotice of the evidence the Government intends to rely on in support of the SOR. The \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate the record do not eliminate the fact that GE 3 was an \nincomplete exhibit when I entered the exhibit into evidence at the June 2019 hearing. (GE \n2 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 at 2-5) Therefore, upon reconsideration, I have admitted GE 3 into evidence, but I have \nreduced the probative weight assigned to this exhibit. \nApplicant signed the interrogatories (GE 3), but the notary is incomplete as only a \nday \u201c15\u201d and a year \u201c2018\u201d appear underneath his signature and above the notary. Based \non the dates posted in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) documents and state tax \ndocument, Applicant most likely submitted his answers to GE 3 in late June or early July \n2018. \nAt the hearing, Applicant objected to the March 2017 credit bureau report (GE 2) \nbecause he had paid all his debts. His objection was overruled. I explained to him that \neven though the exhibit may show he paid all his debts, that claim does not preclude the \nadmissibility of the exhibit into evidence. I also advised him that the report may be \ninterpreted as favorable evidence inferring that he has a habit of paying most of his debts. \nGE 2 was admitted. (GE 2; Tr. 26-28) \nFindings of Fact  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state tax returns for tax \nyears 2013 through 2017 (SOR 1.a, 1.c) The SOR also alleges that Applicant owes unpaid \ntaxes to the federal and state tax agencies. (SOR 1.b, 1.d) Applicant admitted all \nallegations. \nApplicant is 57 years old. He has been married for 26 years. He has five children, \n41, 40, 37, 27, and 19 years old. The youngest still lives with him. After graduating from \nhigh school in 1980, Applicant worked as a messenger, a housekeeper for two or three \nhotels, and a lead worker custodian for a training company. From 2014 to 2016, he worked \nfor a contractor as a lead maintenance technician at a US Naval installation. From \nNovember 2016 to the present, Applicant has been employed through a defense \ncontractor as a cleaner for a federal agency. Applicant\u2019s employment record indicates he \nhas been employed without interruption since April 2004. He has held a clearance granted \nby another federal agency in 2012. He did not indicate the type of clearance. (GE 1 at 8-\n9, 26; GE 3 at 9-10; Tr. 43-44) \nApplicant did not file his 2013-2017 federal and state tax returns (SOR 1.a-1.d) \nuntil July 2018. Though his November 2016 e-QIP response indicates \u201cno\u201d to the question \nof having ever failed to file tax returns or pay taxes in the last seven years, Applicant \ncontends his facility security officer (FSO), who helped him complete the security form, \ninserted a \u201cno\u201d instead of a \u201cyes\u201d response to the question. In his November 2017 PSI \nand his 2018 answers to interrogatories, Applicant indicated he had not filed federal and \nstate tax returns for the years identified in the SOR and owed the federal and state taxes \nidentified in the SOR. Applicant also informed the OPM investigator in November 2017 \n3 \n\n    \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat he was trying to establish a payment plan with the federal tax agency. (GE 1 at 26; \nGE 3 at 5, 11) \nAt the June 2019 hearing, Applicant testified that he had documentation at home \nto verify he filed the missing federal and state tax returns (SOR 1.a, 1.c). Applicant\u2019s \nhearing documentation shows that he filed a federal tax return for 2018 (AE A, unlisted, \nundated, and unsigned). His post-hearing submissions reflect that the missing federal tax \nreturns for 2017, 2016, 2015 (AE E), 2014 (AE F), and 2013 (AE G), were filed in July \n2018. He explained that he did not file his federal and state tax returns on time because \nhe did not have the money to pay the corresponding taxes due and he thought he could \nget away with not filing and paying taxes. His motivation for filing the federal returns was \nto obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 44-47) \nIn November 2018, Applicant initiated payments under a plan he established with \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in October 2018. He claimed that he made nine \npayments under the plan to pay off $36,290. (SOR 1.b) At the hearing, he noted that proof \nof the payments was recorded on his cell phone. In his post-hearing documentation, he \nprovided proof that he made three payments to the IRS in September 2018, February \n2019, and June 2019. As the confirmation receipts show, these payments apply to tax \nyear 2008 (unlisted). The receipts do not show what Applicant\u2019s payment amounts are \nunder the IRS payment plan. The other four payments are to the state tax agency (SOR \n1.d). (Tr. 39; AE H at 1-3) \nIn August 2018, Applicant filed his delinquent state tax returns for tax years 2013 \nthrough 2017 (SOR 1.c). (Tr. 39, 49; AE I) \nWhen the SOR was issued in September 2018, Applicant owed $6,878 to the state \ntax agency. In May 2019, the amount was reduced to $1,888, with Applicant\u2019s next \ninstallment payment due on June 15, 2019. He acknowledged that the large reduction in \ndelinquent state taxes within an eight-month period was due to a $2,200 mistake made \nby the state tax agency in computing the actual amount of back taxes. After subtracting \n$2,200 from the total back tax figure of $6,878, the amount was reduced to $4,678. \nSubtracting Applicant\u2019s 2019 state tax refund of $2,000 from $4,678 leaves a remainder \nof $2,678. Applicant\u2019s documentation reveals that he made four payments totaling $367 \nto the state tax agency. Subtracting $367 from $2,678 leaves a remainder of $2,311, not \n$1,888, the amount posted in the May 2019 state tax agency documentation. There must \nbe other payments that Applicant made but did not submit for entry into the record. (GE 3 \nat 23; Tr. 50-51; AE B; AE H at 4, 5, 7, 9)    \nApplicant earns $59,400 a year or a little over $4,000 a month. His wife has been \nunemployed for almost three years. The record does not reveal the reason for her \nunemployment. According to amounts provided by Applicant, his monthly expenses \ninclude a mortgage of $1,198; a grocery bill of $300; a utility bill of $350; a water bill of \n4 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nabout $68; a cable and telephone bill of $200; medicine of $35; and a home improvement \nbill of $300. His monthly expenses total $2,451, leaving a monthly remainder \n(discretionary income) of approximately $1,549 ($4,000-$2,451). Applicant testified he \nmay have enough money remaining for a family outing every two weeks. He did not \nexplain how and where he spent the balance of the monthly remainder. Applicant has $25 \nin his checking account and no savings or retirement accounts. Though he indicated that \nhe never had financial counseling, he informed the OPM investigator in November 2017 \nthat he used a credit-counseling service to pay delinquent debts to a financial company \nand a landlord. (GE 3 at 12; Tr. 54-58) \nWhen I asked Applicant at the June 2019 hearing what his practice was in filing his \ntax returns before 2013, the first posted year in the SOR when he did not file his federal \nand state tax returns, he responded that it was \u201cgood.\u201d When next questioned about what \n\u201cgood\u201d meant, he replied that his filing practices were \u201cfair.\u201d He then admitted he skipped \nfiling a couple of years before the first listed tax year of 2013 and that was why his current \ndelinquent federal taxes were so high. His three IRS payment confirmation receipts reflect \nthe payments were applied to 2008, probably confirming Applicant\u2019s earlier testimony that \n2013 was not the first year he did not file his federal tax returns. (He was 46 years old in \n2008.) Applicant contended that he had not always known that he could negotiate a \npayment plan (with the IRS) to pay his back taxes. He has always been aware of his legal \nobligation to file his federal and state tax returns. (Tr. 60-62; AE H at 1-3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with \ncommon sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of \nthe national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d   \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations   \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, \nsubstance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as \nit may result from criminal activity, including espionage.  \nPaying voluntarily incurred debts in a timely fashion demonstrates good judgment \nand reliability. Filing federal and state tax returns, and paying corresponding taxes every \nyear in a timely manner also demonstrates good judgment, and accomplishes an \napplicant\u2019s legal obligation to comply with well-established rules and regulations, a key \nfactor for those who seek security clearance eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19. The disqualifying conditions relevant in this case are: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.   \nThe SOR reflects that Applicant did not file federal and state tax returns for 2013 \nthrough 2017. The account transcripts and other documentary information within GE 3 \nsupport the SOR allegations. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203 indicates a failure to file a federal tax \nreturn is a federal criminal offense at the misdemeanor level, irrespective of the tax \nliability. The Government has established a case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) because \nApplicant has incurred a history not meeting financial obligations. His conduct is \nsignificant under AG \u00b6 19(f) because Applicant not filed his federal and state tax returns \n6 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand has failed to pay taxes as required by law. He has the burden of rebutting or mitigating \nGovernment\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Though Applicant has filed the missing federal and \nstate tax returns, he still owes more than $30,000 in federal taxes. He still owes at least \n$1,888 under the state tax agency payment plan. His filing of his 2018 federal tax return \nin a timely fashion does not overshadow his practice of not filing his federal and state tax \nreturns for the previous five years, and continues to raise questions about his reliability \nand judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2016 e-QIP indicates that his employment since 2004 has \nnot been disrupted by any adverse negative action like demotion or unemployment. There \nis no evidence of unforeseen medical issues thwarting Applicant\u2019s ability to file his tax \nreturns. His wife\u2019s unemployment for almost three years carries some probative weight, \nbut Applicant provided no supporting evidence of why his wife was unemployed and how \nit kept Applicant from filing his tax returns. He receives limited mitigation under the first \nprong of AG \u00b6 20(b). He receives negligible mitigation under the second prong of the \ncondition of acting responsibly under the circumstances due to the five-year delay in filing \nhis federal and state tax returns. \n7 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhile Applicant indicated that he has never had financial counseling, he informed \nthe OPM investigator that he utilized some type of credit counseling service to resolve \ntwo of his unlisted delinquent debts. In November 2018, he finally enrolled in a payment \nplan with the IRS, but only submitted three payments under the plan. The dramatic \nreduction in delinquent state tax in a short period was due to the state\u2019s computation error \nand impoundment of Applicant\u2019s 2019 tax refund, rather than regular payments made by \nApplicant under the state\u2019s payment plan. Applicant has not presented a sufficient track \nrecord of payments under either installment plan for me to conclude his tax issues are \nunder control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant filed all the listed federal and state returns in July or August 2018, up to \nfive years late rather than in a timely fashion. When he completed his November 2016 e-\nQIP, he knew he had not timely filed federal and state tax returns in a timely manner. His \nknowledge is supported by his subsequent disclosure to the OPM investigator in \nNovember 2017 that he had directed his FSO to answer \u201cyes\u201d instead of \u201cno\u201d to the tax \nreturn question on his November 2016 e-QIP. Even though Applicant claimed he was \nplanning to enroll in a payment plan with the IRS in November 2017, he did not actually \nenroll until November 2018. On balance, the limited mitigation Applicant receives under \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not surmount the adverse evidence under AG \u00b6 19(a). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to the circumstances of this case because Applicant filed the \nmissing federal and state tax returns. However, the amount of mitigation is limited due to \nthe long period of inaction and the small number of payments made under both plans. \nThe timing of an applicant\u2019s action to resolve his financial problems is an important \nelement of his case in mitigation. If he acts only after being placed on notice that his tax \nissues represent a government concern, he may not have the good judgment to comply \nwith security rules and regulations at all times and in all places, or when there is no \nlooming threat to his personal interests. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state tax \nreturns until July and August 2018, after being aware at least since November 2016 that \nthe missing returns were a government concern, reduces the weight that his corrective \naction would otherwise warrant. \nWhole-Person Concept   \nI have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in \nthe context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n8 \n\n    \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n  \n \n  \n___________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access \nto classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s insufficient-funds-reason for not filing his tax returns does not excuse \nhis legal obligation for file his tax returns. Not filing his tax returns because of his desire \nto escape responsibility of having to pay taxes represents seriously poor judgment that \naggravates Applicant\u2019s conduct. The record shows that Applicant still owes delinquent \nfederal taxes for 2008, five years before he stopped filing federal tax returns for a five-\nyear period beginning in 2013. Applicant has not mitigated the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings  \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion   \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant did not disclose in his 2016 SCA his failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, and that he owed state taxes. He was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2017. During the interview, he volunteered his failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. He failed to disclose he had not filed federal income tax returns for years 2012 and 2016, and state tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Applicant told the investigator that he failed to file because he was living overseas and did not have all the required documents. He promised to file in the coming weeks. He also volunteered that he had failed to disclose in his 2016 SCA that his business credit-card account was cancelled for lack of payments in March 2016.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Eric A. Eisen, Esq. \n01/29/2020 \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2017 and state returns for tax years 2011 through 2017. He also failed to timely \npay his state taxes for tax years 2011-2017. He addressed his delinquent income tax \nreturns, tax debt, and a delinquent credit card debt after he submitted his 2016 security \nclearance application (SCA). His recent efforts are insufficient to establish a track record \nof financial responsibility. He failed to demonstrate good judgment, reliability, and \nwillingness to comply with the law. The financial considerations security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a SCA on May 27, 2016, seeking clearance eligibility for his \nposition with a federal contractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the \nbackground investigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) on September 28, 2018, alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations) and Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant answered the \nSOR on December 6, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge \nfrom the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA assigned the case to another administrative judge on April 4, 2019, and \nissued a notice of hearing on July 17, 2019, convening a hearing on September 19, \n2019. The case was reassigned to me on August 9, 2019. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. At the hearing, the Government offered eight exhibits (GE 1 through 8). \nApplicant testified and submitted eight exhibits (AE 1 through 8). All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. I marked and made part of the record the Government\u2019s \ndiscovery letter (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1). DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 7, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant and the Government stipulated to the current currency \nexchange rate between the United States and France, and to the meaning (translation) \nof French and German documents that Applicant offered into evidence. (Tr. 8-9) \n \nIn Guideline B cases, I am required to consider, among other things, the nature \nof a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord to assess the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. I sua sponte considered a U.S. Department of State note \nconcerning U.S. Relations with France. (See, HE 2; https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-\nwith-france/). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted that, as of September 28, 2018 (the date of the SOR) he: (1) \nhad failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a); (2) had failed to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2011 through \n2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); was indebted to his state for an income tax lien issued in May 2017 \nfor $9,481 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and (3) had an unpaid $7,333 judgment filed against him by a \nbank in November 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  \n \nApplicant did not disclose in his 2016 SCA his failure to timely file federal and \nstate income tax returns, and that he owed state taxes. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator in March 2017. During the interview, he volunteered his failure \nto file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. He failed \nto disclose he had not filed federal income tax returns for years 2012 and 2016, and \nstate tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, and 2016. Applicant told the investigator that \nhe failed to file because he was living overseas and did not have all the required \ndocuments. He promised to file in the coming weeks. He also volunteered that he had \nfailed to disclose in his 2016 SCA that his business credit-card account was cancelled \nfor lack of payments in March 2016. He told the investigator that he had paid the credit-\ncard account in full. He claimed both omissions were an oversight.  \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted that: (1) his wife \nand three children are dual citizens of the United States and France (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n2.b); (2) his in-laws are citizens and residents of France (SOR \u00b6 2.c); (3) he owns a \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhome in France with an estimated value of $600,000, with a $200,000 mortgage (SOR \u00b6 \n2.d); (4) he anticipated receiving $1,000 a month from the French government upon his \nretirement at age 65 (SOR \u00b6 2.e); and (5) he anticipated receiving a $600,000 lump sum \nfrom the Swiss government upon his retirement at age 65 (SOR \u00b6 2.f). \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions, and those at the hearing, are incorporated herein \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 1976, completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1981, and a master\u2019s degree in \n1988. All his education was completed in U.S. academic institutions. While in college, \nhe started working part time for a federal agency. After earning his master\u2019s degree, \nApplicant was hired full time by the federal agency and worked abroad between 1989 \nand 1999. The federal agency granted him access to classified information at the top-\nsecret level. While employed with the federal agency, Applicant contributed into its thrift \nsavings plan and currently has a balance of about $201,000. (AE 7)  \n \nAfter leaving the federal agency, Applicant worked for a large international \ncorporation between 1999 and 2004, and lectured at a French University between 2000 \nand 2005. Between 2004 and 2012, Applicant worked for a private company in \nSwitzerland, and between around 2011 and 2012, he worked for a private company in a \nMiddle Eastern country. He worked for a private company in France between 2012 and \n2014. He returned to the United States in 2014, because his father was ill. He has been \nworking as vice-president for a federal contractor, his clearance sponsor, since 2014. \n \nApplicant married a French citizen in 1986 in France. They have three children, \nages 31, and 28 (twins). His wife and children are now dual citizens of the United States \nand France. He testified that he still provides financial assistance to all of his children. \nHis older daughter lives in France in the house Applicant purchased in 2005 for about \n$620,000. He estimated the value of the property at $650,000 when he completed his \n2016 SCA. At hearing, Applicant claimed the property value was currently closer to \n$400,000. He submitted no documentary evidence concerning the current value of his \nFrench property. \n \nApplicant opened a bank account in France while he was working there between \n1989 and 1999. He currently maintains approximately $9,000 in the account to pay for \nhis living expenses when he travels to France, for his daughter\u2019s financial assistance, \nand to pay the mortgage on the home in France. Additionally, he disclosed having a \nSwiss bank account with about $150 (GE 2), and a Swiss retirement account with an \nestimated value of $600,000. At the time he completed the 2016 SCA, Applicant \nbelieved he was entitled to French social security benefits, which he estimated at \n$1,000 per month after age 65. \n \nApplicant claimed that while working for the U.S. federal agency in France, he \nalways filed his income tax returns and paid his taxes on time. He stated that he later \n\n \n4 \n \n \npaid income taxes to Switzerland, because he worked there, and property taxes to \nFrance, because he owns a house there. He explained that he was \u201cgetting lazy and \nfiling his taxes in batches, two or three years at a time.\u201d (Tr. 35-36) Applicant mistakenly \nbelieved he owed no taxes to the federal government because he was taking minimum \ndeductions and the first $100,000 of income was not taxable under the foreign income \ntax deduction. (Tr. 36-37) \n \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2012 in March 2017. For \ntax year 2013, he filed his federal income tax return in March 2019. The 2013 IRS \naccount transcript indicates he was assessed a penalty for filing his 2013 return late \n($216), and paid interest for late payment of taxes ($233). For tax year 2014, he filed his \nfederal income tax return in December 2018. The 2014 IRS account transcript indicates \nhe had filed for an extension of time to file his 2014 tax return, but did not file the return \nuntil 2018. \n \nFor tax year 2015, Applicant filed his federal income tax return in June 2019. The \n2015 IRS account transcript indicates he was assessed a penalty for late filing, and paid \na penalty for late payment of taxes ($558) and was charged interest ($1,416). For tax \nyear 2016, he filed his federal income tax return in July 2018. The 2016 IRS account \ntranscript indicates he had a $6,800 credit. For tax year 2017, he filed his federal \nincome tax return in December 2018. The 2017 IRS account transcript indicates he had \na $14,661 credit. For tax year 2018, he timely filed his federal income tax return in April \n2019. \n \nApplicant filed his state income tax returns for years 2011 through 2017 in 2019. \nAs of August 26, 2019, he had an outstanding state tax debt of about $107,668, plus \n$2,587 for penalties and interest accrued. He paid his state tax debt in full in August 29, \n2019. The state tax judgment against him was removed upon payment of the tax debt. \n(AE 3, SOR \u00b6 2.c) Additionally, he presented documentary evidence showing that a \nbank lien filed against his property was released after payment of the debt in July 2019. \n(AE 1 and 2; SOR \u00b6 2.d) \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that there were numerous reasons for his \nfailure to timely file his income tax returns: (1) he was distracted about his tax filing \nobligations because he had to return to the United States in 2014 to be with his father \nwho was seriously ill and passed away in 2014; (2) he was earning about $500,000 a \nyear abroad, and when he returned to the United States, he lost half of his earnings; (3) \nafter his father died in 2014, the executor of the estate failed to resolve the estate and \nthere were tax problems associated with it; (4) he was unconcerned about filing his \nfederal income tax returns because he believed he was paying any taxes owed through \nhis withholdings; (5) in 2013, he started to receive income from his beach rental \nproperty and he did not know how to file the income tax returns; and (6) he failed to \nseek help from a tax professional.  \n \nConcerning his Swiss retirement account with an estimated value of $600,000, \nApplicant received a lump-sum payment of $491,504 and transferred the money to a \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnited States bank, except for $43,000 Swiss francs that Switzerland retained, in 2019. \nApplicant testified that he used the lump-sum payment to pay off all of his delinquent \ndebts and past-due taxes. (AE 6; Tr. 46)  \n \nConcerning the anticipated $1,000 a month French social security pension upon \nhis retirement at age 65, Applicant testified that he was mistaken about it. He now \nbelieves that he needed to work and contribute into the French retirement system for 10 \nyears to vest into the French social security pension plan. Because he only worked and \ncontributed during seven years, he now believes he is not entitled to any pension.  \n \nIn 2011, Applicant purchased land in a U.S. state to build a beach retirement \nhome. He completed construction of the home in 2013. Since then, he has been using \nthe beach property as a business property where he rents it most of the year, except for \nthe time when he and his family use it during the summers. Applicant\u2019s beach property \nhas an estimated market value of $1.2 million. He owes $261,000 on the house \nmortgage, plus an additional $170,000 on a home equity loan. (AE 5) \n \nApplicant anticipates retiring in the United States in about five years, after paying \nall of his mortgages. He intends to live at his U.S. beach property, and to travel to \nFrance once in a while to visit his daughter and his wife\u2019s relatives. He was issued a \nFrench \u201cgreen card\u201d when he lived in France, but it expired in July 2019. He claimed he \ncannot renew it because he no longer lives in France. It is not clear whether he and his \nwife owning property in France is a consideration for his eligibility to renew his French \n\u201cgreen card.\u201d (Tr. 74) \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for not filing his income tax returns on time. He \nclaimed that he has learned a hard lesson and promised to timely file his income tax \nreturns and to pay his taxes in the future. Applicant presented little documentary \nevidence to show that he had contact with the IRS, the state tax authority, or his bank \ncreditor before he submitted his 2016 SCA.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant highlighted his work abroad in an important position for \na federal agency for about 10 years. During that period, he represented U.S. interests in \nseveral foreign countries. He believes his past employment and behavior have proven \nthat he is not a security risk. Applicant noted that his current earnings are sufficient to \npay his financial obligations and living expenses. Moreover, he established that the \nvalue of his assets in the United States exceeds the value of his assets in any foreign \ncountry, including France. I find that he participated in financial counseling provided by \nhis attorney. \n \nApplicant submitted reference statements from two long-time friends, one of \nwhich was also a professional colleague, and a retired U.S. major general. His \nreferences consider Applicant to be trustworthy, reliable, diligent, and a loyal American \npatriot. They recommended Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance without reservations. \n(AE 8) \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nhttps://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-france/\n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \n\n \n7 \n \n \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2017, and his state returns for tax years 2011 through 2017. Additionally, he \nfailed to timely pay his federal income tax for two tax years, and his state tax for tax \nyears 2011 through 2017. AG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord establishes both disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and (f), requiring additional \ninquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that none of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently established by the evidence to mitigate the financial considerations \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant failed to file income tax returns \nand to pay taxes repeatedly over many years and he only recently corrected his tax \nproblems.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father illness and passing away, him losing half of his earnings, and \nthe problems resolving his father\u2019s estate could be considered as circumstances beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control that adversely affected his record collection and application of his \ntime and energy to address his taxes. Notwithstanding, these circumstances are \ninsufficient to show he was financially responsibly under the circumstances. \n \nApplicant has taken important steps towards showing his financial responsibility. \nHe filed all his delinquent federal and state tax returns and paid all of his delinquent \ntaxes. The state tax judgment against him was removed upon payment of the tax debt. \nAdditionally, the bank lien filed against him was released after full payment of the debt \nin July 2019.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s filings of federal tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2017, and his state tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2017, were not \ntimely. Additionally he failed to timely pay his federal taxes for at least two tax years (he \nwas assessed interests and penalties), and he did not timely pay his state taxes for tax \nyears 2011 through 2017.  \n \nConcerning an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file federal and state income tax \nreturns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original).  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful \nconsideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax \nreturns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) \n(characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and \nemploying an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of \naccess to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt \nof the SOR).   \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies because he filed his tax returns and paid his required taxes; \nhowever, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed \nthe grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal \nincome tax returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his \nbackground interview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such \nremedial action might otherwise merit. \n \nIn this case, Applicant submitted his SCA in 2016. He did not start to file his \nfederal income tax return for tax year 2012 until 2017. There is insufficient evidence \nabout why Applicant was unable to file his federal and state tax returns on time. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his federal and state income tax returns in a timely manner, and \nhis failure to pay his debts does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information. See, ISCR Case \nNo. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). Under all the circumstances, including the \njurisprudence from the DOHA Appeal Board, he failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \n  \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \n\n \n11 \n \n \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and children are dual citizens of the United States and France. \nHis in-laws are citizens and residents of France. His older child is a resident of France. \nHe owns a home with an estimated value of $650,000, with an outstanding mortgage of \nabout $200,000, and he maintains a French bank account for his convenience. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:    \n  \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nThe Government did not submit evidence of a significant threat of terror and \nongoing human rights problems in France. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a \npotential conflict of interest, but there is no evidence of a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. Disqualifying condition \nAG \u00b6 7(a) is not established. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and (f) are established \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s close family connections with his in-laws in France, and his \nsubstantial property interest in that country. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:   \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict of could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to France as well as each \nindividual family tie. Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have \naccess to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign \ncountry is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. After completing his master\u2019s degree, he worked \nwith an important federal agency abroad for almost 10 years. He returned to the United \nStates when his father was ill. He has remained in the United States and credibly \n\n \n13 \n \n \ntestified that he intends to retire and live in the United States. I find his French property \nand other financial interests abroad are outweighed by the assets he has in the United \nStates. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to France (mostly via his wife and in-laws) are outweighed by his \ndeep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States. I find that it is \nunlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests \nof the United States and the interests of France. Moreover, Applicant has demonstrated \nthat there would be no conflict of interest because he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(f) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of these factors were addressed under those guideline, but some \nwarrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has about 10 \nyears of service for a federal agency working abroad. He held a clearance while working \nfor the federal agency. Additionally, he has an impressive work resume detailing \nimportant work for multinational corporations in high-paying positions. He has been \nworking for a federal contractor, his security sponsor, since 2014. \n \nThe evidence against grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. When \na tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an \napplicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax returns, \nand how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete making \npayments. \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant \nof security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency \nfor years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in jeopardy \nundercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not reflect \nthe voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with \nthe nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of \ncircumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax \nliens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and emphasizing the \napplicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. \nOct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, \nand insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax \ndebts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board \nhighlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, \ncontributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and expenses, and \nspouse\u2019s serious medical problems.  \n \nThe Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax \nreturns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest \nthat an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules \nand systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, \nnoting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating \u201cA security clearance \nrepresents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national \nsecrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct \nbearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problem here is that Applicant knew that he needed to file his state \nand federal income tax returns for several years. He testified that he timely filed his \nstate and federal income tax returns while working for the federal agency. He knew he \nhad a requirement to timely file his federal and state tax returns while working for \nmultinational corporations abroad and after he returned to the United States in 2014. He \nprocrastinated and failed to demonstrate good judgment and reliability. He has a \nproblem complying with well-established rules. His recent actions to resolve his tax \nproblems are insufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security \nconcerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not \nwarranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that \nApplicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security \nclearance in the future. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n  \n   \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, and \nmitigate the security concern stemming from his problematic financial history. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging that \nhis circumstances raised security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive). The Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017, apply \nhere. Applicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2018, and requested a hearing to \nestablish his eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n2 \n \nI was assigned the case on February 2, 2019. On May 22, 2019, a date mutually \nagreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. Applicant testified at the hearing. The \nGovernment offered three exhibits, which were marked for identification as GE 1 through \n3, and which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered no exhibits. The transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) was received on June 5, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, a high school graduate who has some college credits \nand is pursuing a college degree predicted in 2022. He has never been married and has \nno children. Since February 2011, Applicant has been employed by defense contractors. \nHe has had a secret clearance since 2005. From December 2010 until February 2011, \nApplicant was unemployed. (GE 1.)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 10 delinquent accounts totaling $38,518.  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.) The Government moved to amend the SOR to withdraw SOR \u00b6 1.i as being a \nduplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.h. I granted the motion without objection. (Tr. 11-12.) Applicant \nadmitted all of the alleged accounts. (Answer.)  \nApplicant testified about the status of the delinquent SOR debts. Those debts \nbecame delinquent in 2015 or 2016, because Applicant stopped payments on them or \nwas inconsistent in making payments when they came due. Applicant has not contacted \nthose creditors to set up payment plans.  He plans, however, to pay those creditors in the \nfuture.  Applicant spoke with a credit repair agency in about September 2018, but he has \nnot followed up on that approach. Finally, Applicant has had no financial counseling but \nhoped to enroll in one in the month or so after the hearing. (Tr. 27-35, 37-38, 43-44, 52-\n54; GE 2; GE 3.) \nApplicant testified about the circumstances that caused his financial problems. He \npointed to a decline of overtime opportunities with his current employer. As the unpaid \nbills began to mount, Applicant became overwhelmed. Applicant also pointed to \u201cbad \ninvestments,\u201d notably a car he purchased new in 2014 that cost $30,000.  Applicant also \nadmitted to having been financially irresponsible.  Any financial assistance he provided \nto his mother did not cause his financial problems. (Tr. 24-25, 31-32, 51-52, 54.) \nApplicant makes between $60,000 and $65,000 per year depending on the \navailability of overtime. Applicant\u2019s rent is $1,305 per month. He currently drives a 2009 \ncar he purchased used and pays $385 per month for it. Applicant has no savings account. \nHe has a 401(k) account with a balance of about $10,000. Applicant tried to withdraw \nfunds from that account to pay some of his debts but was told he could not do so, because \nhe needed a recognized hardship to withdraw funds. He is current on his state and federal \nincome taxes. Applicant teaches music daily in elementary, middle, and high schools, but \nis not paid.  Applicant\u2019s daily routine begins at about 2:30 a.m. to get to his full-time job \nby 4:00 a.m. After work, he then attends his college courses. Applicant then goes to his \nteaching job. (Tr. 19, 22, 30, 45, 48-53.) \n \n \n\n3 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe financial considerations security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n     (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. The next question is \nwhether any mitigating conditions apply.   \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n     \n \nAlthough the SOR debts might have been incurred several years ago, they \ncurrently remain delinquent. Nor are the delinquent debts infrequent; there are numerous \nsuch debts. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n\n5 \n \n \nApplicant explained candidly that his financial problems were due to certain bad \ninvestments and his own irresponsibility, both largely within his control. On this record, \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant has not made any payments on any of the SOR debts. Nor has he set \nup any payment plans for any of those debts. Applicant has not submitted any documents \nshowing the existence of such a plan, nor any documents showing a track record of \nadhering to any plan. A promise or a stated intent to pay debts is not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt payment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, \n2015). AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.  \n \nThe record raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. (AG \u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9).) \n \n Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Moss, Esq. \n \n03/12/2020 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the personal conduct and use of information \ntechnology security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 23, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct) and M (use of information technology). Applicant responded to the SOR on \nSeptember 12, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case \nwas assigned to me on November 26, 2019. A hearing scheduled for January 29, 2020, \nwas cancelled. The hearing was convened as rescheduled on February 20, 2020.  \n \nEvidence \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The objection to a section of GE 4 was overruled, and GE 4 was admitted in \nits entirety. Applicant testified and called two witnesses. Department Counsel objected \nto the testimony of one of Applicant\u2019s witnesses on the grounds that the witness was not \n\n \n2 \n \nan expert and the testimony was not relevant. The objections were overruled. \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) 1 through 11 were admitted without objection. The record was \nheld open for Applicant to submit additional information. He submitted documents that I \nhave marked AE 12 through 15 and admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the Air \nNational Guard from 1996 until he was honorably discharged in 2002. He graduated \nfrom law school in 2008. He is married with children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 57, 159; GE 1-\n3; AE 9) \n \nApplicant worked in software development before he went to law school. He \npracticed law for a period, but then went back to software development. He worked for a \ndefense contractor from 2009 to 2017, primarily as a software developer and system \nadministrator at a DOD agency. (Tr. at 57-60, 87; GE 1-3) \n \nIn August 2017, the DOD agency notified the Inspector General (IG) that during \nroutine monitoring of Internet usage and network traffic, they detected that Applicant \nused a government information technology (IT) system to view illicit material containing \nsexual content, which was against the agency\u2019s IT policy. The report indicated: \n \n\uf0b7 In January 2017, Applicant searched Google for \u201cgirl rubbing herself.\u201d The search \ncontained nude images and sexual content. \n \n\uf0b7 In June 2017, Applicant searched Google for \u201crubbing her [vulgar term for \nvagina].\u201d The search contained nude images and sexual content. \n \n\uf0b7 In June 2017, Applicant searched Google for \u201cfemale oral.\u201d Applicant then viewed \nseveral pages of nude images of men and women engaged in sexual acts. (GE \n4) \n \nThe agency further reported that since 2012, Applicant had been involved in 19 \nother cases of unauthorized software downloads. The software included graphics, audio \nand music editing software, bar examination preparation software, and text editing \nsoftware. The agency noted that Applicant was sent a user account-violation warning \nletter on a specific date in April 2016. (GE 4, 5) \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant\u2019s access to the DOD agency\u2019s network was \nsuspended, and he was escorted off the premises. He asserted that he was not told the \nreason. He wrote an e-mail with a copy to the IG. He thought the IG might already have \nan open investigation, and he was \u201cconcerned that [he] was being inappropriately \nremoved\u201d from the contract. He wrote: \u201cIf the reason that I\u2019m being removed for is \nworking on [an]other project for another company, during contract hours, I would like to \nexplain.\u201d He indicated that during lulls in work or when he needed a break, he would \npractice programming on his personal websites. (Tr. at 111-117; GE 4, 6) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe IG obtained a report of Applicant\u2019s unclassified Internet usage. From March \n2017 through August 2017, Applicant visited his personal websites 1,015 times. The IG \ncontacted an unidentified individual, who stated that Applicant\u2019s use of his personal \nwebsites for duty-related purposes was not in compliance with the contract statement of \nwork (SOW). (GE 6) \n \nApplicant was interviewed over the telephone by an IG investigator in December \n2017. He stated that he used his personal websites to practice programming and \ndevelop solutions for site problems at the DOD agency. He estimated that from March \n2017 to August 2017, he visited his personal websites about three to four times per \nweek, for up to two hours per day. The IG estimated that equated to between 150 and \n200 hours at an hourly rate of $153, or between $23,071 and $30,762. The IG \nconcluded that Applicant committed contractor cost mischarging (labor hours) when he \nsubmitted fraudulent timesheets that included 150 to 200 hours that he spent working \non tasks not specified in the contract SOW. The U.S. Government apparently recouped \nan amount in the above range from a defense contractor. (Tr. at 113-121, 148-151; GE \n6) \n \nApplicant denied some of the conduct and explained the rest. He admitted that \nhe downloaded software, but he stated that it was primarily for his job. He was a data \ntransfer officer (DTO) who would download items for others. He admitted downloading a \nfew programs that were not for his job, such as a Sudoku solver and an audio \nmanipulation program that he used to make old songs sound better. He does not recall \ndownloading the bar examination preparation software, but he surmises that he likely \ndid. He stated that employees were permitted incidental non-official use of their \ncomputers, and he did not realize that he was unauthorized to download any of the \nsoftware. He denied ever receiving a warning letter. He stated that the only thing he was \ntold was that the Sudoku solver was unauthorized, and it was deleted from his system. \n(Tr. at 59-70, 85-86, 123-127, 153-155; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \n \nApplicant denied intentionally submitting fraudulent timesheets. He asserted that \nhis use of his websites was to hone his skills as a software developer or to benefit the \nDOD agency. Additionally, incidental non-official use of the computer was permitted. \n(Tr. at 59-60, 86-101, 141-153, 156-159; AE 5-7) \n \nApplicant admitted that he conducted the Google searches on the government IT \nsystem, which revealed inappropriate material, but he denied that he viewed sexually \nexplicit material. Applicant was involved in an online affair with a woman he had never \nmet in person. The affair included graphic chats and exchanges from his phone, which \ninvolved sexually explicit materials and \u201cphone sex.\u201d He wanted to send her flirtatious \nand suggestive material with \u201cnon-explicit but sexual images\u201d using the GIF (Graphics \nInterchange Format - short animated or moving pictures) format over the government IT \nsystem. He knew the system had SafeSearch, which would screen out most, but not all, \ngraphic materials. He admitted that even with SafeSearch on, he \u201ccame across explicit \nimages a few times. [He] did not download these and browsed away quickly, or closed \nthe browser.\u201d He also admitted that he \u201chad several inappropriate text conversations\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \nwith the woman from a government computer. (Tr. at 71-77, 82-84, 102-106, 128-141, \n155-156; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE 3, 4, 15) \n \nApplicant described one of the GIFs he sent as what appeared to be a man \nperforming oral sex on a woman. Another was of a woman with her hand inside her \nunderwear apparently masturbating. He asserted that there was no visible nudity or \ngenitalia in any of the GIFs. (Tr. at 71-72, 83-84, 133-134; GE 2, 3; AE 3) \n \nApplicant stated that his affair with the woman ended in August 2017, a few days \nbefore he was removed from the contract. He asserted that he was never told why he \nwas removed from the contract. He thought the affair itself, but not necessarily the \ninappropriate searches, might have been discovered. He stated that he did not think the \ninappropriate searches and images were an issue until he thought it through about a \nweek or two after he was removed from the contract. He told his wife of the online affair \nin August 2017. He also sought advice and counseling through his church. (Tr. at 78-80, \n101, 106-113; AE 4, 9, 14) \n \nApplicant thought the affair could have been \u201ca point of blackmail.\u201d He indicated \nthat he \u201cdrafted a letter to self-report in August of 2017 but was advised to not report by \na trusted advisor.\u201d He discussed the information during his background interview in \nMarch 2018. He reported the information to his facility security officer (FSO) in April \n2018. In that report, he indicated the incidents happened \u201c[d]uring a rough patch in [his] \nmarriage in May-July 2017.\u201d When asked at hearing how that accounted for his search \nin January 2017, he stated that he and the woman were friends before January 2017, \nand the flirtatious behavior, but not the full online affair, started in January 2017. (Tr. at \n78, 107-111, 131-132; AE 4, 14) \n \nApplicant apologized for his inappropriate conduct. His actions cost him his job \nand almost his marriage. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, \nand that the conduct will not be repeated. (Tr. at 81-82, 121-122, 137) \n \nApplicant volunteers in his community, and he is active in his church. He \nsubmitted documents and letters attesting to his moral character and excellent job \nperformance. He is praised for his work ethic, honesty, trustworthiness, judgment, \nloyalty, strength, determination, dependability, integrity, and willingness and ability to \nprotect classified information. He is recommended for a security clearance. (Tr. at 18-\n35, 51-54; AE 8-13) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \n \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and  \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \n \n \nApplicant used a DOD agency\u2019s IT system to view illicit material containing \nsexual content, which was against the agency\u2019s IT policy. He also downloaded software \nonto the agency\u2019s IT system without authorization. The above disqualifying conditions \nare applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness. \n \n \nApplicant downloaded software onto the agency\u2019s IT system without \nauthorization. I do not find that conduct, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, warrants the loss of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance, and it is mitigated.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI am convinced that Applicant received a user account-violation warning letter in \nApril 2016. Applicant is an attorney, a software developer, and a system administrator. \nHe did not need that letter to know that his Google searches on the government IT \nsystem for sexual materials were forbidden. However, the letter served to firmly place \nhim on notice that further misconduct would not be tolerated. Applicant admitted that his \nsearches revealed sexually explicit images on two occasions, which means he went \nback at least once after he knew that sexually explicit materials could result. \nAdditionally, I am not convinced that Applicant has been completely candid. His conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n41(a) and 41(b) are not applicable to the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n\n \n8 \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThe use of information technology security concerns are cross-alleged under \nGuideline E. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable to the \nallegation that Applicant downloaded software onto the agency\u2019s IT system without \nauthorization. It is not perfectly applicable to the allegation that he used a DOD \nagency\u2019s IT system to view illicit material containing sexual content because that \nconduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the use of information \ntechnology guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable judgment and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) \nare established.  \n \nAlso alleged under Guideline E is that Applicant submitted fraudulent timesheets \nand overcharged the Government for approximately 150 to 200 hours of work, which \namounted to about $23,000 to $30,000. I am satisfied that Applicant used his computer \nfor non-official purposes. Like virtually every employee, there were times when he was \non the clock but not actually working. I am not convinced that it rose to the level of \u201ca \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations,\u201d or \u201csignificant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nThe above analysis under the use of information technology guideline applies \nhere. The allegation that Applicant downloaded software onto the agency\u2019s IT system \n\n \n9 \n \nwithout authorization is mitigated. The allegation that he used the agency\u2019s IT system to \nview illicit material containing sexual content is not mitigated. That conduct continues to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating \nfactors, individually or collectively, are insufficient to dispel the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s strong character evidence, but the favorable information is insufficient to \novercome his incidents involving questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and use of information technology security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 21, 2017. On \nSeptember 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (SEAD 4). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 17, 2018. On October 23, 2018, he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on November 16, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on February 14, 2019. \nOn April 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \nthat the hearing was scheduled for May 2, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were \nadmitted without objection. I kept the record open until May 17, 2019, to enable him to \nsubmit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AE E, which was admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments about AE E are attached to the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 22, 2019. \n \nEvidentiary Issue \n \nGE 2 is a summary of an interview of Applicant by a security investigator on \nJanuary 23, 2018, with follow-up interviews on January 31, 2018 and June 5, 2018. The \nsummary was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Applicant did not \nobject to the admission of GE 2, but my review of the record has caused me to doubt \nwhether Applicant understood that GE 2 was not admissible unless he waived the \nauthentication requirement. Accordingly, I have not considered GE 2 in my decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His \nadmission in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old security officer employed by a federal contractor since \nAugust 2016. He was self-employed from August 2007 to August 2011. He worked as an \nunarmed security officer for a non-governmental employer from August 2011 until he was \nhired for his current job, initially as an unarmed security officer. He received technical \ntraining and became an armed special security officer in February 2017. He has never \nheld a security clearance. \n \nApplicant married in March 2006 and has two children, ages nine and four. He also \nhas had custody of his 18-year-old niece since 2013, because her parents are deceased. \n(Tr. 25-26.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $23,000. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from December 2017 (GE 2) and August 2018 (GE 3), and court \nrecords reflecting judgments entered against Applicant in November 2017, September \n2013, and July 2011 (GE 5.)  \n \nIn 2018, Applicant hired a financial advisor in 2018 to devise a budget, contact \ncreditors, and supervise his compliance with his budget and payment plans. (AE B.) He \npays her $250 every two weeks for her services. (Tr. 40-41.) He testified that she builds \nup a \u201cpiggybank\u201d that she uses to negotiate settlements. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant testified \nthat he could obtain documentation of the amount of money in the \u201cpiggybank\u201d and her \nplan for settling his debts. (Tr. 47.) He did not submit any such documentation. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nIn February 2019, Applicant hired a law firm specializing in credit repair. He pays \nthe firm $100 per month. (Tr. 69-70.) The law firm sent out two \u201cinterventions,\u201d demanding \ninformation and validation of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and another debt not alleged \nin the SOR. The firm also sent five \u201cchallenges\u201d to the credit bureaus regarding the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and1.h as well as another debt not alleged in the SOR. (AC C.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial advisor submitted the answer to the SOR on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. She did not testify or participate in the hearing. The SOR answer included copies \nof letters dated August 29, 2018, each captioned as a \u201cProposal of Settlement\u201d and \nproposing monthly payments to the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j.  \n \nOn May 11, 2019, six days before the record closed, Applicant\u2019s financial advisor \nsubmitted a written description of payments and payment agreements for each debt \nalleged in the SOR, except the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. Her submission indicates that \nevery debt alleged in the SOR is either resolved or is in the process of being resolved. \nHowever, she submitted no documentation to support her submission. She stated that \nadditional documentation was forthcoming. (AE E.) However, the record contains no \nadditional documentation. The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: deficiency of about $5,537 after vehicle repossession. Applicant \nobtained a vehicle loan in August 2013, and the vehicle was repossessed in December \n2013. (GE 4 at 2.) Applicant testified that he had documents showing that the debt was \npaid in full, but he did not submit anything at the hearing. (Tr. 45.) In her post-hearing \nsubmission, Applicant\u2019s financial advisor stated that this debt was paid in full. She did not \nsubmit any documentation showing that the debt was resolved, but stated that she was \nawaiting documentation and an order of satisfaction. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account past due for $199, with a balance of $948. \nApplicant\u2019s financial advisor\u2019s post-hearing submission stated that the balance had been \nreduced to $240 and would be paid off in June 2019. She did not submit any evidence of \npayments or the reduced balance.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $430. At the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted evidence that his balance was $442, with a minimum payment of $103 due in \nApril 2019. (AE D.) The financial advisor\u2019s post-hearing submission stated that the \ncreditor had agreed to settle the debt for $300 and that the balance due was $150. She \ndid not submit any documentation of a settlement agreement or any payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e: credit-card account charged off for $338 and line of \ncredit charged off for $95. The financial advisor\u2019s post-hearing submission stated that \nthese debts were paid in full, but her submission did not include any documentation of \npayments. She stated that she was awaiting documentation from the creditors. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: telecommunications account placed for collection of about $1,000. \nThe December 2017 credit report reflected that this debt was disputed. It was placed for \n\n \n4 \n \ncollection in December 2015. (GE 3 at 3.) Applicant submitted no documentation of \npayments, payment agreements, or other resolution of this debt. However, the debt is not \nreflected in the August 2018 credit report (GE 4.) Since the debt is too recent to have \n\u201caged off\u201d Applicant\u2019s credit report under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its absence from \nthe more recent credit report indicates that the dispute was resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: judgment obtained by automobile dealer in 2000 for $600. The \nfinancial advisor\u2019s post-hearing submission stated that the creditor agreed to settle this \ndebt for $300, had accepted a payment of $50, and that the balance is $100. She \nsubmitted no documentation of a settlement agreement or payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: judgment obtained by collection agency in 2017 for a deficiency \nof $11,333 after an automobile repossession. Applicant purchased a van for his mother \nin May 2015, and she helped him make the payments. His mother was injured in a vehicle \naccident and could no longer drive or assist Applicant with the payments. He voluntarily \nsurrendered the vehicle when he could no longer afford the payments. (Tr. 31-32.) The \nvehicle was repossessed in March 2017 and the judgment for the deficiency was entered \nin November 2017. (GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at 1.) Applicant\u2019s pay is being garnished for $175 \nevery two-week pay period to satisfy the judgment. The balance due as of April 25, 2019 \nwas $7,779. Interest continues to accrue on this judgment at $10%, which computes to \n$2.11 per day on the principal amount. (AX A.) Applicant testified that the creditor is willing \nto settle the debt for less than the full amount, and he hoped that his federal income tax \nrefund for a \u201cfew thousand\u201d would allow him to settle the debt. (Tr. 33-34.) At the hearing, \nApplicant submitted a letter from his financial advisor, explaining that garnishment left him \ninsufficient funds to pay other creditors. (AE B.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: judgment obtained by medical provider in 2013 for $1,176. \nApplicant co-signed the contract for this debt, incurred by his 76-year-old mother. (Tr. 34-\n37.) The financial advisor\u2019s post-hearing submission stated that the creditor agreed to \nsettle this debt for $700, to be paid in monthly $100 installments. She submitted no \ndocumentation of a payment agreement or any payments.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: lien obtained by fitness club in 2011 for $1,457. The financial \nadvisor\u2019s post-hearing submission stated that the creditor agreed to settle this debt for \n$750, to be paid by monthly $50 payments. She submitted no documentation of a \npayment agreement or any payments. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s income varies between $3,300 and $4,200, depending on the number \nof hours he works. He has a second job providing private security on Friday and Saturday \nnights, and he earns about $600 per month. He is looking for a third job. (Tr. 70.) His wife \nis employed and earns about $1,400 per month. (Tr. 48-49.) Applicant\u2019s mother now lives \nwith his sister, and he sends his sister $500 to $700 every other month to help defray \ntheir living expenses. (Tr. 52.) Applicant\u2019s niece is now in college and has a scholarship, \nbut he sends her money from time to time. (Tr. 53.) \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n\n \n6 \n \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his \nsecurity clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d), AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The injury of Applicant\u2019s mother and the \nuntimely deaths of his 18-year-old niece\u2019s parents were conditions largely beyond his \ncontrol. His decision to seek professional help in resolving his debt was responsible \nconduct, but his failure to adequately monitor his financial advisor\u2019s activities and to obtain \ndocumentation of her financial management was not responsible. He is paying his \nfinancial advisor $500 a month, but at the hearing, he did not know how much money was \nin his financial advisor\u2019s \u201cpiggybank,\u201d he had only a vague notion of her overall strategy, \nand he was unaware of her specific plans for specific creditors.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has engaged the services of a financial \nadvisor. However, the lack of documentation showing payments, payment agreements, \nor other resolution of Applicant\u2019s debts precludes a finding that there are \u201cclear \nindications\u201d that his financial problems are being resolved.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s pay is being garnished to satisfy the \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, but payment by involuntary garnishment is not a good-\nfaith initiation of repayment. ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011.) Although \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission asserts that all the debts alleged in the SOR have \nbeen paid or are being paid, but he has submitted no documentation of payments, \npayment agreements, or other resolution of the debts. It is reasonable to expect an \napplicant to present documentary evidence showing resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The credit report from \nDecember 2017 indicated that the debt was disputed, and it does not appear on the \nsubsequent August 2018 credit report. Since the debt is too recent to have \u201caged off\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s credit record under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c (FCRA), \nits deletion from his credit record indicates that that the dispute was resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Under the FCRA, , a credit report may not list accounts placed for \ncollection, charged off debts, or civil judgments that antedate the credit report by more \n\n \n8 \n \nthan seven years, or until the statute of limitations has run, whichever is longer. There are \nexceptions to this prohibition, but they do not apply to this case. This mitigating condition \nis not established for the other debts alleged in the SOR, which Applicant has not \ndisputed.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant was sincere and candid at the hearing. He is deeply devoted to his family \nand generous to a fault. At the hearing and in the post-hearing submission, submitted on \nMay 11, 2019, six days before the record closed, and his financial advisor stated that \nmore evidence was forthcoming, showing that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and \n1.e had been paid in full and that the creditors had agreed to settle the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and 1.i for less than the full amount. However, Applicant submitted \nnothing further. The Directive makes it clear that it is responsibility of the parties to present \nevidence for the administrative judge\u2019s consideration. ISCR Case No. 08-10170 (App. Bd. \nJul. 8, 2011). The Directive does not authorize an administrative judge to act as an \ninvestigator for either party in a security clearance proceeding. ISCR Case No. 15-01515 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2016.)  \n \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there \nis a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd.

National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 17, 2018, Applicant completed and signed his security clearance \napplication (SCA). On September 27, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 1, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. He admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g, and he \ndenied \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f. This hearing was continued due to a family emergency by the \nApplicant in March 2019. Applicant requested a continuance, which I granted for good \n\n \n2 \n \ncause. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) reissued the hearing notice \non September 16, 2019, after Applicant agreed to participate in a video-teleconference \n(VTC) hearing on September 26, 2019. During the VTC hearing, Applicant testified, \nhowever the video equipment had technical difficulties, and another hearing was \nrescheduled for January 13, 2020, to conclude the hearing.  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and Applicant \ndid not offer any documents. I admitted GE 1-3 into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified during both the September 26, 2019, and the January 13, 2020 hearings. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcripts (Tr.) on September 2, 2019, and on January 22, 2020. \nThe record closed on January 13, 2020.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAdministrative Notice  \n \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning foreign \ninfluence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Somalia and Kenya. \nDepartment Counsel also provided supporting documentation. Applicant did not object to me \ntaking administrative notice of facts concerning Somalia and Kenya, and I granted \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s motion.  \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts: \n \nSomalia \n \n \nIn 2012, Somalia was established as a federal parliamentary republic. The United \nStates recognized the Federal Government of Somalia in January 2013. U.S. foreign \npolicy objectives in Somalia are to promote economic and political stability, promote \ndemocratic reforms, oppose international terrorism, and alleviate humanitarian crisis \ncaused by conflict and poor weather conditions.  \n \n \nThe United States supports the success of the African Union Mission in driving Al-\nShabaab, a terrorist organization, out of strategically important population centers. The \nUnited States provided more than $3 billion in assistance to Somalia from 2006 to present. \nThe United States supports and works closely with Somalia to establish an effective and \nrepresentative security sector including military, police, and justice officials.  \n \n \nThe State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Somalia advising \nU.S. citizens not to travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, and piracy. Violent crime is \ncommon throughout Somalia, and criminals target foreigners. Terrorism is an ongoing \nthreat throughout Somalia. The State Department designated Somali-based Al-Shabaab \nas a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Al-Shabaab has frequently attacked a variety of \ntargets in Somalia with a wide range of weapons and explosives. Al-Shabaab killed more \nthan 100 people after four attacks in 2017. The majority of those killed in the four attacks \nwere soldiers and police officers.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn Somalia, human rights abuses occur primarily because of Al-Shabaab\u2019s lawless \nbehavior. Some government officials have also engaged in rapes, extortions, and \nmurders with impunity. \n \nKenya \n \nKenya is a republic with three branches of government: a president, who is directly \nelected by the people; a bicameral parliament; and a judiciary. After an election which \nwas disputed in Kenya\u2019s Supreme Court, President Kenyatta took office on November 20, \n2017. The United States and Kenya have partnered in counterterrorism efforts. \n \nOn March 29, 2018, the State Department issued a Level 2 Travel Advisory for \nKenya \u201cexercise increased caution\u201d and indicated \u201cdo not travel\u201d to the Kenya-Somalia \nborder and some coastal areas due to terrorism. Violent crime and terrorism occur \nthroughout Kenya and are ongoing threats. Somali-based Al-Shabaab and ISIS operate \nin Kenya. Terrorists have frequently attacked a variety of targets in Kenya utilizing a wide \nrange of weapons and explosives. In 23 attacks in 2017, terrorists killed 80 people. \n \nHuman rights problems continue to occur in Kenya, including corruption, politically-\nmotivated killings, forced disappearances, torture, and harsh prison conditions. Violations \nof privacy, restrictions on freedom of the press and assembly, and violence against \nwomen continue to occur. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He was born in Somalia and graduated from high school \nin 1978. He was ranked as a Major (artillery officer) in the Somalian army and came to \nthe United States in August 1990 for military training. He worked closely with the U.S. \nmilitary for nearly a year when Somalia erupted in civil war. Applicant requested to stay \nin the U.S. and was offered political asylum. He rented an apartment in State A, which \nwas paid by the Somalian government for two years. (Tr. 13-14; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \n \n  \nApplicant was married in 1988 and divorced in 1996. In February 2005, he married \nagain through a religious ceremony, which was recognized in the U.S. after they were \nlegally married in 2012. His spouse is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia. Applicant \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2008. He is a dual citizen of Somalia and the \nU.S. Applicant currently is employed by a county government agency as deputy auditor \nfor public relations. He is applying for a linguist position with a DOD contractor. His \nemployment is contingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 14; GE 1, GE \n2, GE 3) \n \nForeign Influence: \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is approximately 85 years old. At the time the SOR was drafted, \nhis mother was living in Kenya to receive medical treatment since the medical healthcare \nsystem in Somalia was generally nonexistent during that time. At the hearing, Applicant \nstated that his mother is now residing in Somalia. Department Counsel requested I amend \n\n \n4 \n \nthe SOR to reflect the current information, which I did without an objection. Applicant\u2019s \nmother is a citizen and resident of Somalia. He communicates with his mother \napproximately twice weekly. He also sends her approximately $400 every month. His \ndeceased father was employed by the Somalian government in the postal service. (Tr. \n15, 21-24; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \n  \n \nOne of his brothers is also a citizen and resident of Somalia. Applicant does not \ncommunicate regularly with him. His brother is currently residing with his mother. A niece \nand her five children also live with his mother. The house contains approximately eight \nbedrooms that can accommodate the family. The house is valued at approximately \n$140,000, and Applicant would inherit one-fourth of this property upon her death.  \nApplicant communicates frequently with his niece. His youngest brother remains in Kenya \nand continues to receive treatment for mental health issues. Applicant communicates with \nthis brother every couple of days. (Tr. 15-17, 24-27; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant has three nephews who are citizens and residents of Somalia. One of \nhis nephews is employed by the Canadian government in the capital of Somalia, working \nwith the United Nations. At the time of Applicant\u2019s background interview, this nephew had \nbeen previously employed as a consultant for the President of Somalia in the presidential \npalace. Applicant communicates with this nephew on a monthly basis. Applicant\u2019s second \nnephew is currently employed by the Minister of Finance in Somalia. His third nephew, \nalso living in Somalia, is currently unemployed. The third nephew has requested Applicant \nsend him money on occasion. Applicant sends him $50 to $100 whenever he can afford \nit. (Tr. 18, 28-32; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that an acquaintance of his, who had served with him in the \nSomalian army, was also the Defense Minister of Somalia from 2015 to 2017. He stated \nthat this acquaintance currently resides in the same city as Applicant, but he has not \nspoken to his colleague since 2016. (Tr. 17-19, Tr. 1/2020 7-9) \n \n \nApplicant also admitted that the current Minister of Foreign Affairs in Somalia \nattended middle school with him. Applicant met with him during a visit he had to \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. city of residence. In February 2018, Applicant organized a meeting with \nthe Somalian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Somalian Community Association in his \ncity. Since that meeting, Applicant has not had further contact with him. (Tr. 1/2020 10-\n11; GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that in 1984, while he served in the Somalian army, he \npurchased three properties in Somalia worth an approximate combined value of \n$120,000.  He is uncertain if anything has been built on his properties, and he would like \nto sell them at some point. Applicant does not own a home in the U.S., nor does he have \nany future retirement accounts in the U.S. His only asset in the U.S. is an apartment \nbuilding he purchased during an auction in 2010. The apartment building is currently \nunoccupied, but he would like to rent the apartments out someday. He estimated the \ncurrent value of the apartment building at approximately $100,000. (Tr. 1/2020 11-13; GE \n3) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant stated during a background interview that he would like to retire in \nSomalia within the next ten years, but only if the political party and the government of \nSomalia resolved their conflict. During the hearing, Applicant admitted he would retire in \nSomalia, especially if he generated enough income from his apartment building in the \nU.S. He would also return to Somalia if he were offered a Somalian government position, \nperhaps in the capacity of rebuilding the Somalian army. (Tr. 1/2020 14-17; GE 2, GE 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security \nconcerns, and the following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \n \nThere is a threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights violations in Somalia and \nKenya. Applicant has ongoing familial connections with his mother, niece, nephews, and \nhis brother. He has a substantial property interest in Somalia he values at about $120,000. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \n\n \n7 \n \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, through his family \nmembers. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \n \n \nThe conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States. The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must \nbe made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly.  \n \n \nThere are widely-documented safety issues for residents of Somalia because of \nterrorists and insurgents. The mere possession of close family ties with one or more family \nmembers living in Somalia is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B; \nhowever, if an applicant has a close relationship with even one relative living in a foreign \ncountry, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See Generally ISCR Case \nNo. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, the government ignores the rule of law including widely accepted civil \nliberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the \n\n \n8 \n \ngovernment is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorists cause a substantial amount of \ndeath or property damage, or the country is known to conduct intelligence collection \noperations against the United States. The relationship of Somalia with the United States, \nand the situation in Somalia places a significant, but not insurmountable burden of \npersuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship with his family living in \nSomalia does not pose a security risk.  \n \n \nSome of Applicant\u2019s family members and foreign contacts are, or recently have \nbeen, employed by the Somalian government. The instability and risk of terrorism in \nSomalia present an unacceptable risk that Applicant may be placed in a position of having \nto choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, or government and the \ninterests of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the United States are not substantial. His interest in real property \nin Somalia is worth more than the real property interest he has in the U.S. Applicant \nmaintains close relationships with his mother, niece, and nephews in Somalia, to whom \nhe is bound by affection or obligation. He maintains regular communication with his family \nmembers, to include providing funds to them as needed. This is commendable, but \ndemonstrates that the contacts and relationships are neither casual nor infrequent. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) are not applicable in this case.  \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \n \n \nThere are no allegations of any misconduct by Applicant or that his family members \nare criminals or terrorists. He does, however, continue to have close connections to \nSomalia through numerous family members and his Somalian property interests. He \n\n \n9 \n \nprovided insufficient evidence that the resulting potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress is diminished at present.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns at issue. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security of the United \nStates to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 45-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor, employed since 1997. He was laid off for three months in 2016, and four months in 2017. He previously held a DOD security clearance from 2007 to 2009. Applicant was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1997. He married in 2001 and has two children. Applicant\u2019s spouse was laid off in November 2008 and remained unemployed for nine months. This resulted in a significant decrease in household income during the period. In 2011, Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with dementia. He is her only child. She moved in with Applicant\u2019s family, and Applicant hired a private caregiver for her while he and his spouse were at work or at the children\u2019s events, costing about $800 per month. He eventually was able to place his mother in a nursing home, and continues to pay $1,800 per month to subsidize her costs since February 2019. In August 2017, Applicant\u2019s home was severely damaged by flooding during a hurricane. The damage was not covered by insurance, but the federal government assisted with partial repair costs. Applicant paid an additional $30,000 for repairs. The SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant has 14 delinquent consumer and tax debts totaling about $18,700 and federal income tax debts for tax years 2012 to 2016 totaling about $24,300; and failing to file his 2012 to 2017 federal income tax returns when due.

Jewell, Esq. \n \n \n01/06/2020 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCERVI, Gregg A., Administrative Judge \n \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a questionnaire for national security positions (SF-86) on May \n30, 2017. Applicant is requesting a trustworthiness determination for access to sensitive \ninformation, also known as a \u201cpublic trust\u201d determination, to occupy an automated data \nprocessing (ADP) position. On December 5, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \non June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 28, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a \n\n \n2 \n \nnotice of hearing on August 20, 2019, for a scheduled hearing on September 12, 2019. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified at the hearing and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough T, contained in a tabbed binder, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit any documentary evidence \nin mitigation by September 30, 2019. He submitted several additional documents \ncollectively marked as AE U, which were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript on September 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old systems engineer for a defense contractor, employed \nsince 1997. He was laid off for three months in 2016, and four months in 2017. He \npreviously held a DOD security clearance from 2007 to 2009. Applicant was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1997. He married in 2001 and has two children.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was laid off in November 2008 and remained unemployed for \nnine months. This resulted in a significant decrease in household income during the \nperiod. In 2011, Applicant\u2019s mother was diagnosed with dementia. He is her only child. \nShe moved in with Applicant\u2019s family, and Applicant hired a private caregiver for her while \nhe and his spouse were at work or at the children\u2019s events, costing about $800 per month. \nHe eventually was able to place his mother in a nursing home, and continues to pay \n$1,800 per month to subsidize her costs since February 2019. In August 2017, Applicant\u2019s \nhome was severely damaged by flooding during a hurricane. The damage was not \ncovered by insurance, but the federal government assisted with partial repair costs. \nApplicant paid an additional $30,000 for repairs. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant has 14 delinquent consumer \nand tax debts totaling about $18,700 and federal income tax debts for tax years 2012 to \n2016 totaling about $24,300; and failing to file his 2012 to 2017 federal income tax returns \nwhen due. Additionally, the SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant failed to report \nhis federal income tax debts and failed to file his federal 2016 tax return, when he \ncompleted his SF-86 on May 30, 2017. Applicant generally admitted the SOR allegations \nwith explanations and corrections, and denied intentionally falsifying his SF-86. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a delinquent auto loan for a vehicle to which Applicant had two engine \nreplacements. Applicant allowed the vehicle to be voluntarily repossessed. The creditor \ncharged off the debt in 2015. Applicant negotiated a settlement on the debt in February \n2019, and paid the agreed amount in full. The debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a delinquent apartment rent debt from 2016. Applicant negotiated a \npayment schedule, beginning in February 2019. He has made consistent monthly \npayments since February 2019 per the agreement. This debt is being resolved. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a delinquent apartment debt from 2017. Applicant paid the debt in full \nin February 2019. This debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a small medical account. Applicant incorrectly believed the account \nwas covered by insurance. He paid the account in full, and the debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a delinquent bank debt that became delinquent in 2016. Applicant \nnegotiated a settlement in April 2019 and paid the settlement in full. This debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a phone company collection account. Applicant negotiated a monthly \ninstallment repayment plan in February 2019, and has made scheduled monthly \npayments since March 2019. This debt is being resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a delinquent payday lender account. Applicant paid the account in \nfull in February 2019. The debt is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i are delinquent telephone utility and insurance company \naccounts that were paid in full in February and March 2019. These debts are resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \u2013 1.n are federal income tax debts from tax years 2012 to 2016. \nApplicant was unable to completely pay taxes that were due as a result of the increased \nhousehold expenses for caring for his mother. He established a repayment plan with the \nIRS beginning in 2013, but missed a payment in May 2017, causing the plan to be \nsuspended. Once he restarted payments in June 2017, the plan was reinstated. His \nsubsequent taxes owed were included in the plan, and Applicant has been compliant with \nthe terms of the plan. A substantial refund owed to Applicant for his tax year 2017 filing \nwas applied to the tax debt. These debts are being resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o alleges Applicant failed to file his federal tax returns for 2012 to 2017 \nwhen due, however, Applicant showed evidence that the returns were filed on time. This \nallegation is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant falsified his SF-86. Applicant did not report his federal \ntax debts on his SF-86 because he was in an approved repayment plan with the IRS and \nbelieved that the tax debts were no longer considered delinquent. Additionally, he \nprovided evidence that his federal tax returns were submitted on time, as required. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s resolved debts no longer appear on his most recent credit report. \nApplicant and his spouse now have a combined annual household income of $135,000, \nand he has over $12,000 in retirement and savings accounts. They adhere to a strict \nbudget, and his personal financial statement shows a substantial monthly net remainder. \nHe has not had financial counseling, but through the assistance of his counsel, has \nensured that all SOR debts have been resolved or are in the process of resolution. \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. DOD contractor personnel are \nentitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n5 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c) and (f). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant incurred debts that were beyond his control, and he took sufficient steps \nto resolve the delinquent accounts. He suffered from various periods of reduced income \nfrom his and his spouse\u2019s periods of unemployment, and added expenses from \nrecovering from a hurricane and caring for his mother. Once Applicant had sufficient \nresources, he addressed his delinquent accounts and resolved all of the SOR allegations. \nHe has been working with the IRS on tax obligations since 2013, and is in compliance \n\n \n6 \n \nwith his tax repayment plan. He also filed his annual federal income tax returns on time, \nas required. \n \nApplicant has taken responsible action to address his debts. Applicant has \nreceived advice from his attorney and has worked to correct his financial record. There \nare clear indications that his financial problems are resolved or being resolved, and his \nfinancial status is under control. I find that continued financial delinquencies are unlikely \nto recur and his financial status does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. Mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(d), and 20(g) \napply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n  \nThe trustworthiness concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nWhen falsification allegations are controverted, as here, the Government has the \nburden of proving the allegations. An omission, standing alone, does not prove \nfalsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to \ndetermine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. (See ISCR Case No. \n03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004)) An applicant\u2019s level of education and business \nexperience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. (ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. \nSep. 9, 2010)) \n \n  \nApplicant did not report his federal tax debts on his SF-86 because he was in an \napproved repayment plan with the IRS and believed that the tax debts were no longer \nconsidered delinquent. Additionally, he provided evidence that his federal tax returns \nwere submitted on time, as required. He denied intentionally falsifying his SF-86, and \nsatisfactorily explained the circumstances. I find that based on Applicant\u2019s answer and \ntestimony, his failure to report the SOR debts on his SF-86 was not intentional. He \n\n \n7 \n \nprovided plausible explanations for his omissions, and intentional falsification is not \nsupported by the evidence. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a. The personal \nconduct security concern is concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E, in my whole-person analysis. I believe \nApplicant adequately explained his financial situation, and despite the debts incurred as \na result of the loss of household income, the costs of caring for his mother, and uninsured \nhurricane damage to his home, he took responsible action to resolve the delinquent debts. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n         Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:    \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2. Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  Subparagraphs 2.a: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information \nis granted. \n   _______________________ \nGregg A. Cervi \nAdministrative Judge \n",

However, \nhe did not mitigate personal conduct security concerns due to falsifications on security \nclearance applications. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 17, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign \ninfluence) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. I was assigned the \ncase on January 6, 2020. A notice of hearing dated January 29, 2020, scheduled the \nhearing for February 13, 2020. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The \nGovernment introduced seven documents, which were admitted into evidence as Exhibits \n\n \n2 \n \n(GX) 1-7 without objection. Applicant testified and offered eight documents, accepted \nwithout objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A-H. The transcript was received on \nFebruary 24, 2020. Based on a review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The request and the attached \nsource documents were admitted into evidence as GX 7. All of the documents referenced \nin the Request for Administrative Notice and the facts asserted therein are from open \nsources and are dated. Pakistan has been plagued by corruption and human rights \nproblems. The country has experienced numerous recent terrorist attacks. Terrorists have \ntargeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past. The U.S. Government has \nlimited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the \nsecurity environment.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to reconsider or avoid \ntravel to Pakistan in certain areas due to terrorism and outbreaks of violence.  \n \nApplicant posed no objection to the request. I have taken administrative notice of \nthe facts contained in the source documents in GX 7 and incorporated them by reference. \nThe facts are summarized in the written request and will not be repeated here.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old senior software engineer who was born and educated in \nPakistan. He received his undergraduate degree in Pakistan. He came to the United \nStates in June 2002 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. (GX 4) His Pakistani \ncitizenship was revoked. He has four children who are U.S. citizens. His wife is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 15) He has held a security clearance since 2012. He has \nworked on various Government projects and he has worked in support of the U.S. military \nin the United States and abroad. (Tr. 20) Applicant submitted his most recent security \nclearance application on June 5, 2017. (GX 1) He also submitted SCAs in 2013, 2014, \nand 2015. (GX 2, 3, and 4) \n \n \nThe sole Guideline B allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.a) concerns Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law \nand father-in law, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Under Guideline E, the SOR \nalleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearances in 2015, 2014, \n2013, and in background interviews in 2016 and 2011, by failing to disclose his brother \nas a relative. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.e). Applicant\u2019s brother has been in a U.S. prison since 2005. \nThe SOR alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.f that Applicant resigned from his employment after being \ntold that he would be fired in 2013. Applicant denied all allegations of falsification under \nGuideline E. (Answer)  \n \n \n   Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a., concerning his in-laws in Pakistan. He stated that \nhe has minimal telephone contact with them, about two or three times a year.  Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \nwife talks to her parents by phone about every few months. Her mother is a housewife \nand her father is retired. (Tr. 29) Applicant stated that he does not know much about them. \nHe met his wife\u2019s parents in Pakistan in 2010 when he married his wife. Their marriage \nwas pre-arranged. His in-laws have never been to the United States. They do not know \nthe nature of Applicant\u2019s work. He considers them \u201cold and aged\u201d and simple people who \nhave no connection with the government. (Tr. 31; GX 5) Applicant does not give them \nfinancial support. \n \n \nApplicant has five siblings: four brothers and one sister. They reside in the United \nStates and are naturalized U.S. citizens. (Tr. 27) One of his brothers has been in a U.S. \nprison since 2005. (GX 6) In Section 18 of the SCAs that he prepared in 2013, 2014, and \n2015. Applicant listed his siblings, but he did not list the brother in prison. \n \n \n Applicant stated that he was advised by his first employer that he did not have to \nlist the brother in prison because Applicant had minimal contact with him and Applicant \ndoes not like to speak about his past. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant stated that he relied on that \nadvice and when he completed subsequent security clearance questionnaires, he did not \nchange any answers to disclose his brother in prison. (Tr. 34)  \n \n \nDuring a 2016 subject interview when asked if he had any other family members \nto list, Applicant said \u201cNo.\u201d When asked directly by the interviewer if he had a brother in \nprison, Applicant responded in the negative again. (GX 5) In his 2011 subject interview, \nhe confirmed that no other relatives needed to be listed. (GX 5) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he takes his mother to visit his brother in \nprison about twice a year. (Tr. 57) He acknowledged that he sees his brother on these \nvisits. Applicant\u2019s mother lives with Applicant and his family. Applicant\u2019s brother calls from \nprison to speak to her mother, and sometimes Applicant will answer the phone and speak \nto him.  (Tr. 58)  \n \n \nHowever, when Applicant answered the SOR, he stated that his estranged \nrelationship with his brother is unspoken because it would be unfair if it were to negatively \nimpact Applicant\u2019s life. (Answer) He added that he \u201cfalsely\u201d believed that this disclosure \nof his brother in prison would negatively impact his ability to obtain a clearance. Applicant \nstated that his intent was not to defraud the U.S. Government.  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his brother in prison on his 2017 SCA. Applicant acknowledged \nthat the omission of his brother\u2019s details looks like a deliberate failure to disclose material \nfacts. Applicant testified that he has received counseling and stressed that since 2017, \nhe has disclosed his brother in prison during the clearance application process. He said \none of his other brothers advised him to disclose that he had a brother in prison. (Tr. 62) \n \n \nThe final SOR allegation, \u00b6 2.f, concerns Applicant\u2019s resignation in 2013 from a job \nbefore being fired for issuing an unauthorized badge to someone at work. Applicant \nexplained at his hearing that the issue resulted from a personality conflict. (Tr. 67-69)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant submitted five letters of recommendation from various personal friends \nand professional colleagues. Each letter attests to Applicant\u2019s integrity, positivity, \nresponsibility, and reliability. He is described as a valuable asset to any team. Military \nofficers for whom Applicant worked stated that he was a dedicated and respectful \nemployee. (AX A \u2013 E) Applicant also submitted an entry on duty (EOD), dated January \n2020 for approval for work with another government agency. (AX F, H) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the \nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain classified \nor sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s foreign \ncontacts may create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and through \nhis family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \nand  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States. As the DOHA Appeal Board held \nin ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004):  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not \nauthorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, \norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States. \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant came to the United States in 2002. He became a U.S. citizen in 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws in Pakistan are retired. They have never visited the United States. \nApplicant has little contact with them. His wife only occasionally communicates with her \nparents by telephone. Applicant\u2019s wife and children are U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s siblings \nreside in the United States. His mother also lives with him. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members are U.S. citizens. He has longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties here. He worked for various contractors and for the military \nabroad for many years. He has been described as a solid citizen. His in-laws are citizens \nand residents of Pakistan, but the contact is minimal. There is no indication that they are \naffiliated with the Pakistani government or intelligence services. His family does not know \nthe particulars of his work. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) apply to mitigate the Guideline B \nsecurity concern regarding Applicant\u2019s in-laws in Pakistan.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \n\n \n8 \n \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior. \n \n \nApplicant prepared SCAs in 2013, 2014, and 2015. In disclosing his family \nmembers in response to Section 18 on those SCAs, he repeatedly omitted one of his \nbrothers, who has been in prison since 2005. He did not list this brother on an SCA until \nhis most recent application, in 2017.  \n \n \nIn answering the SOR allegations, Applicant stated that he \u201cfalsely\u201d believed that \ntalking about his imprisoned brother could have a negative impact on his ability to have a \nsecurity clearance. He also testified that he did not answer the various security clearance \nquestions with a deliberate intention to deceive the Government. Earlier, he stated that \nhe received advice from a prior employer, who stated that Applicant did not have to list \nthe brother in prison because Applicant did not have contact with him. However, Applicant \ntestified that he has had contact with this brother by phone when the brother calls his \nmother from prison. He also has visited the brother in prison, with his mother. The \nquestion on the SCA was straight-forward and clear as to listing siblings. Applicant \nactively chose not to list the brother in prison on multiple SCAs. His various explanations \nfor his repeated omissions are not credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies.  \n \n \nDuring a 2016 subject interview when asked if he had any other family members \nto disclose, Applicant said \u201cNo.\u201d When asked directly by the interviewer if he had a brother \nin prison, Applicant responded in the negative again. This was a lie. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies \nto Applicant\u2019s falsifications during his background interviews.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.f concerns Applicant\u2019s resignation in 2013 from a job before being fired \nfor issuing an unauthorized badge to someone at work. Applicant explained during his \nhearing testimony that the issue resulted from a personality conflict. I found Applicant\u2019s \nexplanation of the circumstances credible. AG \u00b6 16(d) does not apply. I find for Applicant \non this allegation. \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate personal conduct security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n9 \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined above, I find the following. \nApplicant did not list his brother in prison on an SCA until 2017. This was after submitting \nmultiple previous SCAs without disclosing this brother, and after a 2016 background \ninterview in which Applicant deliberately lied about his brother in prison, including once \nhe was confronted by the interviewing agent. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant explained that he initially failed to disclose his brother in prison because \nhis employer told him he did not have to disclose the brother if Applicant had no contact \nwith him. Applicant did, in fact, have contact with his brother in prison, and he repeatedly \nfailed to disclose that brother on later SCAs, until 2017. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nThe repeated nature of Applicant\u2019s falsifications about his brother in prison \npreclude application of AG \u00b6 17(c). The fact that Applicant referenced counseling in his \nhearing testimony and listed his brother in prison on his most recent SCA, in 2017, is not \nsufficient evidence to establish that his behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not \napply. Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct security concerns. \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n\n \n10 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has mitigated foreign \ninfluence, but he has not mitigated personal conduct security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:                       AGAINST APPLICANT  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-e:                             Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n              Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Item 5.) On January 9, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \n(Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant signed her Answer to the SOR (Answer) on March 20, 2019, and \nrequested her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

It consists of summaries of unsworn interviews of Applicant \nconducted by various interviewers from the Office of Personnel Management on January \n10, 2005; January 18, 2011; June 22, 2017; and February 23, 2018.

(See Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 15 is \nalso cumulative. Applicant is not legally trained and might not have understood \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM commentary, which described the potential admissibility of \nItem 15. I therefor reviewed it for any potentially mitigating information that Applicant \nmight have thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will be \ndiscussed later in this decision. \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she has failed to meet her financial obligations and is therefore potentially \nunreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with the exception of subparagraph 1.e, which \nshe denied. The total amount of money Applicant is alleged to owe in past-due debts is \napproximately $22,300. \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a and 1.b, which concern Applicant\u2019s 2014, \n2015, 2016, and 2017 Federal and state income tax returns. Applicant admitted that she \nhad not filed any of those tax returns in a timely fashion. In Section 26 of Item 5, which \nconcerns Applicant\u2019s financial situation, she stated that her 2014 returns had not been \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nfiled because, \u201cI was unemployed at the time and I did not know I needed to do my taxes \nfor 2014 until I filed for 2015.\u201d She further stated that, \u201cI am in the process of gathering \nthe information I need from my unemployment agency to take back to H&R Block to have \nthem do my taxes for 2014.\u201d (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant also responded to interrogatories propounded on her by DOHA. In her \nresponse, dated December 19, 2018, she again admitted not filing state or Federal tax \nreturns for tax years, 2014 through 2017. For 2014 and 2015 she stated, \u201cI was \nunemployed.\u201d For years 2016 and 2017 she stated, \u201cI was unable to pay the price to get \nthem done due to bills accumulating. I still am trying to catch up and make payments. My \nhome foreclosed and I\u2019m currently living in an apartment.\u201d She also submitted \ndocumentation from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) confirming the fact that she had \nnot filed her Federal returns. (Item 6 at 6, 38-43.) \n \n \nAllegations 1.c through 1.i concern Applicant\u2019s past-due indebtedness. The current \nstatus of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing $12,232 to a finance company for the balance due \non an automobile that was repossessed. Applicant stated in her interrogatories that she \nwas making payments on this debt. The most recent credit report in the record, dated \nApril 10, 2019, showed the debt as, \u201cRedeemed or reinstated repossession.\u201d In addition, \nthe report stated Applicant, \u201cPays account as agreed.\u201d (Item 6 at 3, 8; Item 7 at 2.) This \ndebt is being resolved through payments. \n \n \n1.d. Applicant admitted owing $2,228 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for a \npast-due debt. Applicant did not supply any information showing that she had paid, or had \nplans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 6 at 3, 20, 21; Item 7 at 4.) This debt \nis not resolved. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant denied owing $365 for a past-due mobile phone bill stating, \u201cIt\u2019s paid \noff.\u201d The most recent credit report in the record states, \u201cAccount paid for less than full \nvalue. Paid collection.\u201d (Item 7 at 3.) This debt is resolved. \n \n  \n1.f. Applicant admitted owing $2,310 to a condominium association for a judgment \nentered against her in 2015 for unpaid fees. Applicant no longer lives at the property, \nwhich was the subject of a foreclosure action. Applicant did not supply any information \nshowing that she had paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 6 at 4; \nItem 9.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n \n1.g. Applicant admitted owing $2,470 to a condominium association for a second \njudgment entered against her in 2016 for unpaid fees. Applicant no longer lives at the \nproperty, which was the subject of a foreclosure action. Applicant did not supply any \ninformation showing that she had paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; \nItem 6 at 4; Item 10.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \n1.h. Applicant admitted owing $165.82 to a city treasurer\u2019s office for a judgment \nentered against her in 2016. Applicant submitted no information showing that she had \npaid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 11.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n \n1.i. Applicant admitted owing $2,470 to a condominium association for a judgment \nentered against her in 2017 for unpaid fees. Applicant no longer lives at the property, \nwhich was the subject of a foreclosure action. Applicant did not supply any information \nshowing that she had paid, or plans to pay, this debt. (Item 5 at Section 26; Item 6 at 4; \nItem 12.) This debt is not resolved. \n \n \nApplicant submitted no documented financial information, such as a budget, from \nwhich to make a conclusion that she is now financially stable. Applicant did not submit \nany evidence concerning the quality of her job performance. She submitted no character \nreferences or other evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or \nreliability. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person since \nshe elected to have her case decided without a hearing. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to file Federal or state income tax returns, as required, for tax years \n2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. In addition, she owes past-due consumer debts. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \n \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s substantial financial issues, including failure to \ntimely file tax returns and unpaid bills: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant has not filed her state or Federal tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, \n2016, and 2017. She submitted no information concerning when she plans to file those \nreturns. Mitigating condition 1(g) does not apply. Allegations 1.a and 1.b are found against \nApplicant. \n \nApplicant submitted no evidence that the debts in allegations 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i \nhave been, or will be, resolved. Applicant did not supply any information to support a \nfinding that her financial problems were beyond her control, or that she had acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She admitted each debt. I have considered the fact \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nthat Applicant was unemployed for several months after leaving the Navy. However, she \ncontinues to owe approximately $9,700 in past-due debts that she has not paid, or made \nany plans to pay. AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) do not apply to those debts. Allegations \n1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i, are found against Applicant. \n \nApplicant submitted documentation to show that the debts in allegations 1.c and \n1.e are either paid or being resolved. Those two allegations are found for Applicant. With \nthose exceptions, Applicant did not mitigate her financial issues. Guideline F is found \nagainst Applicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to show that her debts were being resolved. The potential for pressure, \nexploitation, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the evidence creates substantial \ndoubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for national security eligibility. She failed \nto meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nfinancial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n    AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f through 1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

DOHA received \nthe transcript 1 April 2019, and the record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations. She is a 34-year-old senior software \nengineer employed by a defense contractor since December 2012. She seeks to retain \nthe clearance she was first issued in April 2009 (GE 1). \nApplicant used several illegal drugs from about April 2004 to at least March 2015, \na fact she disclosed on her June 2016 clearance application (SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.c.) (GE 1). \nAt the time, she stated that she used cocaine or crack cocaine and stimulants3 about \ntwice a year between October 2008 and March 2015, when she got together with a long-\ndistance friend, who provided the drugs; she also stated that she used marijuana about \neight times per year with a long-distance friend who provided it, or with a sibling. Applicant \nstated that her marijuana use during this period was with her sisters when she was home \non family visits. She used the marijuana to be sociable \nDuring an October 2017 interview with a Government investigator (GE 2), she \nclarified that her cocaine and ecstasy use occurred at social gatherings, clubs, or raves. \nWhile she named the individual who provided the drugs, she also made it clear that the \ndrug use was with a larger circle of friends. She stated that she used the drugs out of \nsocial pressure, but stopped because she realized that she was risking her job and her \nclearance. She acknowledged using these drugs at two different employers, while cleared \n(SOR 1.e.), and knew that there was a no-tolerance drug policy at one of them. Applicant \nalso disclosed that she was arrested in June 2010 and charged with marijuana \npossession (SOR 1.d.), but was tried and acquitted in January 2011 (AE F). \nHowever, Applicant was also interviewed by a Government investigator in \nFebruary 2009, as part of an earlier background investigation (GE 2). She described using \necstasy once in April 2004, using cocaine twiceConce in April 2007 and once in May \n2008, using psychedelic mushrooms once in July 2007, and using cannabis about 88 \ntimes between June 2004 and June 2008. She used cannabis with her siblings and \nothers. She stated that she bought cannabis about one-third of the times she used, and \nsometimes gave away or sold the drug to friends. She stated that she would not use \ncannabis again because of the risks to her job and clearance. \nApplicant executed a statement of intent regarding future drug use as \ncontemplated by the Directive (Answer, AE F). She underwent a drug screen in March \n2019 that tested negative for six categories of illegal drugs (AE F). \nApplicant acknowledged that her poor decisions reflect adversely on her judgment, \nbut attributes them to her youth, some traumatic life experiences, and peer pressure. \n3Amphetamines, speed, crystal meth-amphetamines, ecstasy, etc. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, she notes that she no longer associates with the friend who previously supplied \nthe drugs when they got together, and she has sharply reduced the number of times per \nyear that she returns home for family events. And she absents herself from the gathering \nif any of her siblings produce marijuana. \nApplicant=s character referencesCa coworker and social acquaintance, her uncle, \na long-time friend and former coworker, and an intermittent boyfriend (AE G)Cconsider \nher honest and trustworthy, and recommend her for her security clearance. None of them \nhas seen any indication of illegal drug use, although they have seen the SOR allegations. \nPolicies \nThe AG list factors to evaluate a person=s suitability for access to classified \ninformation. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. Each decision must \nalso show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the factors listed in AG & \n2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. \nHowever, specific guidelines should be followed when a case can be measured against \nthem, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a clearance. \nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative \nguidelines are Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant=s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government=s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe Aclearly consistent with the national interest@ standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant=s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline H, by \ndemonstrating Applicant=s illegal drug abuse between April 2004 and March 2015, and \nher illegal drug use after being granted a clearance in April 2009.5 However, Applicant \n4See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 &25(a) any substance misuse; (c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase. . .; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigated the security concerns. Applicant used illegal drugs in social settings for about \n11 years, including for about six years after she was granted a clearance. Nevertheless, \nshe has not used any illegal drugs for four years. \nDrug involvement mitigating conditions give significant support to Applicant. Her \nillegal drug abuse was not recent, not frequent, and occurred under circumstances \nunlikely to recur.6 Applicant has distanced herself from friends and family with whom she \nused drugs. She has learned to walk away from family gatherings if illegal drugs are \nintroduced. She has used no illegal drugs for four years. Finally, she has executed a \nstatement of intent regarding future illegal drug use as contemplated by the guidelines.7 \nUnder the circumstances, I conclude Applicant is unlikely to abuse illegal drugs in the \nfuture. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H for Applicant. \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J, but \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant was acquitted of the June 2010 drug \npossession charge, and the Applicant=s social use of cocaine, ecstasy, and marijuana \nlack security significance even under a disqualifying condition which contemplates a \npattern of minor misconduct. None of the drug use resulted in charges, and it is a stretch \nto consider the drug use a course of criminal conduct.

He denied, and attempted to conceal, his financial \nissues when applying for a trustworthiness determination. Based upon evaluation of the \ntestimony, pleadings, and exhibits, national security eligibility to occupy a designated \nsensitive position is denied.   \n  \nHistory of Case \n \nOn May 12, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On March 5, 2019, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 10, 2019 (Answer), and requested \na decision based on the administrative record, without a hearing before an administrative \njudge. On June 3, 2019, the Government elected to request a hearing pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.7. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the \ncase to me on June 6, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 8, 2019, setting \nthe hearing for September 11, 2019. A continuance of the hearing date until November \n6, 2019, was granted to the Government due to an unforeseeable circumstance. On that \ndate, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 into evidence. \nApplicant testified, and offered Exhibits (AE) A through I into evidence. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until \nNovember 20, 2019, to permit submission of additional evidence. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on November 19, 2019. Applicant timely submitted additional \nevidence, which was marked and admitted into evidence as AE J and AE K, without \nobjection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 56 years old, and has four adult children. He and his first wife divorced \nin February 2014, after almost 25 years of marriage. He remarried in December 2016. He \nearned a high school diploma in 1983, a licensed practical nurse (LPN) diploma in 1992, \nand an online associate\u2019s degree in 2014. He first enlisted in the National Guard in 1984, \nand retired from the U.S. Army with an honorable discharge in December 2006 as a staff \nsergeant (pay grade E-6). He held a Secret clearance during most of his enlisted service. \nHe began his current employment as a medical training project lead with a major defense \nservices contractor in March 2015, and applied for a trustworthiness determination in \nconnection with that position. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE J; Tr. 7, 39, 54-57.) \n \n \nFollowing his retirement from the Army, Applicant worked as a civilian federal (GS) \nemployee at a major military hospital from April 2007 to October 2008, from April 2009 to \nNovember 2014, and again from June 2015 to May 2016. From November 2008 to April \n2009 he worked at the same hospital as a medical trainer but was employed by a defense \ncontractor. Applicant voluntarily left his GS position in November 2014 under unfavorable \ncircumstances after some workplace incidents. After being rehired in June 2015, he was \nfired by the hospital in May 2016 for missing too many days of work without justification. \nHe was unemployed from February to June 2015, taking \u201ctime off\u201d after his previous \ncontract position ended; and again from May 2016 to September 2016, after being fired \nfrom his GS hospital job. He reported that during both brief unemployment periods he, \n\u201cwas supported financially from his military disability pay and military retirement \u2026 [and \nhe] had no problems from not working.\u201d (GE 1; GE 3; Tr. 57.)  \n \n \nApplicant largely attributed the absenteeism that led to his May 2016 dismissal, as \nwell as his financial mismanagement and memory problems, to some unspecified service-\nrelated injuries and a more recent head injury he received on July 4, 2015. One of the \nguests at a neighborhood family barbecue party that Applicant hosted that evening struck \nhim with a beer bottle as he intervened in an alcohol-fueled altercation. Applicant provided \ndocumentation showing that his assailant was convicted of Malicious Mischief in the First \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nDegree and Assault in the Fourth Degree on April 29, 2016, after she pled guilty for her \npart in the altercation. During the evening of July 7, 2015, Applicant went to the \nemergency room at the military hospital, where he had just resumed working, complaining \nof headaches from this incident. He was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome and \nlacerations to his face, and received pain medications. (Answer; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE \nH; Tr. 58-63, 75-76.)  \n \n \nAs alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant falsely responded, \u201cNo,\u201d to the question in \nSection 26 of his May 12, 2017 e-QIP, which asked whether he had any delinquencies \ninvolving routine financial accounts during the past seven years. In fact, he had six \ndelinquent personal loans or credit card accounts, as described in detail below, which \nexceeded $90,000. (GE 1; GE 4; GE 8.) \n \n \nAbout five weeks later, on June 20, 2017, Applicant completed, certified as true, \nand filed a federal court petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief. (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) All six of \nthe delinquencies alleged in the SOR were listed on Schedule E/F of that petition, which \nincluded a total of $124,964 in nonpriority unsecured debts. Schedules I and J of the \npetition declared that his monthly income and expenses were, respectively, $6,388 and \n$5,537; yielding a monthly net income of $851. Applicant changed his mind about making \nthe payments necessary to obtain bankruptcy relief, and his case was dismissed on \nSeptember 19, 2017. (Answer; GE 3; GE 8; AE A; AE D; Tr. 77-78.) \n \n \nOn December 1, 2017, Applicant enrolled in a debt resolution program (DRP) with \na national for-profit debt-relief company to address his delinquencies. He testified that he \nmakes fixed monthly payments of $1,543 to this company under his DRP, for their use in \nnegotiating and paying settlements of his delinquencies. He implied, but did not \ndocument, that he made all of those payments. At that rate he would have paid $37,032 \nthrough November 2019 to the company. His September 2019 Program Summary from \nthe company shows an account balance of $910 and, as detailed below, the company \nreported total payments of $7,504 toward his delinquent accounts. There is no information \nconcerning the $28,618 difference between the $37,032 paid into the DRP and the $8,414 \npaid out or retained for future payments by the company. (GE 3; AE A; AE I.; Tr. 83.) \n \n \nAn investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant on April 12, 2018. The interview was \nconducted, by mutual agreement, in the dining area of a public coffee house. Applicant \nsaid that this arrangement made it uncomfortable for him to discuss derogatory personal \ninformation and that the interviewer seemed somewhat accusatory and unprofessional. \n(Answer; Tr. 36-39.) He later reviewed the interviewer\u2019s summary of the PSI and provided \nsome corrected information. (GE 3.)  \n \n \nApplicant told the interviewer supplemental information to update many of his e-\nQIP answers concerning his contact information, his education, his employment and \nmilitary histories, and his family members. When the issue of his financial considerations \nwas discussed, he first told the interviewer that he had begun credit counseling and debt \nconsolidation through his DRP, and was paying them $1,500 per month for their use in \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nresolving his personal loans and credit card debts. He then, reportedly, \u201cconfirms that he \nhas no delinquent accounts that should have been reported on the case papers and the \naccounts being handled by [the DRP] would not pertain to the financial questions asked.\u201d \n(GE 3 at 4-8.)    \n \n \nThe interviewer then confronted Applicant with information from his credit bureau \nreport (CBR) concerning eight delinquent debts, including the six that were subsequently \nalleged in the SOR. He said that one small collection account had been fully repaid in \n2017, and that the other seven were being handled in his DRP. He acknowledged and \nexplained details concerning each of these eight delinquent debts to the interviewer, and \nsaid each one was not listed on his e-QIP, \u201cdue to oversight,\u201d when asked about them \nindividually. After discussing his dismissed bankruptcy petition with the interviewer, he \ntold her that he:  \n \nstopped making payments on all the above accounts when he thought he\u2019d \nfile for bankruptcy which was in early 2017 which is why the accounts \nbecame delinquent and some were sent to collections for non-payment. \n[He] thought it would all be resolved with the bankruptcy however he then \ndecided not to file. [He] did not list each account on the case papers due to \noversight and agrees with all the confronted information. \n  \n(GE 3 at 8-10.) \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he was unaware of delinquent \ndebts when he completed his e-QIP because he thought all of his bills were being \nautomatically paid by his bank. He claimed that he was not aware of his delinquencies \nuntil they were brought to his attention during the April 2018 interview, then once he \u201chad \nbeen made aware of how bad the situation was [he] took corrective action went to a lawyer \nfiled a Chapter 13.\u201d He said that when he became aware that he would only be able to \nkeep about $400 a month for many years under the Chapter 13 plan he filed to dismiss \nthat, and later entered into his DRP. However, he could not explain during his hearing \nwhy he said he was unaware of his delinquencies until the OPM PSI in April 2018, when \nhe had filed the bankruptcy petition involving those debts shortly after certifying the false \ne-QIP, then entered the DRP to resolve them, both of which took place in 2017 while he \nsaid he did not know they were delinquent. (Answer; Tr. 74-82.)   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant violated a 300-foot restraining order, contained \nin the 2014 Decree of Dissolution of his marriage to his first wife, at least twice during \nFebruary 2016 by accosting her in her place of employment. At the time, they both worked \nat the major military hospital discussed above. There is no record evidence detailing any \nsuch incidents, and Applicant denied that any of their communications during that period \nwere not mutually consensual. Department Counsel introduced a copy of the Decree in \nquestion, which specifically excludes encounters at, \u201ctheir mutual place of work,\u201d from \napplication of the order\u2019s 300-foot restriction. This SOR allegation is without merit. \n(Answer; GE 2; Tr. 89-92.)  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nThe following subparagraphs describe the origin and status of each of Applicant\u2019s \nsix SOR-alleged debts, which totaled $90,482 and became delinquent during 2016 or \nearly 2017. These findings are based on the information contained in Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR; his October 5, 2018 interrogatory response adopting and supplementing the \nreport of his OPM PSI; the record CBRs; Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition; and \nstatus documents from his DRP. (Answer; GE 3 through GE 8; AE I.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Applicant opened this $50,000 unsecured personal loan from \nan online personal finance company in November 2015. His payments became \ndelinquent in December 2016, and the lender charged off the past-due loan \nbalance of $46,375 after his last payment in March 2017. The debt is \u201cenrolled\u201d in \nApplicant\u2019s DRP, with no reported settlement amount. His most recent (May 2019) \nrecord CBR shows no payments and an outstanding balance due of $46,375. This \ndebt is not resolved.   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Applicant opened this $35,000 unsecured personal loan from a \nmajor financial institution in July 2012. His payments became delinquent in March \n2017 and the lender reported charging off the $19,878 past-due balance in \nDecember 2017, after dismissal of his bankruptcy plan. Applicant\u2019s DRP reported \nan agreed settlement amount of $8,675 for this account, with \u201cPayments Pending.\u201d \nThere is no evidence of actual payments having been made to this creditor. This \ndebt is not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: Applicant also opened this $15,000-limit credit card account with \nthe major financial institution in July 2012. He made his last timely payment toward \nthe account in October 2016, and the lender charged off the $16,096 past-due \nbalance in May 2017. Applicant\u2019s DRP reported an agreed settlement amount of \n$7,244 for this debt, and that payments of this amount were complete as of \nSeptember 2019. His May 2019 CBR showed receipt of an unspecified partial \npayment to this account in April 2019, and a past-due balance of $11,896. This \ndebt is probably resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Applicant opened this $5,000-limit credit card account with a \ndifferent bank in May 2015. His payments became delinquent in March 2016 and \nhe made his last payment toward this debt in September 2016. The lender charged \noff the $5,346 past-due balance in late 2017 or early 2018, after dismissal of \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy plan. Although Applicant said during his OPM PSI that this \ndebt was included in, and being actively repaid through, his DRP, that claim was \nincorrect. When asked during the hearing to clarify the situation, he claimed that \nhe had reached out to the bank and was told that he did not have to worry about it \nanymore since it was charged off. He could not recall receiving documentation of \nthis, or an IRS Form 1099-C forgiving this debt. He did not pay any associated \nincome taxes if the debt was forgiven, and did not submit pertinent documentation \nwhile the record remained open after his hearing so he could locate it. (Tr. 70-73; \nAE J; AE K.) This debt is not resolved.         \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Applicant opened this $2,000-limit credit card account with the \nmajor financial institution in October 2015. He made his last timely payment toward \nthe account in September 2016, and it was closed by the lender in January 2017. \nThe $2,331 past-due balance was charged off in October 2017, after dismissal of \nthe bankruptcy plan. The debt is \u201cenrolled\u201d in Applicant\u2019s DRP, with no reported \nsettlement amount. His May 2019 CBR shows no payments and an outstanding \nbalance due of $2,331. This debt is not resolved.    \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: Applicant opened this $300-limit account with a major credit card \ncompany in April 2016. He made his last payment toward the already delinquent \naccount in September 2016, and it was subsequently placed for collection with a \npast-due balance of $456. Applicant\u2019s DRP reported an agreed settlement amount \nof $260 for this $502 debt, and that payments of this amount were complete as of \nMarch 2019. His July 2018 CBR showed receipt of an unspecified partial payment \nby the debt collection agency in satisfaction of this account, and it no longer \nappears on his May 2019 CBR. This debt is resolved.  \n \n \n  An Army major who served with Applicant in various capacities between 2000 \nand 2012, and remains in contact, wrote a letter praising Applicant\u2019s medical knowledge, \ncomposure, leadership, trustworthiness, and professionalism. While on active duty, \nApplicant earned three Meritorious Service Medals, six Army Achievement Medals, six \nArmy Good Conduct Medals, and various expeditionary or service awards. His NCO \nEvaluation Reports for his final three years of service reflected excellent performance in \nvarious capacities at two military hospitals. In November 2012, he was selected to join \nthe Order of Military Medical Merit, in recognition of his many significant contributions to \nthe U.S. Army Medical Department. It is, \u201ca non-profit organization that depends upon \n[the participation of its members] to keep it viable.\u201d (AE J; AE K.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Pursuant to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of information compromise.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant incurred more than $90,000 in delinquent consumer credit indebtedness \nsince 2016, of which more than $85,800 remains unresolved. He claims to have paid \nmore than $37,000 into his DRP, which reportedly paid out $7,504 and is holding a current \nbalance of $910 in his account. The filing and dismissal of Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition in 2017, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, do not raise any disqualifying \nconcerns independent of the underlying debt information or the light these actions shed \non Applicant\u2019s state of mind at the times he subsequently denied being aware of them. \nThose concerns are adequately addressed under other SOR allegations. These facts \nestablish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the \nburden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns.  \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt over the past four years is substantial, and \nhis financial irresponsibility is ongoing. Neither his short-lived bankruptcy filing nor his \nDRP participation addressed the substantial, and otherwise unexplained, SOR-alleged \ndelinquencies in a meaningful way. These debts create ongoing concerns about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. He offered no reasonable basis to conclude that \nhe has corrected his financial practices to preclude the continuation or recurrence of these \nissues. Mitigation was not established under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplicant described some circumstances that might have been beyond his control, \nsuch as his 2014 divorce and his head injury in an altercation at the July 2015 holiday \nbarbecue party he hosted, but he did not demonstrate how these incidents caused him to \nkeep borrowing additional funds on credit or stop paying his previously outstanding and \nnew accounts. Nor did his bankruptcy actions or DRP participation establish that he acted \nresponsibly under such circumstances, as required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nApplicant offered no evidence of effective financial counseling or budget \ninformation establishing solvency going forward, and demonstrated no ability to repay his \ncurrent delinquencies. He failed to demonstrate that his financial problems are being \nresolved, are under control, or that a sensible good-faith effort toward resolution has \nactually been initiated. Accordingly, Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial \nsecurity concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d). \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying under the established facts alleged in the SOR: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant falsified his May 12, 2017 e-QIP when he responded, \u201cNo,\u201d and denied \nthat he had any delinquencies involving his routine financial accounts. His subsequent \ncontradictory explanations for when he knew about these debts and why he denied them \non the e-QIP were not credible, and illustrate his recognition of the significance of his \nfailed attempt to conceal these debts. He held, and regularly renewed, a security \nclearance during most of his 20-year military career in the medical field. I conclude that \nhe deliberately falsified his e-QIP by denying what he knew to be material facts \nconcerning his financial issues. This evidence establishes substantial trustworthiness \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 includes four conditions that could mitigate the trustworthiness concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s personal conduct: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirements to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that would support mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions. He denied having reportable delinquencies during his OPM PSI until \nbeing confronted with the facts from his CBR. No one provided him responsible advice to \nconceal his debts. He continued to provide incredible and contradictory explanations for \nhis falsification throughout the record proceedings, and failed to mitigate the doubts it cast \non his trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, who \nis accountable for the financial irresponsibility he has displayed since 2016, resulting in \nmore than $85,000 in unresolved delinquent debt. He further demonstrated \nuntrustworthiness through his attempts to conceal those issues, and his subsequent \n\n \n \n \n \n11 \nefforts to justify those attempts. Significant potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress \ncontinues to exist. Overall, the evidence establishes substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. He failed to meet his burden to mitigate the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising under the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct guidelines.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.f, 1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility to \noccupy a designated sensitive position.

I find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nFebruary 16, 2017, seeking to continue a clearance required for his position with a \nfederal contractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \non October 4, 2018, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR on October 24, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). \n \nDOHA assigned the case to another administrative judge on January 9, 2019, \nand reassigned it to me on September 12, 2019. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 18, 2019, setting the hearing for October 10, 2019. At the hearing, the \nGovernment offered eight exhibits (GE 1 through 8). Applicant testified and submitted \n15 exhibits (AE 1 through 15). AE 13 through 15 were received post-hearing. All exhibits \n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere admitted without objection. Hearing exhibit (HE) 1 is the Government\u2019s discovery \nletter that I marked and made part of the record. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on October 21, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in July \n2008, and his nonpriority unsecured debts were discharged totaling about $216,000 \n(mostly in credit card debts) in October 2008, and that he subsequently acquired two \ndelinquent accounts that were charged off (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, owing $36,364, and 1.b, owing \n$26,858), totaling $64,222. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and submitted \ncomments in mitigation. His SOR admissions, and those at the hearing, are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is a 1984 high \nschool graduate. He last attended college around 1995, and has completed about two \nyears of college courses, but they are insufficient for a college degree. Applicant \nmarried in 2001. He and his wife have three children and eight grandchildren.  \n \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Air Force between 1985 and October \n1988. After his discharge, he joined the National Guard where he apparently served two \nyears. He possessed a secret clearance while on active duty that was continued into his \nNational Guard service, and then, it was continued when he started to work for federal \ncontractors to present. He believes that his clearance was upgraded to top secret in \nabout 2017. (Tr. 9) \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history indicates he worked for a private company between \nMarch 2001 and March 2002. He was laid off in March 2002 and was unemployed until \nMarch 2003. He worked for private companies between March 2003 and January 2008. \nHe worked as a recruiter specialist for a military service between January 2008 and \nNovember 2008. He was unemployed, in between contracts, between November 2008 \nand January 2009. A federal contractor hired him as an information technology (IT) \nspecialist between January 2009 and October 2010. He was unemployed for about five \nmonths between October 2010 and February 2011. \n \nApplicant worked for two federal contractors between February 2011 and \nSeptember 2012, and was deployed as a field engineer in support of U.S. personnel in \nthe Middle East. He was unemployed between September 2012 and January 2013. \nApparently, he took a break on his employment after he returned from an overseas tour \nto study for certifications required for his employment. (GE 4) He worked for federal \ncontractors in the United States and was deployed to the Middle East twice between \nNovember 2014 and March 2016, and then from August 2016 to December 2016. (Tr. \n58-60) He was hired as a senior field technician by his current employer and clearance \nsponsor, a federal contractor, in January 2017. He is currently deployed to Europe. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nConcerning his financial problems, Applicant credibly explained that he was a \nvictim of the 2007 \u2013 2008 financial crisis. He and his wife purchased their primary \nresidence in 2002 - 2003. Before the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis, he purchased three \ninvestment properties, fixed them, and sold them for a profit of about $270,000. He used \nthe profit to purchase a five-acre property with a plan to build a home for himself and his \naging in-laws. \n \nApplicant secured a $490,000 construction loan from a mortgage company and \nstarted building his home. In mid-2007, the construction of the house was half complete \nwhen the mortgage company declared bankruptcy. He tried to obtain another \nconstruction loan, but was unsuccessful. He used his credit cards in an attempt to finish \nthe construction of the house, but failed. Applicant had to short-sell the five-acre \nproperty and took a financial loss. Applicant had the foresight to never mortgage his \nprimary residence as collateral for the new construction and was able to keep it after the \nbankruptcy discharge. (Tr. 31-39; AE 6 provides some evidence of profit from the sale \nof one property.) \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant explained that he purchased a $35,000 \nmotorhome in December 2016, after coming back from a deployment to Afghanistan. \nHe believed that the purchase would allow him to spend more time with his wife while in \nthe United States. He was scheduled to attend training in two different states for long \nperiods, and was scheduled to deploy again after the completion of his training. \nApplicant planned on living in the motorhome with his family, and to sell his home ahead \nof his upcoming deployment. However, his wife is a postal worker employee who is \nreceiving worker\u2019s compensation since 1999. She was concerned about losing her long-\ntime doctor and refused to move or travel with Applicant. He attempted to sell the \nmotorhome without success, and when he could no longer afford the payments, he \nvoluntarily returned the motorhome to the lender. \n \nApplicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that he made payments on the \nmotorhome note between December 2016 and December 2017. He contacted the \ncreditor in March 2018, and attempted to set up a payment plan. The manager of the \ncredit union indicated that he would agree to a payment plan provided Applicant\u2019s credit \ncard balance was below $5,000. At that time, Applicant\u2019s credit card balance was about \n$13 - 14,000, because of expenses required for repairs to his primary home resulting \nfrom a leaking roof and mold issues. It took Applicant until October 2019 to lower the \nbalance on the credit card to about $3,000. \n \nIn September 2019, the credit union offered Applicant several payment options. \nIn December 2019, consistent with the offer, Applicant established a $374 monthly \nelectronic payment to resolve this debt. (AE 13) \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant explained that he opened a bank account in \nNovember 2015 for a long-time friend, and gave his friend access to two credit-card \naccounts because he was pending a divorce and needed financial assistance. Applicant \nbelieved his friend would repay any charges he made in the accounts. During two years, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant provided financial support to his friend, who overcharged the account alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b. In a sworn statement, the friend admitted the account was his debt. He \nhas continued to promise to repay the debt, but he does not have the financial means to \nrepay it. (AE 5; Tr. 40-46) \n \nAppellant made three payments on this account after it was closed by the credit \nunion, and he contacted the credit union personnel three times hoping they would open \nthe account and let him make payments, but to no avail. If the creditors agree, Applicant \nintends to pay the charged-off accounts one at a time. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his financial situation. He claimed that he has \nlearned a hard lesson and promised to be financially responsible in the future. He \nbelieves that his overall financial situation is good. He is never late on his mortgage \npayments, and his earnings are sufficient for him to pay his living expenses and current \ndebts. Applicant believes he is doing the best he can do in his current circumstances. \nHe is concerned about not getting his clearance, losing his job, and having to repay his \nemployer for his current relocation expenses to Europe that are close to $100,000.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 credit report (GE 8) shows a total of 31 \u201ctrades\u201d with 29 trades \nin good standing. The only derogatory trades concern the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; and DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended. The case will be adjudicated under the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), applicable to all \nadjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. His \nnonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in 2008, following a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nproceeding. Following the bankruptcy discharge, he acquired two delinquent accounts \nthat were charged off. AG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013), the Appeal Board \nconcisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that some of the mitigating conditions \nare sufficiently established by the evidence and are applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) partially \napplies because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing. However, I \nbelieve that the circumstances are unlikely to recur, and they do not cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond his control that contributed to or \naggravated his financial situation, such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis, his overseas \ndeployments, his short periods of unemployment, and his misplaced reliance on his \nlong-time friend. He presented some evidence of reasonable efforts to pay, settle, or \notherwise resolve his delinquent accounts before he was served with the SOR in \nOctober 2018. I find that he was financially responsible under the circumstances.  \n \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s purchase of the motorhome was reasonable \nin light of his circumstances. He made payments for a year and tried to sell the \nmotorhome when his wife refused to travel with him because of her own health \nproblems. Applicant attempted to enter into a payment agreement with the creditor. In \nSeptember 2019, the credit union offered Applicant several payment options. In \nDecember 2019, Applicant established a $374 monthly electronic payment to resolve \nthis debt. \n \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant\u2019s opening two credit accounts and a bank \naccount for a friend in financial need. Although commendable from a humanitarian \nperspective, \nhis \nactions \nwere \nunreasonable \nand \nshow \nlack \nof \njudgment. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant was trying to help a long-time friend and he mistakenly \nanticipated that his friend would repay the charges.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly stated his desire and intent to pay his delinquent debts. He first \nreduced a high balance credit card to then address the two SOR delinquent debts. He \nstarted payments on the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in December 2019. I anticipate \nhe will also address and pay the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in the near future. Applicant \nshould have been more diligent addressing his debts. Notwithstanding, I find his recent \nefforts, when considered in light of the evidence as a whole, sufficient to mitigate the \nfinancial security concerns. In particular, I note that Applicant\u2019s credit reports do not \nreflect a history of financial problems relating to any additional delinquent accounts. \nExcept for the accounts alleged in the SOR, they reflect a history of financial \nresponsibility. \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, I find that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is \nstable and that his financial problems are under control. He established a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. I believe that given time, he will continue to resolve his two \noutstanding debts. The financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant, 55, has about five years of active and National Guard service in the Air \nForce and has been working for federal contractors since 2008. He held a clearance \nwhile in the service that has been continued to present without incidents or concerns, \nexcept for those in the SOR. He has volunteered for deployments to the Middle East \nthree times in support of U.S. interests in dangerous environments. Some of his \nfinancial problems arose while he was deployed. He receives some mitigating credit \nbecause of the difficulties he likely faced attempting to resolve his financial problems \nfrom abroad.  \n \nApplicant should have been more responsible addressing his delinquent financial \nobligation. Notwithstanding, considering the evidence as a whole, he has demonstrated \ngood judgment and reliability. The evidence from his credit reports showing numerous \naccounts that are current or paid is sufficient to establish a track record of financial \nresponsibility. He recently established a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nI believe that given additional time, Applicant will resolve his remaining financial \nobligations. He is fully aware of the security concerns raised by his failure to maintain \nfinancial responsibility. He promised to maintain financial responsibility to ensure that he \ncontinues to be eligible for a clearance. He understands that if he fails to honor his \nfinancial obligations his clearance eligibility will be denied. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",
